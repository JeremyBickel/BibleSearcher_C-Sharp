Phrasal Composition -> phrasal synonyms
_________________

If the count is greater than the number of words in the longer phrase, that phrase is made up of other phrasal units in a complex way.

1) Find the tree of longer phrases (LP) which contains each smaller phrase (SP) when the count of words in any LP is less than the count of parts (CP). 
1a) Only include LP in that tree which also have a CP greater than the number of words in the LP.
1b) Include all LP when an SP is found in any LP with a total CP greater than the count of words in the LP
2) Separate out the SP longer than one word, because the single words SP are obvious and would just clutter up things (like stopwords).

Find synonyms for all these interesting SP to later add to synonyms of individual words. Order them by their count from Phrasal Concordance.

Is the result identical with the counts from English Phrase Counts? If not, what's interesting about it?

This is currently messed up and needs re-coding.

1) The english phrase is composed of more than one original language term (or grammatical mark). So, these might be broken into their respective phrases when dealing with Phrasal Composition.

I seem to have multiple computations of these phrases, but I'm not sure which are from Strongs and which are calculated exhaustively. Look into this later.
