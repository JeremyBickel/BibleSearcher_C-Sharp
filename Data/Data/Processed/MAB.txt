40.1.18.2^having been pledged the mother of him mary - to joseph, before rather coming together of them, she was found in womb having a child out of the spirit holy.
40.1.19.1^joseph now, the husband of her, righteous being, and not willing her to expose publicly, purposed secretly to send away her.
40.1.20.1^these things now of him having pondered, behold, an angel of the lord in a dream appeared to him, saying, joseph, son of david, not you should fear to receive mary as the wife of you;
40.1.20.2^that for in her having been conceived, from the spirit is, holy.
40.1.21.1^she will bear then a son, and you will call the name of him jesus;
40.1.21.2^he for will save the people of him from the sins of them.
40.1.22.1^this then all has come to pass, that may be fulfilled that having been spoken by the lord through the prophet, saying,
40.1.23.1^behold, the virgin in womb will hold, and will bear a son, and they will call the name of him immanuel,  which is being translated, with us - god.
40.1.24.1^having been awoken then - joseph from the sleep, he did as had commanded him the angel of the lord, and received the wife of him,
40.1.25.1^and not knew her until that she had brought forth a son;
40.1.25.2^and he called the name of him jesus.
40.2.1.1^- now jesus having been born in bethlehem - of judea, in the days of herod the king, behold, magi from the east arrived in jerusalem,
40.2.2.1^saying, where is the one having been born king of the jews?
40.2.2.2^we saw for of him the star in the east, and are come to worship him.
40.2.3.1^having heard then - king herod, he was troubled, and all jerusalem with him.
40.2.4.1^and having gathered together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he was inquiring of them where the christ was to be born.
40.2.5.1^- and they said to him, in bethlehem - of judea, thus for has it been written through the prophet:
40.2.6.1^and you, bethlehem, land of judah, by no means least are among the rulers of judah, out of you for will go forth one leading, who will shepherd the people of me - israel.
40.2.7.1^then herod, secretly having called the magi, inquired exactly of them the time of the appearing star.
40.2.8.1^and having sent them to bethlehem, he said, having gone, search carefully for the child;
40.2.8.2^when then you shall have found him, bring word back to me, so that i also having come, may worship him.
40.2.9.1^- and having heard the king, they went away;
40.2.9.2^and behold, the star which they saw in the east went before them until having arrived, it stood over where was the child.
40.2.10.1^having seen now the star, they rejoiced with joy great exceedingly.
40.2.11.1^and having come into the house, they found the child with mary the mother of him, and having fallen down, they worshiped him;
40.2.11.2^and having opened the treasures of them, they offered to him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.
40.2.12.1^and having been divinely warned in a dream not to return to herod, by another route they withdrew into the country of them.
40.2.13.1^having withdrawn then of them, behold, an angel of the lord appears in a dream - to joseph, saying, having arisen, take the child and the mother of him, and flee into egypt, and remain there until - i should tell you;
40.2.13.2^is about for herod to seek the child, - to destroy him.
40.2.14.1^- and having arisen, he took the child and the mother of him by night and withdrew into egypt,
40.2.15.1^and he remained there until the death of herod;
40.2.15.2^so that it might be fulfilled that having been spoken by the lord through the prophet, saying, out of egypt have i called the son of me.
40.2.16.1^then herod, having seen that he had been outwitted by the magi, was enraged intensely, and having sent forth, he put to death all the boys that were in bethlehem and in all the vicinity of it, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had ascertained from the magi.
40.2.17.1^then was fulfilled that having been spoken by jeremiah the prophet, saying,
40.2.18.1^a voice in ramah was heard, weeping and mourning great, rachel weeping for the children of her, and not would be comforted, because no more are they.
40.2.19.1^having died now - of herod, behold, an angel of the lord appears in a dream to joseph in egypt,
40.2.20.1^saying, having arisen, take the child and the mother of him, and go into the land of israel;
40.2.20.2^they have died for those seeking the life of the child.
40.2.21.1^- and having arisen, he took the child and the mother of him and came into the land of israel.
40.2.22.1^having heard now that archelaus reigns over - judea in place of the father of him herod, he was afraid there to go;
40.2.22.2^having been divinely warned now in a dream, he withdrew into the district - of galilee,
40.2.23.1^and having come, he dwelt in a city being called nazareth;
40.2.23.2^so that it should be fulfilled that having been spoken through the prophets, that a nazarene he will be called.
40.3.1.1^in then the days those, comes john the baptist, preaching in the wilderness - of judea,
40.3.2.1^and saying, repent;
40.3.2.2^has drawn near for the kingdom of the heavens.
40.3.3.1^this for is the one having been spoken of through isaiah the prophet, saying, the voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of the lord;
40.3.3.2^straight make the paths of him.
40.3.4.1^himself now - john had the garment of him of hair of a camel, and a belt of leather around the waist of him, - and the food was of him locusts and honey wild.
40.3.5.1^at that time were going out to him jerusalem, and all - judea, and all the region around the jordan,
40.3.6.1^and were being baptized in the jordan river by him, confessing the sins of them.
40.3.7.1^having seen now many of the pharisees and sadducees coming to the baptism of him, he said to them, brood of vipers, who forewarned you to flee from the coming wrath?
40.3.8.1^produce therefore fruit worthy - of repentance.
40.3.9.1^and not presume to say within yourselves, as father we have - abraham.
40.3.9.2^i say for to you that able is - god out of the stones these to raise up children unto abraham.
40.3.10.1^already now the ax to the root of the trees is applied;
40.3.10.2^every therefore tree not producing fruit good is cut down and into the fire is thrown.
40.3.11.1^i indeed you baptize with water to repentance, - but after me is coming mightier than i, he of whom not i am fit the sandals to carry.
40.3.11.2^he you will baptize with the spirit holy and with fire,
40.3.12.1^whose - winnowing fork is in the hand of him;
40.3.12.2^and he will clear the threshing floor of him and will gather the wheat of him into the barn;
40.3.12.3^the but chaff he will burn up with fire unquenchable.
40.3.13.1^then comes - jesus from - galilee to the jordan, unto - john, - to be baptized by him.
40.3.14.1^- but john was hindering him, saying, i need have by you to be baptized, and you come to me?
40.3.15.1^answering, however, - jesus said unto him, permit it presently;
40.3.15.2^thus for fitting it is to us to fulfill all righteousness.
40.3.15.3^then he permits him.
40.3.16.1^having been baptized now, - jesus immediately went up from the water;
40.3.16.2^and behold, were opened to him the heavens, and he saw the spirit of god descending as a dove, and alighting upon him.
40.3.17.1^and behold, a voice out of the heavens, saying, this is the son of me, the beloved, in whom i was well pleased.
40.4.1.1^then - jesus was led up into the wilderness by the spirit to be tempted by the devil.
40.4.2.1^and having fasted days forty and nights, forty afterward he was hungry.
40.4.3.1^and having come the one tempting, he said to him, if son you are - of god, speak, that the stones these, loaves of bread might become.
40.4.4.1^- but answering, he said, it has been written:
40.4.4.2^not by bread alone shall live the man, but by every word coming out of the mouth of god.
40.4.5.1^then takes him the devil to the holy city and sets him upon the pinnacle of the temple,
40.4.6.1^and says to him, if son you are - of god, throw yourself down;
40.4.6.2^it has been written for -:
40.4.6.3^to the angels of him he will give orders concerning you, and in their hands will they bear up you, lest ever you strike against a stone the foot of you.
40.4.7.1^said to him - jesus, again it has been written:
40.4.7.2^not you shall test the lord the god of you.
40.4.8.1^again takes him the devil to a mountain high exceedingly, and shows to him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them,
40.4.9.1^and he says to him, these things to you all will i give, if falling down, you will worship me.
40.4.10.1^then says to him - jesus, get you away, satan;
40.4.10.2^it has been written for:
40.4.10.3^the lord the god of you, you shall worship, and him alone shall you serve.
40.4.11.1^then leaves him the devil, and behold, angels came and were ministering to him.
40.4.12.1^having heard now that john had been delivered up , he withdrew into - galilee.
40.4.13.1^and having left - nazareth, having come, he dwelt at capernaum, which is on the sea-side in the region of zebulun and naphtali,
40.4.14.1^that it might be fulfilled that having been spoken by isaiah the prophet, saying:
40.4.15.1^land of zebulun and land of naphtali, way of the sea, beyond the jordan, galilee of the gentiles
40.4.16.1^the people - sitting in darkness, a light have seen great, and to those sitting in the land and shadow of death, a light has dawned on them.
40.4.17.1^from that time began - jesus to proclaim and to say, repent, has drawn near for the kingdom of the heavens.
40.4.18.1^walking now beside the sea - of galilee, he saw two brothers, simon - called peter, and andrew the brother of him, casting a net into the sea;
40.4.18.2^they were for fishermen.
40.4.19.1^and he says to them, come follow after me, and i will make you fishers of men.
40.4.20.1^- and immediately having left the nets, they followed him.
40.4.21.1^and having gone on from there, he saw others, two brothers, james the son - of zebedee, and john the brother of him, in the boat with zebedee the father of them, mending the nets of them;
40.4.21.2^and he called them.
40.4.22.1^- and immediately, having left the boat and the father of them, they followed him.
40.4.23.1^and he was going throughout all - galilee, teaching in the synagogues of them, and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
40.4.24.1^and went out the news of him into all - syria.
40.4.24.2^and they brought to him all the sick having various diseases and pains oppressing, and being possessed by demons, and being epileptics, and paralytics;
40.4.24.3^and he healed them.
40.4.25.1^and followed him crowds great from - galilee, and the decapolis, and jerusalem, and judea, and beyond the jordan.
40.5.1.1^having seen then the crowds, he went up on the mountain;
40.5.1.2^and having sat down of him, came to him the disciples of him.
40.5.2.1^and opening the mouth of him, he was teaching them, saying:
40.5.3.1^blessed are the poor in the spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.
40.5.4.1^blessed are those mourning, for they will be comforted.
40.5.5.1^blessed the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
40.5.6.1^blessed are those hungering and thirsting for - righteousness;
40.5.6.2^for they will be filled.
40.5.7.1^blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy.
40.5.8.1^blessed the pure - in heart, for they - god will see.
40.5.9.1^blessed the peacemakers, for they sons of god will be called.
40.5.10.1^blessed are those having been persecuted on account of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.
40.5.11.1^blessed are you when they shall insult you, and shall persecute you, and shall say all kinds of evil against you, lying on account of me.
40.5.12.1^rejoice and exult, for the reward of you is great in the heavens;
40.5.12.2^thus for they persecuted the prophets - before you.
40.5.13.1^you are the salt of the earth;
40.5.13.2^if, however, the salt becomes tasteless, with what will it be salted.
40.5.13.3^for nothing it is potent any longer, if not having been cast out, to be trampled upon by - men.
40.5.14.1^you are the light of the world.
40.5.14.2^not is able a city to be hidden on a hill lying.
40.5.15.1^nor do they light a lamp and put it under - a basket, but upon the lampstand, and it shines for all those in the house.
40.5.16.1^thus let shine the light of you before - men, so that they may see your - good works, and they should glorify the father of you - in the heavens.
40.5.17.1^not think that i have come to abolish the law or the prophets;
40.5.17.2^not i have come to abolish, but to fulfill.
40.5.18.1^truly for i say to you, until - shall pass away the heaven and the earth, iota one, or one stroke of a letter, no not shall pass away from the law, until - everything should happen.
40.5.19.1^whoever if then shall break one of the commandments of these the least and shall teach so the others, least he will be called in the kingdom of the heavens;
40.5.19.2^whoever now - shall keep and shall teach them, this one great will be called in the kingdom of the heavens.
40.5.20.1^i say for to you, that if not shall abound your - righteousness above that of the scribes and pharisees, no not shall you enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
40.5.21.1^you have heard that it was said to the ancients, not you shall murder;
40.5.21.2^whoever now - shall murder, liable will be to the judgment.
40.5.22.1^i however say to you that everyone - being angry with the brother of him liable will be to the judgment;
40.5.22.2^whoever now - shall say to brother of him, raca,  liable will be to the sanhedrin;
40.5.22.3^whoever now - shall say, fool, liable will be to the hell - of fire.
40.5.23.1^if therefore you shall offer the gift of you at the altar, and there shall remember that the brother of you has something against you,
40.5.24.1^leave there the gift of you before the altar, and go away;
40.5.24.2^first be reconciled to brother of you;
40.5.24.3^and then having come, offer the gift of you.
40.5.25.1^be agreeing with accuser of you quickly, while which you are with him, on the way, lest ever you deliver the accuser to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and into prison you will be cast.
40.5.26.1^truly i say to you, no not shall you come out from there, until - you should pay the last kodranten!
40.5.27.1^you have heard that it was said, not shall you commit adultery.
40.5.28.1^i however say to you that everyone - looking upon a woman in order - to lust after her already has committed adultery with her in the heart of him.
40.5.29.1^if now the eye of you - right causes to stumble you, pluck out it and cast it from you;
40.5.29.2^it is better indeed for you that should perish one of the members of you, and not all the body of you should be cast into hell.
40.5.30.1^and if the right of you hand causes to stumble you, cut off it and cast it from you;
40.5.30.2^it is better indeed for you that should perish one of the members of you, and not all the body of you into hell should depart.
40.5.31.1^it was said also, whoever - shall divorce the wife of him, let him give to her a letter of divorce.
40.5.32.1^i however say to you that everyone - divorcing the wife of him, except on account of sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery.
40.5.32.2^and whoever if her having been divorced shall marry, commits adultery.
40.5.33.1^again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients, not shall you swear falsely;
40.5.33.2^you shall keep now to the lord the oaths of you.
40.5.34.1^i however say to you not to swear at all:
40.5.34.2^neither by - heaven, because the throne it is - of god;
40.5.35.1^nor by the earth, because the footstool it is of the feet of him;
40.5.35.2^nor by jerusalem, because the city it is of the great king.
40.5.36.1^neither by the head of you shall you swear, because not you are able one hair white to make, or black.
40.5.37.1^let it be however the statement of you, yes,  yes, and  no, no.
40.5.37.2^the however more than these, from - evil comes.
40.5.38.1^you have heard that it was said, eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.
40.5.39.1^i however say to you, not to resist the evil person.
40.5.39.2^instead, whoever you shall strike on the right cheek of you, turn to him also the other;
40.5.40.1^and to the one willing you to sue and the tunic of you to take, yield to him also the cloak;
40.5.41.1^and whoever you shall compel to go mile one, go with him two.
40.5.42.1^to the one asking of you, give;
40.5.42.2^and the one desiring from you to borrow, not you shall turn away from.
40.5.43.1^you have heard that it was said, you shall love - neighbor of you and shall hate - enemy of you.
40.5.44.1^i however say to you, love the enemies of you, and pray for those persecuting you,
40.5.45.1^so that you may be sons of the father of you who is in the heavens.
40.5.45.2^for the sun of him he makes rise on evil and good, and he sends rain on righteous and unrighteous.
40.5.46.1^if for you love those loving you, what reward have you?
40.5.46.2^do not also the tax collectors the same do?
40.5.47.1^and if you greet the brothers of you only, what extraordinary do you?
40.5.47.2^do not also the gentiles the same do?
40.5.48.1^shall be therefore you perfect, as the father of you who is heavenly, perfect is.
40.6.1.1^beware now the righteousness of you not to do before - men in order - to be seen by them;
40.6.1.2^if now - otherwise, reward not have you with the father of you who is in the heavens.
40.6.2.1^when therefore you do acts of charity, not do sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may have glory from - men.
40.6.2.2^truly i say to you, they have the reward of them.
40.6.3.1^you however doing charity, not let know the left hand of you what is doing the right hand of you,
40.6.4.1^so that may be your - giving in - secret.
40.6.4.2^and the father of you, the one seeing in - secret, will reward you.
40.6.5.1^and when you pray, not you shall be like the hypocrites, for they love in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets standing to pray, so that they might be seen - by men.
40.6.5.2^truly i say to you, they have the reward of them.
40.6.6.1^you however, when you pray, enter into the room of you, and having shut the door of you, pray to father of you, the one in - secret.
40.6.6.2^and the father of you, the one seeing in - secret, will reward you.
40.6.7.1^praying now not do use vain repetitions, like the pagans, they think for that in the many words of them they will be heard.
40.6.8.1^not therefore be like to them, knows for the father of you of what things need you have, before - your asking him.
40.6.9.1^thus therefore pray you:
40.6.9.2^father of us, who is in the heavens, hallowed be the name of you.
40.6.10.1^come the kingdom of you;
40.6.10.2^be done the will of you, as in heaven, so also upon earth.
40.6.11.1^the bread of us - daily grant us today.
40.6.12.1^and forgive us the debts of us, as also we forgive the debtors of us;
40.6.13.1^and not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from - evil.
40.6.14.1^if for you forgive - men the trespasses of them, will forgive also you the father of you - heavenly.
40.6.15.1^if however not you forgive - men, neither the father of you will forgive the trespasses of you.
40.6.16.1^whenever now you fast, not be like the hypocrites, gloomy;
40.6.16.2^they disfigure for the appearance of them, so that they might appear - to men as fasting.
40.6.16.3^truly i say to you, they have the reward of them.
40.6.17.1^you however, fasting, anoint your - head and the face of you wash,
40.6.18.1^so that not you might appear - to men as fasting, but - to father your the one in - secret;
40.6.18.2^and the father of you, the one seeing in - secret, will reward you.
40.6.19.1^not store up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal;
40.6.20.1^store up however for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroy, and where thieves not do break in nor steal.
40.6.21.1^where for is the treasure of you, there will be also the heart of you.
40.6.22.1^the lamp of the body is the eye.
40.6.22.2^if therefore is the eye of you clear, the whole - body of you full of light will be.
40.6.23.1^if however the eye of you evil is, all the body of you full of darkness will be.
40.6.23.2^if then the light that is within you darkness is, that darkness how great!
40.6.24.1^no one is able two masters to serve;
40.6.24.2^either for the one he will hate, and the other he will love;
40.6.24.3^or the one he will be devoted to, and the other he will despise.
40.6.24.4^not you are able god to serve, and money.
40.6.25.1^because of this i say to you, not be anxious about the life of you, what you should eat or what you should drink;
40.6.25.2^nor the body of you, what you should put on.
40.6.25.3^not the life more is than the food, and the body than clothing?
40.6.26.1^look at the birds of the air, that not they sow, nor do they reap, nor do they gather into barns   and the father of you - heavenly feeds them.
40.6.26.2^not you much are more valuable than they?
40.6.27.1^who now from you being anxious is able to add to the lifespan of him hour one?
40.6.28.1^and about clothing why are you anxious?
40.6.28.2^observe the lilies of the field, how they grow:
40.6.28.3^they do not labor nor do they spin.
40.6.29.1^i say however to you that not even solomon in all the glory of him was adorned like one of these.
40.6.30.1^if however the grass of the field, today being here, and tomorrow into the furnace being thrown, - god thus clothes, will he not much more you, o you of little faith?
40.6.31.1^not therefore be anxious, saying, what shall we eat?
40.6.31.2^or what shall we drink?
40.6.31.3^or what shall we wear?
40.6.32.1^all for these things the gentiles seek after;
40.6.32.2^knows for the father of you - heavenly that you have need of them all.
40.6.33.1^seek however first the kingdom of god and the righteousness of him, and these things all will be added to you.
40.6.34.1^not therefore be anxious about things tomorrow, - for tomorrow will be anxious about itself.
40.6.34.2^sufficient to the day is the trouble of it.
40.7.1.1^not do judge, that not you should be judged.
40.7.2.1^with whatever for verdict you judge, you will be judged;
40.7.2.2^and with whatever measure you measure, it will be measured again to you.
40.7.3.1^why now do you look at the splinter that is in the eye the brother of you, - and the in - your own eye beam not notice?
40.7.4.1^or how shall you say to the brother of you, permit that i might cast out the splinter from the eye of you;
40.7.4.2^and behold, the beam is in the eye of you?
40.7.5.1^hypocrite!
40.7.5.2^cast out first from the eye of you the beam, and then you will see clearly to cast out the splinter from the eye of the brother of you.
40.7.6.1^not give that which is holy to the dogs, nor cast the pearls of you before the pigs, not lest they shall trample upon them with the feet of them, and having turned, they tear to pieces you.
40.7.7.1^ask and it will be given to you;
40.7.7.2^seek and you will find;
40.7.7.3^knock and it will be opened to you.
40.7.8.1^everyone for - asking receives;
40.7.8.2^and the one seeking, finds;
40.7.8.3^and to the one knocking, it will be opened.
40.7.9.1^or which is of you a man whom will ask for the son of him bread, not a stone will he give him?
40.7.10.1^or also a fish he will ask for, not a serpent will he give him?
40.7.11.1^if therefore you, evil being, know gifts good to give to the children of you, how much more the father of you who is in the heavens will give good things to those asking him!
40.7.12.1^all things therefore, as many as if you might desire that should do to you the men, so also you do to them.
40.7.12.2^this for is the law and the prophets.
40.7.13.1^enter through the narrow gate.
40.7.13.2^for wide is the gate and broad the way - leading to - destruction, and many are those entering through it.
40.7.14.1^for small is the gate and compressed the way - leading to - life, and few are those finding it.
40.7.15.1^but beware of the false prophets, who come to you in clothing of sheep;
40.7.15.2^inwardly however they are wolves ravenous.
40.7.16.1^by the fruits of them you will know them.
40.7.16.2^not do they gather from thorns grapes, or from thistles figs?
40.7.17.1^so every tree good, fruits good produces;
40.7.17.2^- but the bad tree, fruits bad produces.
40.7.18.1^not is able a tree good, fruits bad to produce;
40.7.18.2^nor a tree bad, fruits good to produce.
40.7.19.1^every tree not producing fruit good is cut down and into fire is thrown.
40.7.20.1^- then surely by the fruits of them you will know them.
40.7.21.1^not everyone - saying to me, lord, lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the will the father of me, who is in the heavens.
40.7.22.1^many will say to me in that the day, lord, lord, not in your name did we prophesy, and in your name demons cast out, and in your name miracles many perform?
40.7.23.1^and then i will declare to them -, never knew i you;
40.7.23.2^depart you from me, those working - lawlessness.
40.7.24.1^everyone therefore, whoever hears my - words these, and does them, will be like a man wise, who built his - house upon the rock.
40.7.25.1^and came down the rain, and came the torrents, and blew the winds, and beat that house upon;
40.7.25.2^and not it fell, it had been founded for upon the rock.
40.7.26.1^and everyone - hearing my - words these, and not doing them, he will be likened to a man foolish, who built of him the house upon the sand.
40.7.27.1^and came down the rain, and came the torrents, and blew the winds, and beat that house upon, and it fell   and was the fall of it great.
40.7.28.1^and it came to pass, when had finished - jesus the words these, were astonished the crowds at the teaching of him.
40.7.29.1^he was for teaching them as authority having, and not as the scribes of them.
40.8.1.1^having come down now he from the mountain, followed him crowds great.
40.8.2.1^and behold, a leper having come, was worshipping him, saying, lord, if you are willing, you are able me to cleanse.
40.8.3.1^and having stretched out the hand, he touched him, saying, i am willing;
40.8.3.2^be you cleansed!
40.8.3.3^and immediately was cleansed his - leprosy.
40.8.4.1^and says to him - jesus, see that no one you tell.
40.8.4.2^but go, yourself show to the priest, and offer the gift that commanded moses, for a testimony to them.
40.8.5.1^having entered now he into capernaum, came to him a centurion, imploring him,
40.8.6.1^and saying, lord, the servant of me is lying in the house, paralyzed, grievously tormented.
40.8.7.1^and he says to him, i having come, will heal him.
40.8.8.1^and answering the centurion said, lord, not i am worthy that of me under the roof you should come;
40.8.8.2^but only speak the word, and will be healed the servant of me.
40.8.9.1^also for i a man am under authority, having under me soldiers;
40.8.9.2^and i say to this one, go, and he goes;
40.8.9.3^and to another, come, and he comes;
40.8.9.4^and to the servant of me, do this, and he does it.
40.8.10.1^having heard now, - jesus marveled, and said to those following, truly i say to you, except no one so great faith in - israel have i found.
40.8.11.1^i say now to you that many from east and west will come, and will recline with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of the heavens;
40.8.12.1^the however sons of the kingdom will be cast out, into the darkness the outer, there will be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.
40.8.13.1^and said - jesus to the centurion, go, as you have believed, be it to you.
40.8.13.2^and was healed the servant of him in the hour that.
40.8.14.1^and having come - jesus to the house of peter, he saw the mother-in-law of him lying sick and fevering.
40.8.15.1^and he touched the hand of her, and left her the fever;
40.8.15.2^and she arose and was ministering to them.
40.8.16.1^evening now having come, they brought to him being possessed with demons many, and he cast out the spirits by a word, and all those sick being, he healed,
40.8.17.1^so that it might be fulfilled that having been spoken by isaiah the prophet, saying, himself the infirmities of us he took, and our diseases bore.
40.8.18.1^having seen now - jesus a crowd around him, he commanded to depart to the other side.
40.8.19.1^and having come to him, one scribe said to him, teacher, i will follow you wherever if you might go.
40.8.20.1^and says to him - jesus, - foxes holes have, and the birds of the air nests;
40.8.20.2^- but the son - of man, no has place where the head he might lay.
40.8.21.1^another now of the disciples of him said to him, lord, allow me first to go and to bury the father of me.
40.8.22.1^- but jesus said to him, follow me, and leave the dead to bury - their own dead.
40.8.23.1^and having entered he into the boat, followed him the disciples of him.
40.8.24.1^and behold, a storm great arose in the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves;
40.8.24.2^he himself however was sleeping.
40.8.25.1^and having come to him, they awoke him, saying, lord, save us, we are perishing!
40.8.26.1^and he says to them, why fearful are you, o you of little faith?
40.8.26.2^then, having arisen, he rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a calm great.
40.8.27.1^- and the men marveled, saying, what kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea him obey?
40.8.28.1^and having come he to the other side, to the region of the gadarenes, met him two being possessed by demons, out of the tombs coming forth, violent extremely, so that not was able anyone to pass by the way that.
40.8.29.1^and behold, they cried out, saying, what to us and to you, son - of god?
40.8.29.2^are you come here before the time to torment us?
40.8.30.1^there was now far off from them a herd of pigs many, feeding.
40.8.31.1^- and the demons were begging him, saying, if you cast out us, send away us into the herd - of pigs.
40.8.32.1^and he said to them, go.
40.8.32.2^- and having gone out they went away into the pigs;
40.8.32.3^and behold, rushed all the herd down the steep bank into the sea, and perished in the waters.
40.8.33.1^those now feeding them fled, and having gone away into the city, they related everything, including the matter of those being possessed by demons.
40.8.34.1^and behold, all the city went out to meet - jesus.
40.8.34.2^and having seen him, they begged him that he would depart from the region of them.
40.9.1.1^and having entered into a boat, he passed over and came to the own city.
40.9.2.1^and behold, they were bringing to him a paralytic on a bed lying.
40.9.2.2^and having seen - jesus the faith of them, he said to the paralytic, take courage, son;
40.9.2.3^have been forgiven of you the sins.
40.9.3.1^and behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, this man blasphemes!
40.9.4.1^and having known - jesus the thoughts of them, he said, so that why think you evil in the hearts of you?
40.9.5.1^which for is easier, to say, are forgiven of you the sins, or to say.
40.9.5.2^arise and walk?
40.9.6.1^so that however you may know that authority has the son - of man on the earth to forgive sins.
40.9.6.2^.
40.9.6.3^.
40.9.6.4^then he says to the paralytic, having arisen, take up your - mat, and go to the house of you.
40.9.7.1^and having arisen, he went away to the house of him.
40.9.8.1^having seen now, the crowds marveled and glorified - god, the one having given authority such - to men.
40.9.9.1^and passing on - jesus from there, he saw a man sitting at the tax booth, matthew named.
40.9.9.2^and he says to him, follow me.
40.9.9.3^and having arisen, he followed him.
40.9.10.1^and it came to pass of him reclining in the house, that behold, many tax collectors and sinners, having come, were reclining with - jesus and the disciples of him.
40.9.11.1^and having seen it, the pharisees said to disciples of him, because of why with the tax collectors and sinners eats the teacher of you?
40.9.12.1^- and having heard, he said, not need have those being strong of a physician, but those sick being.
40.9.13.1^having gone however, learn what is, mercy i desire, and not sacrifice.
40.9.13.2^not for i came to call the righteous, but sinners.
40.9.14.1^then come to him the disciples of john, saying, because of why we and the pharisees do fast many times;
40.9.14.2^the however disciples of you not fast?
40.9.15.1^and said to them - jesus, not can the sons of the bridechamber mourn as long as with them is the bridegroom?
40.9.15.2^will come however days when shall have been taken away from them the bridegroom, and then they will fast.
40.9.16.1^no one however puts a patch of cloth unshrunk on clothing old;
40.9.16.2^tears away for the patch of it from the garment, and a worse tear emerges.
40.9.17.1^nor pour they wine new into wineskins old;
40.9.17.2^if now - lest are burst the wineskins, and the wine is poured out, and the wineskins are destroyed.
40.9.17.3^but they pour wine new into wineskins new, and both are preserved.
40.9.18.1^these things of him speaking to them, behold, a ruler certain having come, was kneeling down to him, saying -, the daughter of me presently has died;
40.9.18.2^but having come, lay the hand of you upon her, and she will live.
40.9.19.1^and having arisen, - jesus followed him, also the disciples of him.
40.9.20.1^and behold, a woman having had a flux of blood twelve years, having come up behind him, touched the fringe of the garment of him.
40.9.21.1^she was saying for within herself, if only i shall touch the garment of him, i will be healed.
40.9.22.1^- and jesus, having turned and having seen her, said, take courage, daughter;
40.9.22.2^the faith of you has cured you.
40.9.22.3^and was cured the woman from the hour very.
40.9.23.1^and having come - jesus into the house of the ruler, and having seen the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,
40.9.24.1^he says, go away.
40.9.24.2^not for is dead the girl, but sleeps.
40.9.24.3^and they began to laugh at him.
40.9.25.1^when now had been put outside the crowd, having entered, he took hold of the hand of her, and arose the girl.
40.9.26.1^and went out the report this into all the land that.
40.9.27.1^and passing on from there - jesus, followed him two blind men, crying out and saying, have mercy on us, son of david.
40.9.28.1^having come now into the house, came to him the blind men, and says to them - jesus, believe you that i am able this to do?
40.9.28.2^they say to him, yes, lord.
40.9.29.1^then he touched the eyes of them, saying, according to the faith of you be it to you.
40.9.30.1^and were opened their - eyes.
40.9.30.2^and strictly instructed them - jesus, saying, see that no one knows.
40.9.31.1^- but having gone out, they make known him in all the land that.
40.9.32.1^as they now were going out, behold, they brought to him a man mute, possessed by a demon.
40.9.33.1^and having been cast out the demon, spoke the mute man.
40.9.33.2^and marveled the crowds, saying, never was it seen thus in - israel.
40.9.34.1^the now pharisees were saying, by the prince of the demons he casts out - demons.
40.9.35.1^and was going throughout - jesus the cities all and the villages, teaching in the synagogues of them, and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness.
40.9.36.1^having seen now the crowds, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were wearied and cast away, as sheep not having a shepherd.
40.9.37.1^then he says to the disciples of him, the indeed harvest is plentiful, the however workmen are few;
40.9.38.1^beseech therefore the lord of the harvest, that he might send out workmen into the harvest of him.
40.10.1.1^and having summoned the twelve disciples of him, he gave to them authority over spirits unclean, so as to cast out them and to heal every disease and every sickness.
40.10.2.1^- and of the twelve apostles the names are these:
40.10.2.2^first simon, - called peter, and andrew, the brother of him;
40.10.2.3^and james the son of zebedee, and john the brother of him;
40.10.3.1^philip, and bartholomew;
40.10.3.2^thomas, and matthew the tax collector;
40.10.3.3^james the son - of alphaeus, and thaddaeus;
40.10.4.1^simon the zealot, and judas - iscariot, the one also having betrayed him.
40.10.5.1^these - twelve sent forth - jesus, having instructed them, saying, into the way of the gentiles not go off, and into any city of the samaritans not enter;
40.10.6.1^go however rather to those sheep - being lost of the house of israel.
40.10.7.1^going on also proclaim, saying -, has drawn near the kingdom of the heavens.
40.10.8.1^those ailing heal, dead raise, lepers cleanse, demons cast out;
40.10.8.2^freely you received, freely give.
40.10.9.1^neither take along gold, nor silver, nor copper in the belts of you,
40.10.10.1^nor provision-bag for the way, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff;
40.10.10.2^worthy is for the workman of the provisions of him.
40.10.11.1^into whatever now - city or village you enter, inquire who in it worthy is, and there remain until - you go forth.
40.10.12.1^entering now into the house, greet it.
40.10.13.1^and if indeed be the house worthy, let come the peace of you upon it;
40.10.13.2^if however not it be worthy, the peace of you to you let return.
40.10.14.1^and whoever - not will receive you, nor will hear the words of you, going forth out of the house or of the city that, shake off the dust of the feet of you!
40.10.15.1^truly i say to you, more tolerable it will be for the land of sodom and of gomorrah on day of judgment, than the city for that.
40.10.16.1^behold, i send forth you as sheep in the midst of wolves;
40.10.16.2^be you therefore shrewd as the serpents, and innocent as the doves.
40.10.17.1^beware however of - men;
40.10.17.2^they will deliver for you into courts, and in the synagogues of them, they will flog you;
40.10.18.1^and before governors also, and kings you will be brought, on account of me, for a testimony to them and to the gentiles.
40.10.19.1^when then they deliver up you, not be anxious how or what you should speak;
40.10.19.2^it will be given for you in that - hour what you should say.
40.10.20.1^not for you are those speaking, but the spirit of the father of you - speaking through you.
40.10.21.1^will deliver up now brother, brother to death;
40.10.21.2^and father, child.
40.10.21.3^and will rise up children against parents, and will put to death them.
40.10.22.1^and you will be hated by all on account of the name of me;
40.10.22.2^the one however having endured to the end, he will be saved.
40.10.23.1^whenever then they persecute you in the city one, flee to the next.
40.10.23.2^truly for i say to you, no not shall you have completed the cities of israel until - be come the son of man.
40.10.24.1^not is a disciple above the teacher, nor a servant above the master of him.
40.10.25.1^it is sufficient for the disciple that he become as the teacher of him, and the servant as the master of him.
40.10.25.2^if the master of the house beelzebul they called, how much more those house members of him!
40.10.26.1^not therefore you should fear them;
40.10.26.2^nothing for is concealed which not will be revealed, or hidden which not will be known.
40.10.27.1^what i tell you in the darkness, speak in the light;
40.10.27.2^and what in the ear you hear, proclaim upon the housetops!
40.10.28.1^and not you should be afraid of those killing the body, the however soul not being able to kill;
40.10.28.2^you should fear however rather the one being able both soul and body to destroy in hell.
40.10.29.1^not two sparrows for an assarion are sold?
40.10.29.2^and one of them not will fall to the ground, apart from the father of you?
40.10.30.1^of you now even the hairs of the head all numbered are.
40.10.31.1^not therefore you should fear;
40.10.31.2^than many sparrows are worth more you.
40.10.32.1^everyone therefore who will confess in me before - men, will confess also i in him before the father of me who is in the heavens.
40.10.33.1^whoever now - shall deny me before - men, will deny i also him before the father of me who is in the heavens.
40.10.34.1^not think that i came to bring peace to the earth;
40.10.34.2^not i came to bring peace, but a sword.
40.10.35.1^i came for to set at variance a man against the father of him, and a daughter against the mother of her, and a daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law of her,
40.10.36.1^and enemies of the man the household of him.
40.10.37.1^the one loving father or mother above me, not is of me worthy;
40.10.37.2^and the one loving son or daughter above me, not is of me worthy.
40.10.38.1^and he who not takes the cross of him and follows after me, not is of me worthy.
40.10.39.1^the one having found the life of him will lose it;
40.10.39.2^and the one having lost the life of him on account of me will find it.
40.10.40.1^the one receiving you, me receives;
40.10.40.2^and the one me receiving, receives the one having sent me.
40.10.41.1^the one receiving a prophet in the name of a prophet, the reward of a prophet will receive;
40.10.41.2^and the one receiving a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, the reward of a righteous man will receive.
40.10.42.1^and whoever - shall give to drink one the little ones of these a cup of cold water, only in the name of a disciple, truly i say to you, no not shall he lose the reward of him.
40.11.1.1^and it came to pass when had finished - jesus commanding the twelve disciples of him, he departed from there - to teach and to preach in the cities of them.
40.11.2.1^- and john, having heard in the prison the works of the christ, having sent two of the disciples of him,
40.11.3.1^said to him, you are the coming one, or another are we to look for?
40.11.4.1^and answering, - jesus said to them, having gone, relate to john what you hear and see:
40.11.5.1^blind receive sight, and lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and deaf hear, and dead are raised, and poor are gospelized.
40.11.6.1^and blessed is he who if not shall fall away in me.
40.11.7.1^as these now were going away, began - jesus to speak to the crowds concerning john:
40.11.7.2^what went you out into the wilderness to see?
40.11.7.3^a reed by the wind shaken?
40.11.8.1^but what did you go out to see?
40.11.8.2^a man in delicate clothing having been dressed?
40.11.8.3^behold, those - delicate clothing wearing, in the houses - of kings are.
40.11.9.1^but what did you go out, to see?
40.11.9.2^a prophet yes, i say to you, and one more excellent than a prophet.
40.11.10.1^for this is he concerning whom it has been written:
40.11.10.2^behold, i send the messenger of me before the face of you, who will prepare the way of you before you.
40.11.11.1^truly i say to you, not there has risen among those born of women one greater than john the baptist.
40.11.11.2^- yet the least in the kingdom of the heavens, greater than he is.
40.11.12.1^from then the days of john the baptist until now, the kingdom of the heavens is taken by violence, and the violent claim it.
40.11.13.1^all for the prophets and the law until john prophesied.
40.11.14.1^and if you are willing to receive it, he is elijah, the one being about to come.
40.11.15.1^the one having ears, let him hear!
40.11.16.1^to what however will i compare the generation this?
40.11.16.2^like it is little children sitting in the markets, and calling out - to others,
40.11.17.1^saying:
40.11.17.2^we piped for you, and not you did dance;
40.11.17.3^we sang a dirge and not you did wail.
40.11.18.1^came for john neither eating nor drinking, and they say, a demon he has!
40.11.19.1^came the son - of man eating and drinking, and they say, behold, a man, a glutton and a drunkard, of tax collectors a friend and of sinners!
40.11.19.2^but is justified - wisdom by the deeds of her.
40.11.20.1^then he began to denounce the cities in which had taken place the most miracles of him, because not they repented.
40.11.21.1^woe to you, chorazin!
40.11.21.2^woe to you, bethsaida!
40.11.21.3^for if in tyre and sidon had taken place the miracles - having come to pass in you, long ago then in sackcloth and ashes they would have repented.
40.11.22.1^but i say to you, for tyre and sidon more tolerable will it be in the day of judgment than for you.
40.11.23.1^and you, capernaum, not to heaven will be exalted, to hades will be brought down!
40.11.23.2^for if in sodom had taken place the miracles - having taken place in you, it would have remained - until the day.
40.11.24.1^but i say to you, that for the land of sodom more tolerable will it be in day of judgment than for you.
40.11.25.1^at that - time answering, - jesus said, i fully consent to you, father, lord of the heaven and the earth, that you did hide these things from wise and learned, and did reveal them to little children.
40.11.26.1^yes, - father, for thus well-pleasing it was before you.
40.11.27.1^all things to me have been delivered by the father of me.
40.11.27.2^and no one knows the son, if not the father;
40.11.27.3^nor the father anyone does know, if not the son, and to whom if might choose the son to reveal him.
40.11.28.1^come to me, all those toiling and being burdened, and i will give rest to you.
40.11.29.1^take the yoke of me upon you and learn from me, for gentle i am and humble in the heart, and you will find rest for the souls of you.
40.11.30.1^the for yoke of me is easy, and the burden of me light is.
40.12.1.1^at that - time went - jesus on the sabbaths through the grainfields, - and the disciples of him were hungry, and they began to pluck the heads of grain and to eat.
40.12.2.1^- and the pharisees, having seen, said to him, behold, the disciples of you are doing what not it is lawful to do on sabbath.
40.12.3.1^- and he said to them, not you have read what did david when he was hungry, and those with him
40.12.4.1^how he entered into the house - of god, and the loaves of the presentation they ate, which not lawful it was for him to eat, nor for those with him, if not for the priests only?
40.12.5.1^or not have you read in the law, that on the sabbath the priests in the temple the sabbath profane, and guiltless are?
40.12.6.1^i say however to you that the temple a greater than is here.
40.12.7.1^if however you had known what is, mercy i desire and not sacrifice,  not - you would have condemned the guiltless.
40.12.8.1^lord for is of the sabbath the son of man.
40.12.9.1^and having departed from there, he went into the synagogue of them.
40.12.10.1^and behold, a man a hand having withered.
40.12.10.2^and they asked him, saying, is it lawful on the sabbaths to heal?
40.12.10.3^so that they might accuse him.
40.12.11.1^- and he said to them, what will there be among you man, who will have sheep one, and if falls it on the sabbaths into a pit, not will he take hold of it and will raise it up?
40.12.12.1^how much therefore is more valuable a man than a sheep!
40.12.12.2^therefore it is lawful on the sabbaths good to do.
40.12.13.1^then he says to the man, stretch out your - hand.
40.12.13.2^and he stretched it out, and it was restored, sound as the other.
40.12.14.1^having gone out now, the pharisees a counsel held against him, how him they might destroy.
40.12.15.1^- and jesus, having known, withdrew from there.
40.12.15.2^and followed him multitudes great, and he healed them all,
40.12.16.1^and he warned them that not known him they should make
40.12.17.1^so that might be fulfilled that having been spoken by isaiah the prophet, saying,
40.12.18.1^behold the servant of me, whom i have chosen, the beloved of me, in whom has found delight the soul of me.
40.12.18.2^i will put the spirit of me upon him, and justice to the gentiles he will proclaim.
40.12.19.1^not will he quarrel nor will he cry out, nor will hear anyone in the streets the voice of him.
40.12.20.1^a reed bruised not he will break, and a wick smoldering not he will quench, until - he leads to victory - justice.
40.12.21.1^and in the name of him the gentiles will hope.
40.12.22.1^then was brought to him one possessed by a demon, blind and mute, and he healed him, in order for the mute man to speak and to see.
40.12.23.1^and were amazed all the crowds, and were saying, whether this is the son of david?
40.12.24.1^- and the pharisees, having heard, said, this man not casts out the demons, if not by - beelzebul prince of the demons.
40.12.25.1^having known now the thoughts of them, he said to them, every kingdom having been divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house having been divided against itself not will stand.
40.12.26.1^and if - satan, - satan casts out, against himself he is divided.
40.12.26.2^how then will stand the kingdom of him?
40.12.27.1^and if i by beelzebul cast out - demons, the sons of you by whom do they cast out?
40.12.27.2^on account of this, they judges will be of you.
40.12.28.1^if however by the spirit of god i cast out - demons, then has come upon you the kingdom - of god.
40.12.29.1^or how is able anyone to enter into the house of the strong man and the goods of him to plunder, if not first he bind the strong man?
40.12.29.2^and then the house of him he will plunder.
40.12.30.1^the one not being with me against me is, and the one not gathering with me scatters.
40.12.31.1^because of this i say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven - men;
40.12.31.2^- however against the spirit blasphemy not will be forgiven.
40.12.32.1^and whoever if speaks a word against the son - of man, it will be forgiven him;
40.12.32.2^whoever now - speaks against - spirit the holy, not it will be forgiven him, neither in this - age nor in the coming one.
40.12.33.1^either make the tree good and the fruit of it good, or make the tree bad and the fruit of it bad;
40.12.33.2^by for the fruit, the tree is known.
40.12.34.1^offspring of vipers, how are you able good things to speak, evil being?
40.12.34.2^out of for the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
40.12.35.1^the good man out of his good treasure puts forth good things;
40.12.35.2^and the evil man out of his evil treasure puts forth evil things.
40.12.36.1^i say now to you that every word careless that will speak - men, they will give of it an account in day of judgment.
40.12.37.1^by for the words of you, you will be justified, and by the words of you, you will be condemned.
40.12.38.1^then answered him some of the scribes and pharisees, saying, teacher, we wish from you a sign to see.
40.12.39.1^- and answering he said to them, a generation evil and adulterous a sign seeks for, and a sign not will be given to it, if not the sign of jonah the prophet.
40.12.40.1^just as for was jonah in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, so will be the son - of man in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
40.12.41.1^the men of nineveh will stand up in the judgment with the generation this, and will condemn it;
40.12.41.2^for they repented at the preaching of jonah;
40.12.41.3^and behold, greater than jonah here.
40.12.42.1^the queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with the generation this, and will condemn it;
40.12.42.2^for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon, and behold, greater than solomon here.
40.12.43.1^when now the unclean spirit is gone out from the man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and none finds it.
40.12.44.1^then it says, to the house of me i will return, from where i came out.
40.12.44.2^and having come, it finds it being unoccupied, swept, and put in order.
40.12.45.1^then it goes and takes with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself, and having entered in they dwell there;
40.12.45.2^and becomes the last of the man that worse than the first.
40.12.45.3^so it will be also unto generation this the evil.
40.12.46.1^while he was speaking to the crowds, behold, the mother and the brothers of him were standing outside, seeking to him to speak.
40.12.47.1^said now someone to him, behold, the mother of you and the brothers of you outside are standing, seeking to you to speak.
40.12.48.1^- and answering, he said to the one telling him, who is the mother of me, and who are the brothers of me?
40.12.49.1^and having stretched out the hand of him to the disciples of him, he said, behold, the mother of me and the brothers of me.
40.12.50.1^whoever for - shall do the will the father of me who is in the heavens, he my brother and sister and mother is.
40.13.1.1^in the day that, having gone forth - jesus from the house, was sitting by the sea.
40.13.2.1^and were gathered together to him crowds great, so that he into a boat having entered sat down, and all the crowd on the shore stood.
40.13.3.1^and he spoke to them many things in parables, saying, behold, went out the one sowing - to sow.
40.13.4.1^and in - sowing of him, some indeed fell along the road, and having come, the birds devoured them.
40.13.5.1^other now fell upon the rocky places, where not it had soil much, and immediately it sprang up, through - not having depth of soil;
40.13.6.1^the sun now having risen, they were scorched, and through the not having root, were dried up.
40.13.7.1^other now fell upon the thorns, and grew up the thorns, and choked them.
40.13.8.1^other now fell upon the soil - good, and were yielding fruit, some indeed a hundredfold, some now sixty, some now thirty.
40.13.9.1^the one having ears, let him hear!
40.13.10.1^and having come to him, the disciples said to him, because of why in parables speak you to them?
40.13.11.1^- and answering, he said to them, because to you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens;
40.13.11.2^to them however not it has been granted.
40.13.12.1^whoever for has, will be given to him, and he will be in abundance;
40.13.12.2^whoever now not has, even what he has will be taken away from him.
40.13.13.1^because of this, in parables to them i speak:
40.13.13.2^because seeing, not do they see;
40.13.13.3^and hearing, not do they hear, nor do they understand.
40.13.14.1^and is fulfilled in them the prophecy of isaiah, - saying:
40.13.14.2^in hearing you will hear, and no not understand;
40.13.14.3^and seeing you will see and no not perceive.
40.13.15.1^has grown dull for the heart of the people this, and with the ears barely they have heard, and the eyes of them they have closed;
40.13.15.2^not lest they should see with the eyes, and with the ears they should hear, and with the heart they should understand, and should return, and i will heal them.
40.13.16.1^of you however blessed are the eyes, because they see;
40.13.16.2^and the ears of you, because they hear.
40.13.17.1^truly for i say to you, that many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see, and not saw;
40.13.17.2^and to hear what you hear, and not heard.
40.13.18.1^you therefore hear the parable of the one having sown:
40.13.19.1^everyone hearing the word of the kingdom and not understanding, comes the evil one and snatches away that having been sown in the heart of him.
40.13.19.2^this is the one on the path having been sown.
40.13.20.1^that which now upon the rocky places having been sown, this is the one the word hearing, and immediately with joy receiving it;
40.13.21.1^no he has now root in himself, but temporary is;
40.13.21.2^having come however tribulation or persecution on account of the word, immediately he falls away.
40.13.22.1^that which now among the thorns having been sown, this is the one the word hearing, and the care - the present age and the deceit - of riches choke the word, and unfruitful it becomes.
40.13.23.1^that however on the good soil having been sown, this is the one the word hearing and understanding, who indeed brings forth fruit and produces   some indeed a hundredfold, some now sixty, some now thirty.
40.13.24.1^another parable put he before them, saying, has become like the kingdom of the heavens, a man having sown good seed in the field of him.
40.13.25.1^in now the time are sleeping the men, came his - enemy and sowed weeds in the midst of the wheat, and went away.
40.13.26.1^when now sprouted the plants and fruit produced, then appeared also the weeds.
40.13.27.1^having come to him now, the servants the master of the house said to him, sir, not good seed did you sow in - your field?
40.13.27.2^how then has it the weeds?
40.13.28.1^- and he said to them, an enemy, a man this did.
40.13.28.2^- and the servants said, to him do you desire then that having gone forth, we should gather them?
40.13.29.1^- and he said, no;
40.13.29.2^not lest gathering the weeds, you would uproot with them the wheat.
40.13.30.1^allow to grow together both until the harvest;
40.13.30.2^and in the time of the harvest i will say to the harvesters, gather first the weeds, and bind them into bundles in order - to burn them;
40.13.30.3^- and the wheat, gather together into the barn of me.
40.13.31.1^another parable put he before them, saying, like is the kingdom of the heavens to a grain of mustard, which having taken, a man sowed in the field of him;
40.13.32.1^which smallest indeed is of all the seeds;
40.13.32.2^when however it is grown, greater than the garden plants it is, and becomes a tree, so that come the birds of the air and perch in the branches of it.
40.13.33.1^another parable spoke he to them:
40.13.33.2^like is the kingdom of the heavens to leaven, which having taken, a woman hid in of flour measures three, until of it was leavened all.
40.13.34.1^these things all spoke - jesus in parables to the crowds, and without a parable not he was speaking to them,
40.13.35.1^so that might be fulfilled that having been spoken by the prophet, saying, i will open in parables the mouth of me;
40.13.35.2^i will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.
40.13.36.1^then having dismissed the crowds, he went into the house.
40.13.36.2^and came to him the disciples of him, saying, explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.
40.13.37.1^- and answering he said, the one sowing the good seed is the son - of man;
40.13.38.1^- and the field is the world;
40.13.38.2^- and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom;
40.13.38.3^- and the weeds are the sons of the evil one;
40.13.39.1^- and the enemy - having sown them is the devil;
40.13.39.2^- and the harvest the consummation of the age is, - and the harvesters angels are.
40.13.40.1^as therefore is gathered the weeds, and in fire is consumed, thus it will be in the consummation of the age.
40.13.41.1^will send forth the son - of man the angels of him, and they will gather out of the kingdom of him all the causes of sin and those practicing - lawlessness,
40.13.42.1^and they will cast them into the furnace of the fire;
40.13.42.2^there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
40.13.43.1^then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of the father of them.
40.13.43.2^the one having ears, let him hear!
40.13.44.1^like is the kingdom of the heavens treasure having been hidden in the field, which, having found, a man hid, and for the joy of it goes and he sells all that he has and buys the field that.
40.13.45.1^again like is the kingdom of the heavens a man, a merchant seeking fine pearls;
40.13.46.1^having found now one very precious pearl, having gone away, he has sold all things as many as he had, and bought it.
40.13.47.1^again like is the kingdom of the heavens a dragnet having been cast into the sea, and of every kind having gathered together,
40.13.48.1^which, when it was filled, having drawn up on the shore and having sat down, they collected the good into vessels, the and bad out they cast.
40.13.49.1^thus will it be in the consummation of the age;
40.13.49.2^will go out the angels, and will separate the evil from the midst of the righteous,
40.13.50.1^and will cast them into the furnace of the fire.
40.13.50.2^there will be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.
40.13.51.1^have you understood these things all?
40.13.51.2^they say to him, yes.
40.13.52.1^- and he said to them, because of this, every scribe having been discipled into the kingdom of the heavens like is a man, a master of a house, who puts forth out of the treasure of him things new and old.
40.13.53.1^and it came to pass, when had finished - jesus the parables these, he withdrew from there.
40.13.54.1^and having come into the region his own, he was teaching them in the synagogue of them, so that are astonished they and are saying, from where to this man the wisdom this and the miraculous powers?
40.13.55.1^not this is the of the carpenter son?
40.13.55.2^is not the mother of him called mary?
40.13.55.3^and the brothers of him james and joseph and simon and judas?
40.13.56.1^and the sisters of him not all with us are?
40.13.56.2^from where then to this man these things all?
40.13.57.1^and they were offended at him.
40.13.57.2^- but jesus said to them, not is a prophet without honor, if not in the hometown, and in the household of him.
40.13.58.1^and not he did there miracles many, because of the unbelief of them.
40.14.1.1^at that - time heard herod the tetrarch the news of jesus,
40.14.2.1^and he said to the servants of him, this is john the baptist;
40.14.2.2^he is risen from the dead, and because of this, the miraculous powers are working in him.
40.14.3.1^- for herod having seized - john, he bound him and in prison put him, on account of herodias, the wife of philip, the brother of him.
40.14.4.1^had been saying for - john to him, not it is lawful for you to have her.
40.14.5.1^although wishing him to kill, he feared the multitude, because as a prophet him they were holding.
40.14.6.1^the birthday now having been celebrated - of herod, danced the daughter - of herodias in the midst, and pleased - herod,
40.14.7.1^whereupon with oath he promised to her to give whatever if she should ask.
40.14.8.1^- and having been urged on by the mother of her, give me, she says, here upon a platter the head of john the baptist.
40.14.9.1^and having been grieved the king, on account of the oaths and those reclining with him, he commanded it to be given.
40.14.10.1^and he having sent, beheaded - john in the prison.
40.14.11.1^and was brought the head of him on a platter, and was given to the girl, and she brought it to the mother of her.
40.14.12.1^and having come, the disciples of him took the body, and buried it;
40.14.12.2^and having come, they told - jesus.
40.14.13.1^having heard now, - jesus withdrew from there by boat to a secluded place apart himself.
40.14.13.2^and having heard of it, the crowds followed him on foot from the towns.
40.14.14.1^and having gone out, he saw great a crowd, and was moved with compassion toward them, and healed the sick of them.
40.14.15.1^evening now having come, came to him the disciples, saying, desolate is this place, and the time already is gone by.
40.14.15.2^dismiss the crowds, that having gone into the villages, they might buy for themselves food.
40.14.16.1^- and jesus said to them, no need they have to go away.
40.14.16.2^give to them you to eat.
40.14.17.1^- and they say to him, not we have here, if not five loaves and two fish.
40.14.18.1^- and he said, bring to me here them.
40.14.19.1^and having commanded the crowds to sit down on the grass, having taken the five loaves and the two fish, having looked up to - heaven, he spoke a blessing;
40.14.19.2^and having broken, he gave to the disciples the loaves, - and the disciples to the crowds.
40.14.20.1^and ate all and were satisfied;
40.14.20.2^and they took up that being over and above of the fragments, twelve hand-baskets full.
40.14.21.1^those then eating were men about five thousand, besides women and children.
40.14.22.1^and immediately he compelled the disciples to enter into the boat and to go before him to the other side, until that he would have dismissed the crowds.
40.14.23.1^and having dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray.
40.14.23.2^evening now having arrived, alone he was there.
40.14.24.1^- and the boat, now stadia many from the land, being tossed by the waves was, for contrary was the wind.
40.14.25.1^in the fourth now watch of the night, he went to them, walking on the sea.
40.14.26.1^- and the disciples, having seen him on the sea walking, were troubled, saying -, a ghost it is!
40.14.26.2^and in - fear they cried out.
40.14.27.1^immediately now spoke - jesus to them, saying, take courage!
40.14.27.2^i it is, not fear.
40.14.28.1^answering now to him, - peter said, lord, if you it is, command me to come to you upon the waters.
40.14.29.1^- and he said, come.
40.14.29.2^and having descended from the boat, - peter walked upon the water and came to - jesus.
40.14.30.1^seeing now the wind charging, he was afraid, and having begun to sink, he cried out, saying, lord, save me!
40.14.31.1^immediately now - jesus, having stretched out the hand, took hold of him and says to him, you of little faith, of why did you doubt?
40.14.32.1^and having entered they into the boat, ceased the wind.
40.14.33.1^those then in the boat worshiped him, saying, truly, of god son you are!
40.14.34.1^and having crossed over, they came to the land of gennesaret.
40.14.35.1^and having recognized him, the men the place of that sent to all the surrounding region that and brought to him all those sick being,
40.14.36.1^and they were begging him that only they might touch the fringe of the garment of him;
40.14.36.2^and as many as touched were cured.
40.15.1.1^then come - to jesus from jerusalem pharisees and scribes, saying,
40.15.2.1^because of why the disciples of you break the tradition of the elders?
40.15.2.2^not for they wash the hands of them when bread they shall eat.
40.15.3.1^- and answering he said to them, because of why also you break the commandment - of god on account of the tradition of you?
40.15.4.1^- for god commanded, honor the father and the mother  and, the one speaking evil of father or mother, in death must end.
40.15.5.1^you however say, whoever - shall say to the father or the mother, it is a gift, whatever if by me you might be profited,
40.15.6.1^no not he shall honor the father of himself.
40.15.6.2^and you made void the commandment - of god on account of the tradition of you!
40.15.7.1^hypocrites!
40.15.7.2^rightly prophesied concerning you isaiah, saying,
40.15.8.1^the people this, with the lips me it honors;
40.15.8.2^the however heart of them, far away is kept from me;
40.15.9.1^in vain then they worship me, teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.
40.15.10.1^and having called to him the crowd, he said to them, hear and understand!
40.15.11.1^not what is entering into the mouth defiles the man;
40.15.11.2^but that going forth out of the mouth, this defiles the man.
40.15.12.1^then having come near, the disciples said to him, know you that the pharisees, having heard the saying, were offended?
40.15.13.1^- and answering he said, every plant that not has planted the father of me - heavenly, it will be rooted up.
40.15.14.1^leave them!
40.15.14.2^blind they are guides of the blind.
40.15.14.3^blind now blind if they lead, both into a pit will fall.
40.15.15.1^answering then, - peter said to him, explain to us the parable this.
40.15.16.1^- and he said, still also you without understanding are?
40.15.17.1^not yet understand you that everything - entering into the mouth, into the stomach goes, and into the sewer is cast out?
40.15.18.1^the things however going forth out of the mouth, out of the heart come forth, and these defile the man.
40.15.19.1^out of for the heart come forth thoughts evil, murders, adulteries, sexual immorality, thefts, false testimonies, slanders.
40.15.20.1^these are the things defiling the man;
40.15.20.2^- but with unwashed hands to eat, not defiles the man.
40.15.21.1^and having gone forth from there, - jesus withdrew to the district of tyre and sidon.
40.15.22.1^and behold, a woman canaanite from the region same, having approached, was crying out, saying, have mercy on me, lord, son of david;
40.15.22.2^the daughter of me miserably is possessed by a demon.
40.15.23.1^- and not he answered her a word.
40.15.23.2^and having come to him, the disciples of him were imploring him, saying, dismiss her, for she cries out after us!
40.15.24.1^- and answering he said, not i was sent, if not to the sheep - being lost of the house of israel.
40.15.25.1^- and having come, she was worshiping him, saying, lord, help me!
40.15.26.1^- and answering, he said, not it is right to take the bread of the children, and to cast it to the dogs.
40.15.27.1^- and she said, yes, lord;
40.15.27.2^even however the dogs eat of the crumbs - falling from the table of the masters of them.
40.15.28.1^then answering, - jesus said to her, o woman, great is of you the faith!
40.15.28.2^be it to you as you desire.
40.15.28.3^and was healed the daughter of her from the hour that.
40.15.29.1^and having departed from there, - jesus went along the sea - of galilee;
40.15.29.2^and having gone up on the mountain, he was sitting there.
40.15.30.1^and came to him crowds great, having with them lame, blind, crippled, mute, and others many, and they placed them at the feet of him, and he healed them;
40.15.31.1^so that the crowd marveled, seeing mute speaking, crippled restored, and lame walking, and blind seeing;
40.15.31.2^and they glorified the god of israel.
40.15.32.1^- and jesus, having called to him the disciples of him, said, i am moved with compassion toward the crowd, because already days three they continue with me, and nothing have that they might eat;
40.15.32.2^and to send away them hungry, not i am willing, not lest they faint on the way.
40.15.33.1^and say to him the disciples, from where to us in a secluded place, loaves so many as to satisfy a crowd so great.
40.15.34.1^and says to them - jesus, how many loaves have you?
40.15.34.2^- and they said, seven, and a few small fish.
40.15.35.1^and he having commanded the crowds to sit down on the ground,
40.15.36.1^having taken the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks, he broke them and was giving to disciples, - and the disciples to the crowd.
40.15.37.1^and ate all and were satisfied;
40.15.37.2^and that being over and above of the fragments, they took up seven baskets full.
40.15.38.1^those then eating were four thousand men, besides women and children.
40.15.39.1^and having dismissed the crowds, he entered into the boat and came to the region of magadan.
40.16.1.1^and having approached, the pharisees and sadducees, testing , asked him a sign out of - heaven to show them.
40.16.2.1^- and answering he said to them, evening having come, you say, fair weather;
40.16.2.2^is red for the sky.
40.16.3.1^and in the morning, today a storm;
40.16.3.2^is red for being overcast the sky.
40.16.3.3^the indeed appearance of the sky you know how to discern, - but the signs of the times, not you are able!
40.16.4.1^a generation evil and adulterous, a sign seeks, and a sign not will be given to it, if not the sign of jonah.
40.16.4.2^and having left them, he went away.
40.16.5.1^and having come the disciples to the other side, they forgot bread to take.
40.16.6.1^- and jesus said to them, watch and beware of the leaven of the pharisees and sadducees.
40.16.7.1^- and they were reasoning among themselves, saying, because bread not we took.
40.16.8.1^having known this however, - jesus said, why reason you among yourselves, o you of little faith, because bread not you took?
40.16.9.1^not yet do you understand, nor remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many hand-baskets you gathered?
40.16.10.1^nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?
40.16.11.1^how not understand you that, not concerning bread i spoke to you, to beware also of the leaven of the pharisees and sadducees?
40.16.12.1^then they understood that not he said to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the pharisees and sadducees.
40.16.13.1^having come then - jesus into the district of caesarea - philippi, he was questioning the disciples of him, saying, whom do pronounce - men to be the son of man?
40.16.14.1^- and they said, some indeed john the baptist;
40.16.14.2^others now elijah;
40.16.14.3^others now jeremiah, or one of the prophets.
40.16.15.1^he says to them, you but whom me do you pronounce to be?
40.16.16.1^answering now, simon peter said, you are the christ, the son of god the living.
40.16.17.1^answering now, - jesus said to him, blessed are you, simon barjona!
40.16.17.2^for flesh and blood not revealed it to you, but the father of me, who is in the heavens.
40.16.18.1^i also now to you say that you are peter, and on this the rock i will build my - church, and the gates of hades not will prevail against it.
40.16.19.1^i will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens;
40.16.19.2^and whatever if you might bind on the earth, will be bound in the heavens;
40.16.19.3^and whatever if you might loose on the earth, will be loosed in the heavens.
40.16.20.1^then instructed he the disciples that to no one they should say that he is the christ.
40.16.21.1^from that time began - jesus to show to the disciples of him that it is necessary for him to jerusalem to go away, and many things to suffer from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be killed, and on the third day to be raised.
40.16.22.1^and having taken aside him, - peter began to rebuke him, saying, far be it from you, lord;
40.16.22.2^never, not will be to you this.
40.16.23.1^- and having turned he said - to peter, get behind me, satan!
40.16.23.2^a stumbling block you are to me.
40.16.23.3^for not your thoughts are of the things - of god, but the things of men.
40.16.24.1^then - jesus said to disciples of him, if anyone desires after me to come, let him deny himself, and take up the cross of him, and follow me.
40.16.25.1^whoever for if might desire the life of him to save, will lose it;
40.16.25.2^whoever however - might lose the life of him on account of me, will find it.
40.16.26.1^what for will it profit a man, if the world whole he gains, - but the soul of him loses?
40.16.26.2^or what will give a man as an exchange for the soul of him?
40.16.27.1^is about for the son of the man to come in the glory the father of him, with the angels of him;
40.16.27.2^and then he will give to each according to the deeds of him.
40.16.28.1^truly i say to you -, there are some of those here standing who no not shall taste of death until - they have seen the son - of man coming in the kingdom of him.
40.17.1.1^and after days six, takes with him - jesus, - peter and james and john, the brother of him, and brings up them into a mountain high by themselves.
40.17.2.1^and he was transfigured before them, and shone the face of him like the sun, - and the clothes of him became white as the light.
40.17.3.1^and behold, appeared to them moses and elijah, talking with him.
40.17.4.1^answering now, - peter said - to jesus, lord, good it is for us here to be.
40.17.4.2^if you wish, i will make here three tabernacles, for you one, and for moses one, and for elijah one.
40.17.5.1^while yet he was speaking, behold, a cloud bright overshadowed them;
40.17.5.2^and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, this is the son of me, the beloved, in whom i am well pleased.
40.17.5.3^listen to him!
40.17.6.1^and having heard it, the disciples fell upon face of them and were terrified greatly.
40.17.7.1^and having come to them - jesus, and having touched them, he said, rise up, and not be afraid.
40.17.8.1^having lifted up and the eyes of them, no one they saw if not himself jesus alone.
40.17.9.1^and as were descending they from the mountain, instructed them - jesus, saying, to no one tell the vision, until that the son - of man out from the dead is risen.
40.17.10.1^and asked him the disciples, saying, why then the scribes say that elijah it behooves to come first?
40.17.11.1^- and answering, he said, elijah indeed comes, and will restore all things.
40.17.12.1^i say however to you that elijah already is come, and not they knew him, but did to him whatever they desired.
40.17.12.2^thus also, the son - of man is about to suffer from them.
40.17.13.1^then understood the disciples that concerning john the baptist he spoke to them.
40.17.14.1^and they having come to the crowd, came to him a man kneeling down to him
40.17.15.1^and saying, lord, have mercy on my - son, for he is epileptic and miserably suffers;
40.17.15.2^often for he falls into the fire, and often into the water.
40.17.16.1^and i brought him to the disciples of you, and not they were able him to heal.
40.17.17.1^answering now, - jesus said, o generation unbelieving and perverted, how long when with you will i be?
40.17.17.2^how long when will i bear with you?
40.17.17.3^bring to me him here.
40.17.18.1^and rebuked him - jesus, and went out from him the demon, and was healed the boy from the hour that.
40.17.19.1^then having come the disciples - to jesus in private, they said, because of why we not were able to cast out it?
40.17.20.1^- and he said to them, because of the little faith of you.
40.17.20.2^truly for i say to you, if you have faith as a seed of mustard, you will say to the mountain to this, move from here to there, and it will move.
40.17.20.3^and nothing will be impossible for you.
40.17.22.1^were abiding now they in - galilee, said to them - jesus, is about the son - of man to be betrayed into the hands of men,
40.17.23.1^and they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised up.
40.17.23.2^and they were grieved deeply.
40.17.24.1^having come now they to capernaum, came those the didrachmas collecting - to peter and said, the teacher of you not does he pay the didrachmas?
40.17.25.1^he says, yes.
40.17.25.2^and he having entered into the house, anticipated him - jesus, saying, what you do think, simon?
40.17.25.3^the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive custom or tribute?
40.17.25.4^from the sons of them, or from - strangers?
40.17.26.1^he having said now, from the strangers, said to him - jesus, - then free are the sons.
40.17.27.1^that however not we might offend them, having gone to sea, cast a hook, and the having come up first fish take, and having opened the mouth of it, you will find a four-drachma coin.
40.17.27.2^that having taken, give to them for me and yourself.
40.18.1.1^in that - hour came the disciples - to jesus, saying, who then the greatest is in the kingdom of the heavens?
40.18.2.1^and having called to him a child, he set it in midst of them,
40.18.3.1^and said, truly i say to you, if not you turn and become as the little children, no not shall you enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
40.18.4.1^whoever therefore will humble himself as the little child this, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens.
40.18.5.1^and whoever if shall receive one little child such in the name of me, me receives.
40.18.6.1^whoever then - shall cause to stumble one of the little ones of these - believing in me, it is better for him that should be hung a millstone heavy around the neck of him, and he be sunk in the depth of the sea.
40.18.7.1^woe to the world because of the causes of sin.
40.18.7.2^necessary are for to come the stumbling blocks, but woe to the man by whom the offense comes!
40.18.8.1^if now the hand of you or the foot of you causes to sin you, cut off it and cast it from you;
40.18.8.2^better for you it is to enter into - life crippled or lame, than two hands or two feet having, to be cast into the fire - eternal.
40.18.9.1^and if the eye of you causes to sin you, gouge out it and cast it from you;
40.18.9.2^better for you it is one-eyed into - life to enter, than two eyes having to be cast into the hell of the fire.
40.18.10.1^see that not you despise one of the little ones of these.
40.18.10.2^i say for to you that the angels of them in the heavens continually always behold the face of the father of me, who is in the heavens.
40.18.12.1^what you do think?
40.18.12.2^if there should be to any man a hundred sheep, and has gone astray one of them, not will he leave the ninety nine on the mountains, and having gone, seek the one going astray?
40.18.13.1^and if he should find it, truly i say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety nine - not having gone astray.
40.18.14.1^thus not it is the will of the father of you who is in the heavens, that should perish one of the little ones of these.
40.18.15.1^if now sins against you the brother of you, go reprove him, between you and him alone.
40.18.15.2^if you he will hear, you have gained the brother of you.
40.18.16.1^if however not he will hear, take with you more, one or two, that upon the testimony of two witnesses or of three, may be strengthened every word.
40.18.17.1^if now he fails to listen to them, tell it to the church.
40.18.17.2^if now also to the church he fails to listen, let him be to you as the pagan and the tax collector.
40.18.18.1^truly i say to you, how many if you shall bind on the earth, shall have been bound in heaven;
40.18.18.2^and how many if you shall loose on the earth, shall have been loosed in heaven.
40.18.19.1^again truly i say to you that if two might agree of you on the earth concerning any matter, that if they shall ask, it will be done for them by the father of me who is in the heavens.
40.18.20.1^where for are two or three gathered together unto - my name, there am i in the midst of them.
40.18.21.1^then having come, - peter said to him, lord, how often will sin against me the brother of me, and i will forgive him?
40.18.21.2^up to seven times?
40.18.22.1^says to him - jesus, not i say to you up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven!
40.18.23.1^because of this, has become like the kingdom of the heavens to a man, a king, who desired to settle accounts with the servants of him.
40.18.24.1^having begun then he to settle, was brought to him, one a debtor of ten thousand talents.
40.18.25.1^nothing having now he to pay, commanded him the master to be sold, and the wife and the children, and all as many as he had, and payment to be made.
40.18.26.1^having fallen down therefore the servant was bowing on his knees to him, saying, have patience with me, and all i will pay to you.
40.18.27.1^having been moved with compassion now, the master of the servant that released him, and the debt forgave him.
40.18.28.1^having gone out however, the servant same found one the fellow servants of him who was owing him a hundred denarii, and having seized him he was throttling him, saying, pay if any you owe.
40.18.29.1^having fallen down therefore, the fellow servant of him was begging him, saying, have patience with me, and i will pay you.
40.18.30.1^- but not he was willing, rather having gone, he cast him into prison, until he should pay that which was owing.
40.18.31.1^having seen therefore the fellow servants of him the things having taken place, they were grieved deeply, and having gone, narrated to master of themselves all that having taken place.
40.18.32.1^then having called to him, the master of him says to him, servant evil, all the debt that i forgave you, because you begged me.
40.18.33.1^not did it behoove also you to have pitied the fellow servant of you, as also i you had pitied?
40.18.34.1^and having been angry, the master of him delivered him to the jailers, until that he should pay all - being owed.
40.18.35.1^thus also the father of me - heavenly will do to you, if not you forgive each the brother of him, from the heart of you.
40.19.1.1^and it came to pass, when had finished - jesus the words these, he withdrew from - galilee and came to the region - of judea beyond the jordan.
40.19.2.1^and followed him crowds great, and he healed them there.
40.19.3.1^and came to him pharisees, testing him and saying, if is it lawful for a man to divorce the a wife to him for every cause?
40.19.4.1^which now answering, he said, not have you read that the one having created, from the beginning male and female made them
40.19.5.1^and said, on account of this will leave a man the father and the mother and be joined with the wife of him, and will become the two into flesh one
40.19.6.1^so that no longer are they two, but flesh one.
40.19.6.2^what therefore - god united together, man not let separate.
40.19.7.1^they say to him, why then moses did command to give a roll of divorce, and to send away her?
40.19.8.1^he says to them -, moses in view of the hardness of heart of you allowed you to divorce the wives of you;
40.19.8.2^from the beginning however not was it this way.
40.19.9.1^i say now to you that whoever - shall divorce - wife of him except for sexual immorality, and shall marry another, commits adultery.
40.19.10.1^say to him the disciples of him if this is the case of the man with the wife, not it is better to marry.
40.19.11.1^- and he said to them, not all receive the word this, but only those to whom it has been given.
40.19.12.1^there are for eunuchs who from the womb of their mother were born thus, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by - men, and there are eunuchs who made eunuchs of themselves for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens.
40.19.12.2^the one being able to receive it, let him receive it.
40.19.13.1^then were brought to him little children, that the hands he might lay on them, and he might pray.
40.19.13.2^- however the disciples rebuked them.
40.19.14.1^- and jesus said, permit the little children, and not do forbid them to come to me;
40.19.14.2^of the for such kind is the kingdom of the heavens.
40.19.15.1^and having laid the hands upon them, he departed from there.
40.19.16.1^and behold, one having come to him, said, teacher, what good thing shall i do, that i might have life eternal?
40.19.17.1^- and he said to him, why me ask you about what is good?
40.19.17.2^only one is - good.
40.19.17.3^if however you desire into - life to enter, keep the commandments.
40.19.18.1^he says to him, which?
40.19.18.2^- and jesus said, - not shall you murder, not shall you commit adultery, not shall you steal, not shall you bear false witness,
40.19.19.1^you shall honor the father and the mother, and you shall love - neighbor of you as yourself.
40.19.20.1^says to him the young man, all these things i have kept.
40.19.20.2^what yet lack i?
40.19.21.1^was saying to him - jesus, if you desire perfect to be, go, sell of you the possessing, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens;
40.19.21.2^and come, follow me.
40.19.22.1^having heard now the young man the statement, he went away grieving;
40.19.22.2^he was one for having possessions many.
40.19.23.1^- and jesus said to the disciples of him, truly i say to you that a rich man with difficulty will enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
40.19.24.1^again now i say to you, easier for it is a camel through the eye of a needle to go, than a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god.
40.19.25.1^having heard now, the disciples were astonished exceedingly, saying, who then is able to be saved?
40.19.26.1^having looked on them now, - jesus said to them, with men this impossible is, with however god all things are possible.
40.19.27.1^then answering - peter said to him, behold, we left all things and followed you;
40.19.27.2^what then will be to us?
40.19.28.1^- and jesus said to them, truly i say to you that you - having followed me, in the regeneration, when shall sit down the son - of man upon the throne of glory of him, will sit also you on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes - of israel.
40.19.29.1^and everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for the sake of - name, my a hundredfold will receive, and life eternal will inherit.
40.19.30.1^many however will be first last, and last first.
40.20.1.1^like for is the kingdom of the heavens to a man, a master of a house, who went out in the morning to hire workmen for the vineyard of him.
40.20.2.1^having agreed then with the workmen for a denarius for the day, he sent them into the vineyard of him.
40.20.3.1^and having gone out about the third hour, he saw others standing in the marketplace idle,
40.20.4.1^and to them he said, go also you into the vineyard, and whatever if might be right, i will give you.
40.20.5.1^- and they went.
40.20.5.2^again then having gone out about the sixth and ninth hour, he did likewise.
40.20.6.1^about then the eleventh, having gone out, he found others standing, and he says to them, why here stand you all the day idle?
40.20.7.1^they say to him, because no one us has hired.
40.20.7.2^he says to them, go also you into the vineyard.
40.20.8.1^evening then having arrived, says the master of the vineyard to foreman of him, call the workmen and pay them the wages, having begun from the last unto the first.
40.20.9.1^and having come those hired about the eleventh hour, they received each a denarius.
40.20.10.1^and having come the first, they thought that more they will receive, but they received those each a denarius also themselves.
40.20.11.1^having received, now they were grumbling against the master of the house,
40.20.12.1^saying, these the last, one hour have worked, and equal to us them you have made, those having borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.
40.20.13.1^- and answering to one of them, he said, friend, not i do wrong you.
40.20.13.2^not for a denarius did you agree with me?
40.20.14.1^take what is yours and go.
40.20.14.2^i desire now to this - last to give, as also to you.
40.20.15.1^or not is it lawful for me what i will to do with that which is mine?
40.20.15.2^or the eye of you envious is, because i generous am?
40.20.16.1^thus will be the last first, and the first, last.
40.20.17.1^and going up - jesus to jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside themselves, and on the way he said to them,
40.20.18.1^behold, we go up to jerusalem, and the son - of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death,
40.20.19.1^and they will betray him the gentiles unto, - to mock and to flog and to crucify;
40.20.19.2^and the third day he will rise again.
40.20.20.1^then came to him the mother of the sons of zebedee with the sons of her, kneeling down, and asking something from him.
40.20.21.1^- and he said to her, what do you desire?
40.20.21.2^she says to him, say that might sit these - two sons of mine, one on the right hand of you and one on the left hand of you, in the kingdom of you.
40.20.22.1^answering now, - jesus said, not you know what you ask for.
40.20.22.2^are you able to drink the cup which i am about to drink?
40.20.22.3^they say to him, we are able.
40.20.23.1^he says to them, - indeed the cup of me you will drink, - but to sit on the right hand of me and on the left, not is mine this to give, but to those for whom it has been prepared by the father of me.
40.20.24.1^and having heard this, the ten were indignant about the two brothers.
40.20.25.1^- and jesus, having called to him them, said, you know that the rulers of the gentiles exercise lordship over them, and the great ones exercise authority over them.
40.20.26.1^not thus will it be among you;
40.20.26.2^but whoever if wishes among you great to become, he will be your servant;
40.20.27.1^and whoever - wishes among you to be first, he will be your slave;
40.20.28.1^even as the son - of man not came to be served, but to serve, and to give the life of him as a ransom for many.
40.20.29.1^and as were going out they from jericho, followed him a crowd great.
40.20.30.1^and behold, two blind men sitting beside the road, having heard that jesus is passing by, cried out, saying, have mercy on us, lord, son of david.
40.20.31.1^- and the crowd rebuked them, that they should be silent.
40.20.31.2^- but all the more they cried out, saying, have mercy on us, lord, son of david.
40.20.32.1^and having stopped, - jesus called them and said, what do you desire i should do unto you?
40.20.33.1^they say to him, lord, that might be opened the eyes of us.
40.20.34.1^having been moved with compassion then, - jesus touched the eyes of them;
40.20.34.2^and immediately they received sight, and they followed him.
40.21.1.1^and when they drew near to jerusalem and came to bethphage on the mount - of olives, then jesus sent two disciples,
40.21.2.1^saying to them, go into the village - in front of you, and immediately you will find a donkey having been tied, and a colt with her;
40.21.2.2^having untied them, bring them to me.
40.21.3.1^and if anyone to you says anything, you will say that the lord of them need has.
40.21.3.2^immediately then he will send them.
40.21.4.1^this then came to pass that it might be fulfilled that having been spoken by the prophet, saying,
40.21.5.1^say to the daughter of zion, behold, the king of you comes to you, gentle and mounted on a donkey, even upon a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.
40.21.6.1^having gone then the disciples and having done as commanded them - jesus,
40.21.7.1^they brought the donkey and the colt, and put upon them their cloaks, and he sat on them.
40.21.8.1^the now very great crowd spread their the cloaks on the road;
40.21.8.2^others now were cutting down branches from the trees and were spreading them on the road.
40.21.9.1^the now crowds - going before him and those following were crying out, saying:
40.21.9.2^hosanna to the son of david!
40.21.9.3^blessed is the one coming in the name of the lord!
40.21.9.4^hosanna in the highest!
40.21.10.1^and having entered of him into jerusalem, was stirred all the city, saying, who is this?
40.21.11.1^- and the crowds were saying, this is the prophet, jesus, the one from nazareth - of galilee.
40.21.12.1^and entered jesus into the temple and cast out all those selling and buying in the temple, and the tables of the money changers he overturned, and the seats of those selling the doves.
40.21.13.1^and he says to them, it has been written:
40.21.13.2^the house of me a house of prayer will be called.
40.21.13.3^you however it have made a den of robbers.
40.21.14.1^and came to him blind and lame in the temple, and he healed them.
40.21.15.1^having seen now the chief priests and the scribes the wonders that he did and the children the crying out in the temple and saying, hosanna to the son of david, they were indignant
40.21.16.1^and said to him, hear you what these say?
40.21.16.2^- and jesus says to them, yes, never did you read -:
40.21.16.3^out of the mouth of babes and sucklings, you have prepared for yourself praise
40.21.17.1^and having left them, he went out of the city to bethany, and he passed the night there.
40.21.18.1^in the morning then, having come back into the city, he became hungry.
40.21.19.1^and having seen fig tree one along the road, he came to it and nothing found on it, if not leaves only.
40.21.19.2^and he says to it, no more from you fruit let there be, to the age.
40.21.19.3^and withered immediately the fig tree.
40.21.20.1^and having seen it, the disciples marveled, saying, how so quickly withered the fig tree?
40.21.21.1^answering now, - jesus said to them, truly i say to you, if you have faith and not do doubt, not only the miracle of the fig tree will you do, but even if to the mountain this you should say, be you taken away and be you cast into the sea, it will come to pass.
40.21.22.1^and all things as many as - you might ask in - prayer, believing, you will receive.
40.21.23.1^and having come of him into the temple, came to him teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people, saying, by what authority these things are you doing?
40.21.23.2^and who to you gave the authority this?
40.21.24.1^answering now, - jesus said to them, will ask you i also thing one, which if you tell me, i also to you will say by what authority these things i do.
40.21.25.1^the baptism of john, from where was it?
40.21.25.2^from heaven, or from men?
40.21.25.3^- and they were reasoning with themselves, saying, if we should say, from heaven, he will say to us, because of why then not did you believe him?
40.21.26.1^if however we should say, from men, we fear the multitude;
40.21.26.2^all for as a prophet hold - john.
40.21.27.1^and answering - jesus, they said, not do we know.
40.21.27.2^said to them also he, neither i tell you by what authority these things i do.
40.21.28.1^what however you think?
40.21.28.2^a man had sons two, and having come to the first he said, son, go today, work in the vineyard.
40.21.29.1^- and answering he said, not will i.
40.21.29.2^afterward however, having repented, he went.
40.21.30.1^having come then to the other, he said likewise.
40.21.30.2^- and answering he said, i will sir, and not did he go.
40.21.31.1^which of the two did the will of the father?
40.21.31.2^they say, the first.
40.21.31.3^says to them - jesus, truly i say to you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes go before you into the kingdom - of god.
40.21.32.1^came for john to you in the way of righteousness, and not you did believe him, - however the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him;
40.21.32.2^you then, having seen, not even did repent afterward - to believe him.
40.21.33.1^another parable hear:
40.21.33.2^a man there was, a master of a house, who planted a vineyard, and a fence it placed around, and dug in it a winepress, and built a tower, and rented out it to farmers, and traveled abroad.
40.21.34.1^when then drew near the season of the fruits, he sent the servants of him to the farmers to receive the fruits of him.
40.21.35.1^and having taken the farmers the servants of him, one - they beat, one then they killed, one then they stoned.
40.21.36.1^again he sent other servants, more than the first, and they did to them likewise.
40.21.37.1^afterward then, he sent to them the son of him, saying, they will respect the son of me.
40.21.38.1^- but the farmers having seen the son, said among themselves, this is the heir;
40.21.38.2^come, let us kill him and gain possession of the inheritance of him.
40.21.39.1^and having taking him, they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him.
40.21.40.1^when therefore shall come the master of the vineyard, what will he do the farmers to those?
40.21.41.1^they say to him, the wretches, grievously he will destroy them, and the vineyard he will rent out to other farmers, who will give to him the fruits in the seasons of them.
40.21.42.1^says to them - jesus, never did you read in the scriptures:
40.21.42.2^the stone which rejected those building, this has become the chief corner.
40.21.42.3^from the lord was this, and it is marvelous in the eyes of us?
40.21.43.1^because of this i say to you that will be taken away from you the kingdom - of god, and it will be given to a people producing the fruits of it.
40.21.44.1^and the one having fallen on the stone this will be broken;
40.21.44.2^on whomever but - it shall fall, it will grind to powder him.
40.21.45.1^and having heard the chief priests and the pharisees the parables of him, they knew that about them he speaks.
40.21.46.1^and seeking him to lay hold of, they feared the crowds, because as a prophet him they were holding.
40.22.1.1^and answering, - jesus again spoke in parables to them, saying,
40.22.2.1^has become like the kingdom of the heavens to a man, a king, who made a wedding feast for the son of him.
40.22.3.1^and he sent the servants of him to call those having been invited to the wedding feast, and not they were willing to come.
40.22.4.1^again he sent other servants, saying, say to those having been invited, behold, the dinner of me i have prepared, the oxen of me and the fatlings have been killed, and all things are ready;
40.22.4.2^come to the wedding feast.
40.22.5.1^- and having paid no attention they went away, one - to the own field, one then to the business of him.
40.22.6.1^- and the rest, having laid hold of the servants of him, mistreated and killed them.
40.22.7.1^- and the king was angry, and having sent the armies of him, he destroyed the murderers those, and the city of them he burned.
40.22.8.1^then he says to servants of him, the indeed wedding feast ready is;
40.22.8.2^those however having been invited not were worthy.
40.22.9.1^go therefore into the thoroughfares of the highways, and as many as if you shall find, invite to the wedding feast.
40.22.10.1^and having gone out the servants those into the highways, they brought together all as many as they found, evil both and good;
40.22.10.2^and became full the wedding hall of those reclining.
40.22.11.1^having entered in then the king to see those reclining, he beheld there a man not being dressed in clothes of wedding;
40.22.12.1^and he says to him, friend, how did you enter here not having garment of wedding?
40.22.12.2^- and he was speechless.
40.22.13.1^then the king said to the servants, having bound his feet and hands, cast out him into the darkness - outer;
40.22.13.2^there will be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.
40.22.14.1^many for are called, few however chosen.
40.22.15.1^then having gone out, the pharisees counsel took how him they might trap in his words.
40.22.16.1^and they send to him the disciples of them, with the herodians, saying, teacher, we know that true you are, and the way - of god in the truth you teach, and not there is care to you about no one, not for you look on the appearance of men.
40.22.17.1^tell therefore us what you think?
40.22.17.2^is it lawful to give tribute to caesar, or not?
40.22.18.1^having known however - jesus the malice of them, he said, why me do you test, hypocrites?
40.22.19.1^show me the coin of the tribute.
40.22.19.2^- and they presented to him a denarius.
40.22.20.1^and he says to them, whose is the likeness this?
40.22.20.2^and whose inscription?
40.22.21.1^they say to him caesar s.
40.22.21.2^then he says to them, give back therefore the things of caesar to caesar, and the things - of god - to god.
40.22.22.1^and having heard, they marveled;
40.22.22.2^and having left him, they went away.
40.22.23.1^on that - day came to him sadducees, those saying not there is a resurrection, and they questioned him,
40.22.24.1^saying, teacher, moses said, if anyone should die not having children, will marry the brother of him the wife of him, and he will raise up offspring for the brother of him.
40.22.25.1^there were now among us seven brothers;
40.22.25.2^and the first, having married, died, and not having seed, he left the wife of him to the brother of him.
40.22.26.1^likewise also the second, and the third, unto the seventh.
40.22.27.1^last then of all, died the woman.
40.22.28.1^in the resurrection, therefore, of which of the seven will she be wife?
40.22.28.2^all for had her.
40.22.29.1^answering now, - jesus said to them, you err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power - of god.
40.22.30.1^in for the resurrection, neither do they marry, nor are given in marriage, but like angels in - heaven they are.
40.22.31.1^concerning now the resurrection of the dead, not have you read that which has been spoken to you by - god, saying,
40.22.32.1^i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob?
40.22.32.2^not he is the god of the dead, but of the living.
40.22.33.1^and having heard, the crowds were astonished at the teaching of him.
40.22.34.1^- and the pharisees, having heard that he had silenced the sadducees, were gathered together the same.
40.22.35.1^and questioned him one of them, a lawyer, testing him,
40.22.36.1^teacher, which commandment is the greatest in the law?
40.22.37.1^- and he said to him, you shall love the lord the god of you with all the heart of you, and with all the soul of you, and with all the mind of you.
40.22.38.1^this is the great and first commandment.
40.22.39.1^the second also is like it:
40.22.39.2^you shall love the neighbor of you as yourself.
40.22.40.1^on these - two commandments, all the law hangs and the prophets.
40.22.41.1^having been assembled together now the pharisees, questioned them - jesus,
40.22.42.1^saying, what you think concerning the christ?
40.22.42.2^of whom son is he?
40.22.42.3^they say to him, - of david.
40.22.43.1^he says to them, how then, david in spirit does call him lord, saying:
40.22.44.1^said the lord to the lord of me, sit on the right hand of me, until - i place the enemies of you as a footstool for the feet of you.
40.22.45.1^if therefore david calls him lord, how son of him is he?
40.22.46.1^and no one was able to answer him a word, nor dared anyone from that - day to question him no longer.
40.23.1.1^then - jesus spoke to the crowds and to disciples of him,
40.23.2.1^saying, on - moses  seat have sat down the scribes and the pharisees.
40.23.3.1^all things therefore, how many if they might tell you, keep and observe.
40.23.3.2^after however the works of them, not do.
40.23.3.3^they speak for, and not act.
40.23.4.1^they tie up - burdens heavy and hard to bear and lay them on the shoulders - of men;
40.23.4.2^themselves however, with finger of them, not are they willing to move them.
40.23.5.1^all now the deeds of them, they do in order - to be seen - by men.
40.23.5.2^they broaden for the phylacteries of them, and enlarge their tassels.
40.23.6.1^they love now the chief place at the banquets, and the first seats in the synagogues,
40.23.7.1^and the greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called by - men, rabbi.
40.23.8.1^you however not shall be called rabbi;
40.23.8.2^one for is of you the teacher, all now you brothers are.
40.23.9.1^and father no one call of you on the earth;
40.23.9.2^one for is of you the father, who is in heaven.
40.23.10.1^neither be called instructors, since the instructor of you is one, the christ.
40.23.11.1^- and the greatest among you will be your servant.
40.23.12.1^he who then shall exalt himself will be humbled, and whoever shall humble himself will be exalted.
40.23.13.1^woe however to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites!
40.23.13.2^for you shut up the kingdom of the heavens before - men;
40.23.13.3^you for neither enter, nor even those who are entering do you allow to go in.
40.23.15.1^woe to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites!
40.23.15.2^for you traverse the sea and the dry land to make one convert, and when he has become so, you make him a son of hell twofold more than yourselves.
40.23.16.1^woe to you, guides blind, those saying, whoever - shall swear by the temple, nothing it is;
40.23.16.2^whoever however - shall swear by the gold of the temple is bound by his oath.
40.23.17.1^foolish and blind!
40.23.17.2^which for greater is, the gold, or the temple - having sanctified the gold?
40.23.18.1^and you say, whoever - shall swear by the altar, nothing it is;
40.23.18.2^whoever however - shall swear by the gift that is upon it, he is bound by his oath.
40.23.19.1^you blind men!
40.23.19.2^which for is greater, the gift, or the altar - sanctifying the gift?
40.23.20.1^the one therefore having sworn by the altar swears by it and by all things that are upon it.
40.23.21.1^and the one having sworn by the temple swears by it and by the one dwelling in it.
40.23.22.1^and the one having sworn by - heaven swears by the throne - of god and by the one sitting upon it.
40.23.23.1^woe to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites!
40.23.23.2^for you pay tithes of - mint, and - dill, and - cumin;
40.23.23.3^and you have neglected the weightier matters of the law:
40.23.23.4^- justice and - mercy and - faithfulness.
40.23.23.5^these now it behooved you to do, those not to be leaving aside.
40.23.24.1^guides blind!
40.23.24.2^those straining out the gnat, the however camel swallowing!
40.23.25.1^woe to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites!
40.23.25.2^for you cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish;
40.23.25.3^inside, however, they are full of greed and self-indulgence.
40.23.26.1^pharisee blind!
40.23.26.2^cleanse first the inside of the cup that might become also the outside of them clean.
40.23.27.1^woe to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites!
40.23.27.2^for you are like tombs having been whitewashed, which outwardly indeed appear beautiful.
40.23.27.3^inside however they are full of bones of the dead, and of all impurity.
40.23.28.1^thus also, you outwardly indeed appear - to men righteous, inwardly however you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
40.23.29.1^woe to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites!
40.23.29.2^for you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous;
40.23.30.1^and you say, if we had lived in the days of the fathers of us, not - we would have been with them partakers in the blood of the prophets.
40.23.31.1^thus you bear witness to yourselves that sons you are of those having murdered the prophets.
40.23.32.1^and you, fill up the measure of the fathers of you.
40.23.33.1^serpents!
40.23.33.2^offspring of vipers!
40.23.33.3^how shall you escape from the sentence - of hell?
40.23.34.1^because of this, behold, i send to you prophets and wise men and scribes.
40.23.34.2^some of them you will kill and will crucify, and some of them you will flog in the synagogues of you, and will persecute from town to town;
40.23.35.1^so that shall come upon you all the blood righteous being poured out upon the earth, from the blood of abel the righteous, to the blood of zechariah son of berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
40.23.36.1^truly i say to you, will come these things all upon the generation this.
40.23.37.1^jerusalem, jerusalem, - killing the prophets and stoning those having been sent to her!
40.23.37.2^how often would i have gathered together the children of you, in which way a hen gathers together the chicks of her under the wings, and not you were willing!
40.23.38.1^behold, is left to you the house of you desolate!
40.23.39.1^i say for to you, no not me shall you see from now until - you say, blessed is the one coming in the name of the lord.
40.24.1.1^and having gone forth - jesus from the temple, he was going away, and came to him the disciples of him to point out to him the buildings of the temple.
40.24.2.1^- and answering, he said to them, not do you see these things all?
40.24.2.2^truly i say to you, none not even shall be left here stone upon stone, which not will be thrown down.
40.24.3.1^as was sitting now he upon the mount - of olives, came to him the disciples in private, saying, tell us, when these things will be?
40.24.3.2^and what is the sign - of your coming and of the consummation of the age?
40.24.4.1^and answering, - jesus said to them, take heed, lest anyone you mislead.
40.24.5.1^many for will come in the name of me, saying, i am the christ, and many they will mislead.
40.24.6.1^you will begin then to hear of wars and rumors of wars.
40.24.6.2^behold, not be alarmed;
40.24.6.3^it is necessary for to take place, but not yet is the end.
40.24.7.1^will rise up for nation against nation, and kingdom against kingdom;
40.24.7.2^and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
40.24.8.1^all then these are the beginning of birth pains.
40.24.9.1^then will they deliver you to tribulation, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations on account of the name of me.
40.24.10.1^and then will fall away many, and one another they will betray, and will hate one another;
40.24.11.1^and many false prophets will arise and will mislead many.
40.24.12.1^and because - is to be multiplied - lawlessness, will grow cold the love of the many.
40.24.13.1^the one however having endured to the end, he will be saved.
40.24.14.1^and there will be proclaimed this - gospel of the kingdom in all the earth, for a testimony to all the nations;
40.24.14.2^and then will come the end.
40.24.15.1^when therefore you shall see the abomination - of desolation,  - having been spoken of by daniel the prophet, standing in the place holy   the one reading let him understand
40.24.16.1^then those in - judea, let them flee to the mountains;
40.24.17.1^the one on the housetop, not let him come down to take anything out of the house of him;
40.24.18.1^and the one in the field, neither let him return back to take the cloak of him.
40.24.19.1^woe then to those in womb having, and to the ones nursing infants in those the days.
40.24.20.1^pray however that not might be the flight of you in winter, nor on a sabbath.
40.24.21.1^there will be for then tribulation great, such as not has been from the beginning of the world until - now, no never not shall be.
40.24.22.1^and if not had been shortened the days those, not - there would have been saved any flesh;
40.24.22.2^because of however the elect, will be shortened the days those.
40.24.23.1^then if anyone to you says, behold, here is the christ, or here, not believe it.
40.24.24.1^there will arise for false christs and false prophets, and they will give signs great, and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect.
40.24.25.1^behold, i have foretold it to you.
40.24.26.1^if therefore they say to you, behold, in the wilderness he is, not go forth;
40.24.26.2^or  behold, in the inner rooms, not believe it.
40.24.27.1^just as for the lightning comes forth from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the son - of man.
40.24.28.1^for wherever if may be the carcass, there will be gathered the vultures.
40.24.29.1^immediately then after the tribulation the days of those:
40.24.29.2^the sun will be darkened, and the moon not will give the light of it, and the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
40.24.30.1^and then will appear the sign of the son - of man in heaven, and then will mourn all the tribes of the earth, and they will see the son - of man coming on the clouds - of heaven with power and glory great.
40.24.31.1^and he will send the angels of him with a trumpet call great, and they will gather together the elect of him, from the four winds, from the ends of the heavens to the ends of them.
40.24.32.1^of now the fig tree learn the parable:
40.24.32.2^when already the branch of it may have become tender and the leaves it puts forth, you know that near is the summer.
40.24.33.1^thus also you, when you see all these things, know that near he is, at the doors.
40.24.34.1^truly i say to you that no not will have passed away the generation this until - all these things shall have taken place.
40.24.35.1^the heaven and the earth will pass away, - but the words of me no not shall pass away.
40.24.36.1^concerning however the day that and hour, no one knows, not even the angels of the heavens, nor the son, if not the father only.
40.24.37.1^as were for the days - of noah, so will be the coming of the son - of man.
40.24.38.1^as for they were in the days those - before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until that day entered noah into the ark.
40.24.39.1^and not they knew, until came the flood and took away all;
40.24.39.2^thus will be also the coming of the son - of man.
40.24.40.1^then two will be in the field:
40.24.40.2^one is taken, and one is left.
40.24.41.1^two women will be grinding at the mill:
40.24.41.2^one is taken, and one is left.
40.24.42.1^keep watch therefore, for not you know on what day the lord of you comes.
40.24.43.1^this then know, that if had known the master of the house in what time of night the thief comes, he would have watched - and not - have allowed to be broken into the house of him.
40.24.44.1^because of this also, you be ready, for in that not you expect hour, the son - of man comes.
40.24.45.1^who then is the faithful servant, and wise, whom has set the master over the household of him, - to give to them the food in season?
40.24.46.1^blessed is the servant that, whom having come, the master of him will find thus doing.
40.24.47.1^truly i say to you that over all the possessing of him he will set him.
40.24.48.1^if however should say the evil servant that in the heart of him, delays of me the master,
40.24.49.1^and should begin to beat the fellow servants of him, to eat then and to drink with those being drunkards,
40.24.50.1^will come the master the servant of that in a day in which not he does expect, and in an hour which not he is aware,
40.24.51.1^and will cut in pieces him, and the place of him with the hypocrites will appoint;
40.24.51.2^there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
40.25.1.1^then will be likened the kingdom of the heavens to ten virgins, who having taken the lamps of them, went forth to meet the bridegroom.
40.25.2.1^five now of them were foolish, and five wise.
40.25.3.1^the for foolish, having taken the lamps of them, not did take with them oil;
40.25.4.1^- but the wise took oil in the vessels, with the lamps of them.
40.25.5.1^tarrying then the bridegroom, they became drowsy all and were sleeping.
40.25.6.1^at middle then of the night, a cry there was:
40.25.6.2^behold, the bridegroom!
40.25.6.3^go forth to meet him!
40.25.7.1^then arose all the virgins those and trimmed the lamps of them.
40.25.8.1^- and the foolish to the wise said, give us of the oil of you, for the lamps of us are going out.
40.25.9.1^answered then the wise, saying, lest no not even it might suffice for us and you.
40.25.9.2^go rather to those selling, and buy for yourselves.
40.25.10.1^while are going away then they to buy, came the bridegroom, and those ready went in with him to the wedding feast;
40.25.10.2^and was shut the door.
40.25.11.1^afterward then come also the other virgins, saying, lord, lord, open to us!
40.25.12.1^- and answering he said, truly i say to you, not i do know you.
40.25.13.1^watch therefore, for neither do you know the day, nor the hour.
40.25.14.1^it is like for a man going on a journey who called the own servants, and delivered to them the possessing of him.
40.25.15.1^and to one indeed he gave five talents, to one then two, to one then one, to each according to the own ability;
40.25.15.2^and he left the region immediately.
40.25.16.1^having gone, the one the five talents having received traded with them and made more five.
40.25.17.1^likewise, the one with the two gained more two.
40.25.18.1^the one however - one having received, having gone away, dug in the ground and hid the money of the master of him.
40.25.19.1^after then much time, comes the master of the servants those and takes account with them.
40.25.20.1^and having come, the one the five talents having received brought to him other five talents, saying, master, five talents to me you did deliver.
40.25.20.2^behold, more five talents have i gained.
40.25.21.1^said to him the master of him, well done, servant good and faithful!
40.25.21.2^over a few things you were faithful;
40.25.21.3^over many things you will i set.
40.25.21.4^enter into the joy of the master of you!
40.25.22.1^having come then also the one with the two talents, he said, master, two talents to me you did deliver.
40.25.22.2^behold, more two talents have i gained.
40.25.23.1^said to him the master of him, well done, servant good and faithful!
40.25.23.2^over a few things you were faithful;
40.25.23.3^over many things you will i set.
40.25.23.4^enter into the joy of the master of you!
40.25.24.1^having come then also the one the one talent having received, he said, master, i knew you, that hard you are a man, reaping where not you did sow, and gathering from where not you did scatter.
40.25.25.1^and having been afraid, having gone away, i hid the talent of you in the ground.
40.25.25.2^behold, you have what is yours.
40.25.26.1^answering now, the master of him said to him, wicked servant and lazy!
40.25.26.2^you knew that i reap where not i sowed, and gather from where not i scattered.
40.25.27.1^it behooved you therefore to put the money of me to the bankers, and having come, i would have received - - my own with interest.
40.25.28.1^take therefore from him the talent, and give it to the one having the ten talents.
40.25.29.1^- for having, to everyone will be given, and he will have in abundance;
40.25.29.2^the one however not having, even that which he has will be taken away from him.
40.25.30.1^and the worthless servant, cast out into the darkness - outer;
40.25.30.2^there will be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.
40.25.31.1^when then comes the son - of man in the glory of him, and all the angels with him, then he will sit upon the throne of glory of him.
40.25.32.1^and will be gathered before him all the nations, and he will separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
40.25.33.1^and he will set - indeed the sheep on the right hand of him, - and the goats on the left.
40.25.34.1^then will say the king to those on the right hand of him, come, those being blessed of the father of me, inherit the having been prepared for you kingdom from the foundation of the world.
40.25.35.1^i hungered for, and you gave me to eat;
40.25.35.2^i thirsted, and you gave to drink me;
40.25.35.3^a stranger i was, and you took in me;
40.25.36.1^naked, and you clothed me;
40.25.36.2^i was sick, and you visited me;
40.25.36.3^in prison i was, and you came to me.
40.25.37.1^then will answer him the righteous, saying, lord, when you saw we hungering, and fed you?
40.25.37.2^or thirsting, and gave you to drink?
40.25.38.1^when now you saw we a stranger, and took you in?
40.25.38.2^or naked, and clothed you?
40.25.39.1^when now you saw we ailing or in prison, and came to you?
40.25.40.1^and answering, the king will say to them, truly i say to you, to the extent as much as you did it to one of these the brothers of me the least, to me you did it.
40.25.41.1^then will he say also to those on the left, depart from me, those being cursed, into the fire - eternal, - having been prepared for the devil and the angels of him.
40.25.42.1^i hungered for, and nothing you gave to me to eat;
40.25.42.2^i thirsted, and nothing you gave to drink me;
40.25.43.1^a stranger i was, and not you took in me;
40.25.43.2^naked, and not you did clothe me;
40.25.43.3^sick and in prison, and not did you visit me.
40.25.44.1^then will answer also themselves, saying, lord, when you saw we hungering, or thirsting, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and not did minister to you?
40.25.45.1^then will he answer them, saying, truly i say to you, to the extent that not you did it to one of these the least, neither to me did you.
40.25.46.1^and will go away these into punishment eternal;
40.25.46.2^- but the righteous into life eternal.
40.26.1.1^and it came to pass, when had finished - jesus all the words these, he said to the disciples of him,
40.26.2.1^you know that after two days the passover takes place, and the son - of man is delivered over - to be crucified.
40.26.3.1^then were gathered together the chief priests and the elders of the people in the courtyard of the high priest, who is called caiaphas,
40.26.4.1^and they plotted together, in order that - jesus by guile they might seize and kill.
40.26.5.1^they were saying however, not during the feast, that not a riot there be among the people.
40.26.6.1^- and of jesus having been in bethany in the house of simon the leper,
40.26.7.1^came to him a woman, having an alabaster flask fragrant oil very costly, and poured it on the head of him as he is reclining.
40.26.8.1^having seen then, the disciples became indignant, saying, for what purpose is the waste this?
40.26.9.1^could for this have been sold for much, and have been given to the poor.
40.26.10.1^having known this now, - jesus said to them, why trouble do you cause to the woman?
40.26.10.2^a work for beautiful she did to me.
40.26.11.1^always for the poor you have with you;
40.26.11.2^me however not always you have.
40.26.12.1^in pouring for this woman the fragrant oil this on the body of me, for the burial of me she did it.
40.26.13.1^truly i say to you, wherever if shall be proclaimed the gospel this in all the world, will be spoken of also that which did this woman, for a memorial of her.
40.26.14.1^then having gone one of the twelve, the one being called judas iscariot, to the chief priests,
40.26.15.1^he said, what are you willing me to give, and i to you will betray him?
40.26.15.2^- and they appointed to him thirty pieces of silver.
40.26.16.1^and from that time, he was seeking an opportunity that him he might betray.
40.26.17.1^on the now first day of the unleavened bread, came the disciples - to jesus, saying, where wish you that we should prepare for you to eat the passover?
40.26.18.1^- and he said, go into the city unto a certain man and tell him the teacher says, the time of me near is;
40.26.18.2^with you i will keep the passover, with the disciples of me.
40.26.19.1^and did the disciples as directed them - jesus, and prepared the passover.
40.26.20.1^evening now having arrived, he was reclining with the twelve.
40.26.21.1^and as they were eating, to them he said, truly i say to you that one of you will betray me.
40.26.22.1^and being grieved exceedingly, they began to say to him, one each, not i is it, lord?
40.26.23.1^- and answering he said, the one having dipped with me the hand in the dish, he me will betray.
40.26.24.1^- indeed the son - of man goes as it has been written about him;
40.26.24.2^woe however - the man to that by whom the son - of man is betrayed.
40.26.24.3^better would it be for him if not had been born the man that.
40.26.25.1^answering now judas, who was betraying him, said, not i is it, rabbi?
40.26.25.2^he says to him, you have said.
40.26.26.1^as they were eating now of them, having taken - jesus bread, and having blessed, broke it, and having given to the disciples, he said, take, eat;
40.26.26.2^this is the body of me.
40.26.27.1^and having taken a cup and having given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, drink of it, all of you.
40.26.28.1^this for is the blood of me, of the covenant, - for many being poured out for forgiveness of sins.
40.26.29.1^i say now to you, no not will i drink, from now, of this the fruit of the vine, until the day that, when it i drink with you anew in the kingdom of the father of me.
40.26.30.1^and having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount - of olives.
40.26.31.1^then says to them - jesus, all you will fall away because of me during the night this.
40.26.31.2^it has been written for:
40.26.31.3^i will strike the shepherd, and will be scattered the sheep of the flock.
40.26.32.1^after however - being raised, i will go before you into - galilee.
40.26.33.1^answering now, - peter said to him, if all will fall away because of you, i never will fall away.
40.26.34.1^said to him - jesus, truly i say to you that during this - night, before the rooster crowing, three times you will deny me.
40.26.35.1^says to him - peter, even if it were necessary for me with you to die, no not you will i deny.
40.26.35.2^likewise also, all the disciples said.
40.26.36.1^then comes with them - jesus to a place called gethsemane, and he says to the disciples, sit here, until that having gone away over there, i shall pray.
40.26.37.1^and having taken with him - peter and the two sons of zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed.
40.26.38.1^then he says to them, very sorrowful is the soul of me, even to death;
40.26.38.2^remain here and watch with me.
40.26.39.1^and having gone forward a little, he fell upon face of him, praying, and saying, father of me, if possible it is, let pass from me the cup this.
40.26.39.2^nevertheless not as i will, but as you.
40.26.40.1^and he comes to the disciples and finds them sleeping.
40.26.40.2^and he says - to peter, thus not were you able one hour to watch with me?
40.26.41.1^watch and pray, that not you enter into temptation.
40.26.41.2^the indeed spirit is willing, - but the flesh weak.
40.26.42.1^again for a second time having gone away, he prayed, saying, father of me, if not is possible this to pass if not it i drink, be done the will of you.
40.26.43.1^and having come again, he finds them sleeping, were for of them the eyes heavy.
40.26.44.1^and having left them again, having gone away, he prayed for the third time, the same thing having said again.
40.26.45.1^then he comes to the disciples and says to them, sleep - later on and take your rest.
40.26.45.2^behold, has drawn near the hour, and the son - of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
40.26.46.1^rise up, let us go!
40.26.46.2^behold, has drawn near he who is betraying me!
40.26.47.1^and yet of him as he is speaking, behold, judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a crowd great, with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
40.26.48.1^the one then betraying him gave them a sign, saying, whomever - i shall kiss, he it is;
40.26.48.2^seize him.
40.26.49.1^and immediately having come up - to jesus, he said, greetings, rabbi, and kissed him.
40.26.50.1^- and jesus said to him, friend, for what are you come?
40.26.50.2^then having come to him, they laid - hands on - jesus and seized him.
40.26.51.1^and behold, one of those with jesus, having stretched out the hand, drew the sword of him, and having struck the servant of the high priest, cut off of him the ear.
40.26.52.1^then says to him - jesus, return the sword of you into the place of it;
40.26.52.2^all for those having taken the sword, by the sword will perish.
40.26.53.1^or think you that not i am able to call upon the father of me, and he will furnish to me presently more than twelve legions of angels?
40.26.54.1^how then should be fulfilled the scriptures, that so it must be?
40.26.55.1^in that - hour, said - jesus to the crowds, as against a robber did you come out with swords and clubs to capture me?
40.26.55.2^every day in the temple i was sitting teaching, and not you did seize me.
40.26.56.1^this then all is come to pass, that might be fulfilled the scriptures of the prophets.
40.26.56.2^then the disciples all, having forsaken him, fled.
40.26.57.1^those then having seized - jesus led him away to caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
40.26.58.1^- and peter was following him from afar, even to the court of the high priest.
40.26.58.2^and having entered within, he was sitting with the guards to see the outcome.
40.26.59.1^- and the chief priests and the council whole were seeking false testimony against - jesus, so that him they might put to death;
40.26.60.1^but not any they found, of many having come forward as false witnesses.
40.26.60.2^at last then, having come forward two,
40.26.61.1^they said, this man has been saying, i am able to destroy the temple - of god, and in three days to rebuild it.
40.26.62.1^and having stood up, the high priest said to him, nothing answer you?
40.26.62.2^what these you do witness against?
40.26.63.1^- and jesus was silent.
40.26.63.2^and the high priest said to him, i adjure you by - god the living, that us you tell if you are the christ, the son - of god.
40.26.64.1^says to him - jesus, you have said.
40.26.64.2^but i say to you, from now you will see the son - of man sitting at the right hand - of power and coming upon the clouds - of heaven.
40.26.65.1^then the high priest tears the garments of him, saying, he has blasphemed;
40.26.65.2^why any more need have we of witnesses?
40.26.65.3^behold now, you have heard the blasphemy.
40.26.66.1^what you do think?
40.26.66.2^- and answering they said, deserving of death he is.
40.26.67.1^then they spat in the face of him, and struck him.
40.26.67.2^others then slapped him,
40.26.68.1^saying, prophesy to us, christ, who is the one having struck you?
40.26.69.1^- and peter was sitting outside in the court, and came to him one servant girl, saying, also you were with jesus the galilean.
40.26.70.1^- and he denied before all, saying, not i know what you say.
40.26.71.1^having gone out then to the porch, saw him another servant girl, and says to those there, this man was with jesus of nazareth.
40.26.72.1^and again he denied with an oath -, not i know the man.
40.26.73.1^after a little while, also having come to him those standing by, they said - to peter, surely also you of them are, even for the speech of you away you gives.
40.26.74.1^then he began to curse and to swear -, not i know the man!
40.26.74.2^and immediately a rooster crowed.
40.26.75.1^and remembered - peter the word of jesus, he having said -, before the rooster crowing, three times you will deny me.
40.26.75.2^and having gone out, he wept bitterly.
40.27.1.1^morning then having arrived, counsel took all the chief priests and the elders of the people against - jesus, so that they might put to death him.
40.27.2.1^and having bound him, they led away him and delivered him to pilate, the governor.
40.27.3.1^then having seen judas, the one having delivered up him, that he was condemned, having regretted it, he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
40.27.4.1^saying, i sinned, having betrayed blood innocent.
40.27.4.2^- then they said, what is that to us?
40.27.4.3^you will see.
40.27.5.1^and having cast down the pieces of silver into the temple, he withdrew, and having gone away, hanged himself.
40.27.6.1^- and the chief priests, having taken the pieces of silver, said, not it is lawful to put them into the treasury, since the price of blood it is.
40.27.7.1^counsel then having taken, they bought with them the field of the potter, for a burial place for the strangers.
40.27.8.1^therefore was called the field that, field of blood, to - this day.
40.27.9.1^then was fulfilled that having been spoken by jeremiah the prophet, saying, and they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of the one having been priced, whom they set a price on by the sons of israel,
40.27.10.1^and they gave them for the field of the potter, as directed me the lord.
40.27.11.1^- and jesus stood before the governor;
40.27.11.2^and questioned him the governor, saying, you are the king of the jews?
40.27.11.3^- and jesus said, you say.
40.27.12.1^and in - being accused his by the chief priests and elders, nothing he answered.
40.27.13.1^then says to him - pilate, not do you hear how many things you they witness against?
40.27.14.1^and not he did answer him, to not even one word, so as to amaze the governor exceedingly.
40.27.15.1^at now the feast, was accustomed the governor to release one to the multitude prisoner, whom they were wishing.
40.27.16.1^they were holding now at that time a prisoner notable, called jesus barabbas.
40.27.17.1^being gathered together therefore of them, said to them - pilate, whom will you that i shall release to you?
40.27.17.2^jesus - barabbas, or jesus, who is called christ?
40.27.18.1^he knew for that through envy they delivered up him.
40.27.19.1^as was sitting now he on the judgment seat, sent to him the wife of him, saying, let there be nothing between you and the righteous man that;
40.27.19.2^many things for i suffered today in a dream because of him.
40.27.20.1^- and the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that they should ask for - barabbas, - and jesus should destroy.
40.27.21.1^answering now, the governor said to them, which do you desire of the two, i release to you?
40.27.21.2^- and they said, - barabbas.
40.27.22.1^says to them - pilate, what then should i do with jesus, who is called christ?
40.27.22.2^they say all, let him be crucified.
40.27.23.1^- and he said, what for evil did he commit?
40.27.23.2^- and all the more they kept crying out, saying, let him be crucified.
40.27.24.1^having seen now - pilate that nothing it availed, but rather a riot is arising, having taken water, he washed the hands before the crowd, saying, guiltless i am of the blood of this.
40.27.24.2^for yourselves you will see.
40.27.25.1^and answering, all the people said, the blood of him be on us, and on the children of us.
40.27.26.1^then he released to them - barabbas;
40.27.26.2^- and jesus having flogged, he delivered up him, that he might be crucified.
40.27.27.1^then the soldiers of the governor, having taken with them - jesus to the praetorium, gathered before him all the cohort.
40.27.28.1^and having stripped him, a robe scarlet they put around him.
40.27.29.1^and having twisted together a crown of thorns, they put it on the head of him, and a reed in the right hand of him;
40.27.29.2^and having bowed the knees before him, they mocked him, saying, hail, king of the jews!
40.27.30.1^and having spit upon him, they took the reed and kept striking him on the head of him.
40.27.31.1^and when they had mocked him, they took off him the robe, and they put on him the garments of him and led away him to - crucify him.
40.27.32.1^going forth now, they found a man of cyrene, named simon.
40.27.32.2^him they compelled that he might carry the cross of him.
40.27.33.1^and having come to a place called golgotha, which is of a skull place called,
40.27.34.1^they gave him to drink wine with gall mingled;
40.27.34.2^and having tasted, not he was willing to drink it.
40.27.35.1^having crucified now him, they divided the garments of him, casting lots.
40.27.36.1^and sitting down, they were guarding him there.
40.27.37.1^and they put up over the head of him the accusation of him written:
40.27.37.2^this is jesus, the king of the jews.
40.27.38.1^at the same time are crucified with him two robbers, one at the right hand, and one at the left.
40.27.39.1^those now passing by kept railing at him, wagging the heads of them
40.27.40.1^and saying, the one destroying the temple and in three days building it, save yourself!
40.27.40.2^if the son you are - of god, also descend from the cross!
40.27.41.1^likewise also the chief priests, mocking, with the scribes and elders, were saying,
40.27.42.1^others he saved.
40.27.42.2^himself not is he able to save.
40.27.42.3^king of israel he is.
40.27.42.4^let him descend now from the cross, and we will believe in him.
40.27.43.1^he trusted on - god.
40.27.43.2^let him deliver now if he wants him.
40.27.43.3^he said for -, of god i am the son.
40.27.44.1^- and likewise even the robbers, those having been crucified with him, were upbraiding him.
40.27.45.1^from then the sixth hour, darkness was over all the land, until the hour ninth.
40.27.46.1^about then the ninth hour, cried out - jesus in a voice loud, saying, eli, eli, lema sabachthani?
40.27.46.2^that is, god of me, god of me, so that why me have you forsaken?
40.27.47.1^some then of those who there were standing, having heard, began saying -, elijah calls this man.
40.27.48.1^and immediately, having run one of them and having taken a sponge, having filled it and with vinegar and having put it on a reed, gave to drink him.
40.27.49.1^- and the rest were saying, let be.
40.27.49.2^let us see whether comes elijah to save him.
40.27.50.1^- and jesus again, having cried in a voice loud, yielded up his spirit.
40.27.51.1^and behold, the veil of the temple was torn from top to bottom, into two;
40.27.51.2^and the earth was shaken, and the rocks were split,
40.27.52.1^and the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the having fallen asleep saints arose,
40.27.53.1^and having gone forth out of the tombs after the resurrection of him, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.
40.27.54.1^- and the centurion and those with him keeping guard over - jesus, having seen the earthquake and the things taking place, feared greatly, saying, truly god s son was this.
40.27.55.1^they were now there women many from afar off, looking on, who followed - jesus from - galilee, ministering to him,
40.27.56.1^among whom was mary - magdalene, and mary the - of james and joseph mother, and the mother of the sons of zebedee.
40.27.57.1^evening now having arrived, came a man rich from arimathea, named joseph, who also himself was discipled - to jesus.
40.27.58.1^he having gone - to pilate, asked for the body - of jesus.
40.27.58.2^then - pilate commanded it to be given up.
40.27.59.1^and having taken the body, - joseph wrapped it in a linen cloth clean
40.27.60.1^and placed it in the new of him tomb, which he had cut in the rock;
40.27.60.2^and having rolled a stone great to the door of the tomb, he went away.
40.27.61.1^was now there mary - magdalene, and the other mary, sitting opposite the tomb.
40.27.62.1^- and the next day, which is after the preparation, were gathered together the chief priests and the pharisees before pilate,
40.27.63.1^saying, sir, we have remembered how that - deceiver said while living, after three days i arise.
40.27.64.1^command therefore to be secured the tomb until the third day, lest ever having come, the disciples of him steal away him and say to the people, he is risen from the dead.
40.27.64.2^and will be the last deception worse than the first.
40.27.65.1^said to them - pilate, you have a guard.
40.27.65.2^go make it as secure as you know how.
40.27.66.1^- and having gone, they made secure the tomb, having sealed the stone, with the guard.
40.28.1.1^after then the sabbaths, it being dawn toward the first day of the week, came mary - magdalene and the other mary, to see the tomb.
40.28.2.1^and behold, an earthquake there was great;
40.28.2.2^an angel for of the lord, having descended out of heaven, and having come, rolled away the stone and was sitting upon it.
40.28.3.1^was now the appearance of him like lightning, and the clothing of him white as snow.
40.28.4.1^from now the fear of him trembled those keeping guard and became as dead men.
40.28.5.1^answering now, the angel said to the women, not fear you;
40.28.5.2^i know for that jesus, the one having been crucified, you seek.
40.28.6.1^not he is here;
40.28.6.2^he is risen for, as he said.
40.28.6.3^come, see the place where he was lying.
40.28.7.1^and quickly having gone, say to the disciples of him that he is risen from the dead and behold, he goes before you into - galilee;
40.28.7.2^there him you will see.
40.28.7.3^behold, i have told you.
40.28.8.1^and having gone out quickly from the tomb with fear and joy great, they ran to tell the disciples of him.
40.28.9.1^and behold, jesus met them, saying, greetings!
40.28.9.2^- and having come to him, they took hold of his - feet and worshiped him.
40.28.10.1^then says to them - jesus, not fear.
40.28.10.2^go, tell the brothers, of me so that they should go into - galilee, and there me will they see.
40.28.11.1^as were going now they, behold, some of the guard, having gone into the city, reported to the chief priests all the things having been done.
40.28.12.1^and having been gathered together with the elders, counsel then having taken, silver pieces many they gave to the soldiers,
40.28.13.1^saying, say that the disciples of him, by night having come, stole him, we being asleep.
40.28.14.1^and if is heard this by the governor, we will persuade him, and you out of trouble will keep.
40.28.15.1^- and having taken the money, they did as they were instructed.
40.28.15.2^and is spread abroad the report this among the jews, until the present day.
40.28.16.1^- and the eleven disciples went into - galilee, to the mountain where assigned them - jesus.
40.28.17.1^and having seen him they worshiped;
40.28.17.2^some however doubted.
40.28.18.1^and having come to them, - jesus spoke to them, saying, has been given to me all authority in heaven and on the earth.
40.28.19.1^having gone therefore, disciple all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy spirit,
40.28.20.1^teaching them to observe all things, whatever i commanded you.
40.28.20.2^and behold, i with you am all the days, until the completion of the age.
41.1.1.1^the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ, son of god.
41.1.2.1^as it has been written in - isaiah the prophet:
41.1.2.2^behold, i send the messenger of me before face of you, who will prepare the way of you.
41.1.3.1^the voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of the lord, straight make the paths of him.
41.1.4.1^came john, - baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.
41.1.5.1^and were going out to him all the of judea region, and - of jerusalem, all and were being baptized by him in the jordan river, confessing the sins of them.
41.1.6.1^and was - john clothed in hair of a camel, and a belt of leather around the waist of him;
41.1.6.2^and he is eating locusts and honey wild.
41.1.7.1^and he was preaching, saying, he comes who is mightier than i after me, of whom not i am sufficient, having stooped down, to untie the strap of the sandals of him.
41.1.8.1^i baptized you with water;
41.1.8.2^he however will baptize you with the spirit holy.
41.1.9.1^and it came to pass in those - days, that came jesus from nazareth - of galilee, and was baptized in the jordan by john.
41.1.10.1^and immediately going up from the water, he saw tearing open the heavens, and the spirit as a dove descending upon him.
41.1.11.1^and a voice came out of the heavens:
41.1.11.2^you are the son of me, the beloved, in you i am well pleased.
41.1.12.1^and immediately the spirit him drives out into the wilderness.
41.1.13.1^and he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by - satan.
41.1.13.2^and he was with the wild animals;
41.1.13.3^and the angels were ministering to him.
41.1.14.1^after and the delivering up - of john, came - jesus into - galilee, proclaiming the gospel - of god
41.1.15.1^and saying -, has been fulfilled the time, and has drawn near the kingdom - of god;
41.1.15.2^repent and believe in the gospel.
41.1.16.1^and passing by the sea - of galilee, he saw simon and andrew, the brother of simon, casting a net into the sea;
41.1.16.2^they were for fishermen.
41.1.17.1^and said to them - jesus, come after me, and i will make you to become fishers of men.
41.1.18.1^and immediately, having left the nets, they followed him.
41.1.19.1^and having gone on a little, he saw james the son - of zebedee, and john the brother of him, and they were in the boat adjusting the nets.
41.1.20.1^and immediately he called them;
41.1.20.2^and having left the father of them zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, they went away after him.
41.1.21.1^and they go into capernaum;
41.1.21.2^and immediately on the sabbaths, having entered into the synagogue, he was teaching.
41.1.22.1^and they were astonished at the teaching of him;
41.1.22.2^he was for teaching them as authority having, and not as the scribes.
41.1.23.1^and immediately there was in the synagogue of them a man with a spirit unclean, and he cried out,
41.1.24.1^saying, what to us and to you, jesus of nazareth?
41.1.24.2^did you come to destroy us?
41.1.24.3^i know you who are, the holy one - of god!
41.1.25.1^and rebuked him - jesus, saying be silent, and come forth out of him!
41.1.26.1^and having thrown into convulsions him the spirit - unclean, and having cried in a voice loud, it came forth out of him.
41.1.27.1^and were astonished all, so as to question among themselves, saying, what is this teaching new?
41.1.27.2^with authority, even the spirits - unclean he commands, and they obey him!
41.1.28.1^and went out the news of him immediately, everywhere into all the surrounding region - of galilee.
41.1.29.1^and immediately, out of the synagogue having gone forth, they came into the house of simon and andrew, with james and john.
41.1.30.1^- and the mother-in-law of simon was laying sick fevering.
41.1.30.2^and immediately they speak to him about her.
41.1.31.1^and having come to her, he raised up her, having taken hold of the hand.
41.1.31.2^and left her the fever, and she began to minister to them.
41.1.32.1^evening now having come, when went down the sun, they began bringing to him all those sick being, and those being possessed by demons.
41.1.33.1^and was all the city gathered together at the door.
41.1.34.1^and he healed many sick being of various diseases, and demons many he cast out.
41.1.34.2^and not he would allow to speak the demons, because they knew him.
41.1.35.1^and very early, in night still much, having risen up, he went out and departed into solitary a place, and there he was praying.
41.1.36.1^and went after him simon and those with him,
41.1.37.1^and having found him, also they say to him -, everyone seeks you!
41.1.38.1^and he says to them, let us go another way into the neighboring towns, so that also there i might preach;
41.1.38.2^for this therefore have i come forth.
41.1.39.1^and he was going, preaching in the synagogues of them, in all - galilee, and - demons casting out.
41.1.40.1^and comes to him a leper, imploring him and kneeling down to him, and saying to him -, if you are willing, you are able me to cleanse.
41.1.41.1^and having been moved with compassion, having stretched out the hand of him, he touched him and says to him, i am willing;
41.1.41.2^be you cleansed.
41.1.42.1^and immediately departed from him the leprosy, and he was cleansed.
41.1.43.1^and having sternly warned him, immediately he sent away him.
41.1.44.1^and he says to him, see that nothing to none you speak.
41.1.44.2^but go, yourself show to the priest, and offer for the cleansing of you what commanded moses, for a testimony to them.
41.1.45.1^- and having gone out, he began to proclaim much and to spread abroad the matter, so that no longer he was able openly into the city to enter;
41.1.45.2^but out in solitary places he was, and they were coming to him from every quarter.
41.2.1.1^and he having entered again into capernaum after some days, it was heard that in the house he is.
41.2.2.1^and were gathered together many, so that no more to have space, not even - at the door;
41.2.2.2^and he was speaking to them the word.
41.2.3.1^and they come, bringing to him a paralytic, being carried by four.
41.2.4.1^and not being able to come near to him on account of the crowd, they removed the roof where he was, and having broken up it, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic was lying.
41.2.5.1^and having seen - jesus the faith of them, he says to the paralytic, son, are forgiven of you the sins.
41.2.6.1^were now some of the scribes there sitting and reasoning in the hearts of them,
41.2.7.1^why this man thus does speak?
41.2.7.2^he blasphemes!
41.2.7.3^who is able to forgive sins, if not alone - god?
41.2.8.1^and immediately, having known - jesus in the spirit of him that thus they are reasoning within themselves, he says to them, why these things reason you in the hearts of you?
41.2.9.1^which is easier, to say to the paralytic, are forgiven of you the sins, or to say, arise, and take up the mat of you, and walk
41.2.10.1^that however you might know that authority has the son - of man to forgive sins on the earth.
41.2.10.2^.
41.2.10.3^.
41.2.10.4^he says to the paralytic,
41.2.11.1^to you i say, arise, take up the mat of you, and go to the home of you.
41.2.12.1^and he arose and immediately, having taken up the mat, he went forth before all, so as for to be amazed all, and to glorify - god, saying -, thus never did we see.
41.2.13.1^and he went forth again beside the sea, and all the crowd was coming to him, and he taught them.
41.2.14.1^and passing on, he saw levi the son - of alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he says to him, follow me.
41.2.14.2^and having arisen, he followed him.
41.2.15.1^and it came to pass, reclining of him in the house of him, that many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with - jesus and the disciples of him;
41.2.15.2^there were for many, and they were following him.
41.2.16.1^and the scribes of the pharisees, having seen him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, were saying to the disciples of him, why with the tax collectors and sinners does he eat?
41.2.17.1^and having heard, - jesus says to them -, no need have those being strong of a physician, but those sick being.
41.2.17.2^not i came to call the righteous , but sinners.
41.2.18.1^and were the disciples of john and the pharisees fasting.
41.2.18.2^and they come and say to him, because of why the disciples of john and the disciples of the pharisees fast, - but your disciples not fast?
41.2.19.1^and said to them - jesus, not are able the sons of the bridechamber, in which the bridegroom with them is, to fast?
41.2.19.2^as long as time they have the bridegroom with them, not they are able to fast.
41.2.20.1^will come however the days when will have been taken away from them the bridegroom, and then they will fast in those the days.
41.2.21.1^no one a patch of cloth unshrunk sews on clothing old;
41.2.21.2^if now not tears away the patch from it, - new from the old, and worse a tear takes place.
41.2.22.1^and no one puts wine new into wineskins old;
41.2.22.2^if now not, will burst the wine the wineskins, and the wine will be destroyed, and the wineskins.
41.2.22.3^instead, wine new into wineskins new.
41.2.23.1^and it came to pass, he on the sabbaths is passing through the grainfields, and the disciples of him began their way to make, plucking the heads of grain.
41.2.24.1^and the pharisees were saying to him, behold, why do they on the sabbaths that which not is lawful?
41.2.25.1^and he said to them, never did you read what did david, when need he had and hungered, he and those with him?
41.2.26.1^how he entered into the house - of god in the days of abiathar the high priest, and the loaves of the presentation ate, which not it is lawful to eat, if not for the priests.
41.2.26.2^and he gave even to those with him being?
41.2.27.1^and he said to them, the sabbath on account of the man was made, and not the man on account of the sabbath.
41.2.28.1^so then, lord is the son - of man also even of the sabbath.
41.3.1.1^and he entered again into the synagogue, and there was there a man, withered having the hand,
41.3.2.1^and they were watching him, whether on the sabbaths he will heal him, in order that they might accuse him.
41.3.3.1^and he says to the man - the withered, hand having arise into the midst.
41.3.4.1^and he says to them, is it lawful on the sabbaths - to do good, or to do evil?
41.3.4.2^life to save, or to kill?
41.3.4.3^- but they were silent.
41.3.5.1^and having looked around on them with anger, being grieved at the hardness of the heart of them, he says to the man, stretch out the hand and he stretched it out, and was restored the hand of him.
41.3.6.1^and having gone out, the pharisees immediately with the herodians counsel began to take against him, how him they might destroy.
41.3.7.1^and - jesus, with the disciples of him, withdrew to the sea, and great a multitude from - galilee followed, and from - judea,
41.3.8.1^and from jerusalem, and from - idumea, and beyond the jordan, and around tyre and sidon.
41.3.8.2^a multitude great, having heard how much he was doing, came to him.
41.3.9.1^and he spoke to the disciples of him that a boat might wait upon him on account of the crowd, that not they might press upon him.
41.3.10.1^many for he healed, so as for to press upon him, that him they might touch, as many as had diseases.
41.3.11.1^and the spirits - unclean, whenever him they beheld, were falling down before him and crying out, saying -, you are the son - of god.
41.3.12.1^and much he would rebuke them, so that not him known they should make.
41.3.13.1^and he goes up on the mountain and calls near those whom he wanted himself;
41.3.13.2^and they went to him.
41.3.14.1^and he appointed twelve ones also apostles.
41.3.14.2^he called them that they might be with him, and that he might send them to preach,
41.3.15.1^and to have authority to cast out - demons.
41.3.16.1^and he appointed the twelve.
41.3.16.2^and he added the name to simon, peter;
41.3.17.1^and james the son of zebedee, and john the brother - of james, and he added to them the name boanerges, which is, sons of thunder;
41.3.18.1^and andrew, and philip, and bartholomew, and matthew, and thomas, and james the son - of alphaeus, and thaddaeus, and simon the zealot,
41.3.19.1^and judas iscariot, who also betrayed him.
41.3.20.1^and he comes to a house, and comes together again a crowd, so that not are they able them even bread to eat.
41.3.21.1^and having heard of it, those belonging to him went out to seize him;
41.3.21.2^they were saying for -, he is out of his mind.
41.3.22.1^and the scribes, those from jerusalem having come down, were saying -, beelzebul he has, and - by the prince of the demons he casts out the demons.
41.3.23.1^and having called to him them, in parables he began speaking to them:
41.3.23.2^how is able satan, satan to cast out?
41.3.24.1^and if a kingdom against itself is divided, not is able to stand the kingdom that.
41.3.25.1^and if a house against itself is divided, not will be able the house that to stand.
41.3.26.1^and if - satan has risen up against himself and has been divided, not he is able to stand, but an end is coming to.
41.3.27.1^but not is able no one, into the house of the strong man having entered, the goods of him to plunder, if not first the strong man he binds.
41.3.27.2^and then the house of him he will plunder.
41.3.28.1^truly i say to you that all will be forgiven the sons the of men, the sins and the blasphemies, as many as if they shall have blasphemed.
41.3.29.1^whoever however - shall blaspheme against the spirit - holy not has forgiveness to the age, but guilty is of eternal sin.
41.3.30.1^for they were saying, a spirit unclean he has.
41.3.31.1^and arrive the mother of him and the brothers of him, and outside standing, sent to him, calling him.
41.3.32.1^and was sitting around him a crowd.
41.3.32.2^and they said to him, behold, the mother of you and the brothers of you and the sisters of you outside are seeking you.
41.3.33.1^and he answering them, says, who are the mother of me and the brothers of me?
41.3.34.1^and having looked around on those who around him in a circle were sitting, he says, behold, the mother of me, and the brothers of me!
41.3.35.1^whoever for - shall do the will - of god, he brother of me, and sister, and mother is.
41.4.1.1^and again, he began to teach beside the sea.
41.4.1.2^and was gathered together to him a crowd great, so that he into a boat having entered, sat in the sea, and all the crowd close to the sea on the land was.
41.4.2.1^and he began teaching them in parables many things, and he was saying to them in the teaching of him,
41.4.3.1^listen!
41.4.3.2^behold, went out the one sowing to sow.
41.4.4.1^and it came to pass as - he sowed, some - fell along the road, and came the birds and devoured it.
41.4.5.1^and other fell upon the rocky place, where not it had soil much, and immediately it sprang up, because of the not having depth of soil.
41.4.6.1^and after rose the sun, it was scorched, and because of - not having root, it withered away.
41.4.7.1^and other fell among the thorns, and grew up the thorns, and choked it, and fruit no it yielded.
41.4.8.1^and other fell into the soil - good, and began yielding fruit, growing up and increasing, and bearing one thirtyfold, and one sixty, and one a hundred.
41.4.9.1^and he was saying, he who has ears to hear, let him hear.
41.4.10.1^and when he was with alone, began asking him those around him with the twelve about the parable.
41.4.11.1^and he was saying to them, to you the mystery has been given of the kingdom - of god.
41.4.11.2^to those however who are outside, in parables - everything is done,
41.4.12.1^so that, seeing, they might see and not perceive;
41.4.12.2^and hearing, they might hear and not understand;
41.4.12.3^lest ever they should turn, and should be forgiven them.
41.4.13.1^and he says to them, not understand you the parable this?
41.4.13.2^and how all the parables will you understand?
41.4.14.1^the one sowing, the word sows.
41.4.15.1^these now are they along the road, where is sown the word, and when they hear, immediately comes - satan and takes away the word - having been sown in them.
41.4.16.1^and these are those upon the rocky places sown, who, when they hear the word, immediately with joy receive it,
41.4.17.1^and not they have root in themselves, but temporary are;
41.4.17.2^then having arisen tribulation or persecution on account of the word, immediately they fall away.
41.4.18.1^and these are those among the thorns sown.
41.4.18.2^these are those, the word having heard,
41.4.19.1^and the cares - of this age, and the deceit of the riches, and - of the other things desires entering in, choke the word, and unfruitful it becomes.
41.4.20.1^and these are those upon the soil - good having been sown;
41.4.20.2^such as hear the word and receive it, and bring forth fruit, one thirtyfold, and one sixty, and one a hundred.
41.4.21.1^and he was saying to them not is brought in the lamp so that under the basket it might be put, or under the bed?
41.4.21.2^is it not that upon the lampstand it might be put?
41.4.22.1^nothing for there is hidden, if not that it should be made manifest, nor has taken place a secret thing, but that it should come to light.
41.4.23.1^if anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.
41.4.24.1^and he was saying to them, take heed what you hear.
41.4.24.2^with what measure you measure it will be measured to you, and more will be added to you.
41.4.25.1^whoever for may have, it will be given to him;
41.4.25.2^and he who not has, even that which he has will be taken away from him.
41.4.26.1^and he was saying, thus is the kingdom - of god, as a man should cast the seed upon the earth,
41.4.27.1^and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should sprout and grow;
41.4.27.2^how not knows he.
41.4.28.1^of itself, the earth brings forth fruit   first a plant, then an ear, then full grain in the ear.
41.4.29.1^when then offers itself the fruit, immediately he sends the sickle, for has come the harvest.
41.4.30.1^and he was saying, to what shall we liken the kingdom - of god?
41.4.30.2^or in what it parable shall we present?
41.4.31.1^as to a grain of mustard, which, when it has been sown upon the earth, smallest is of all the seeds which are upon the earth,
41.4.32.1^and when it has been sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all the garden plants, and it produces branches great, so that are able under the shadow of it the birds of the air to perch.
41.4.33.1^and with such parables many, he kept speaking to them the word, as they were able to hear.
41.4.34.1^without then parables, not would he speak to them;
41.4.34.2^in private however, to his own disciples he would explain all things.
41.4.35.1^and he says to them on that - day, evening having come, let us pass over to the other side.
41.4.36.1^and having dismissed the crowd, they take with them him since he was in the boat;
41.4.36.2^also other boats were with him.
41.4.37.1^and comes a storm violent of wind, and the waves were breaking over the boat, so that already is being filled up the boat.
41.4.38.1^and he was in the stern, on the cushion sleeping.
41.4.38.2^and they awaken him and say to him, teacher, not is it concern to you that we perish?
41.4.39.1^and having been awoken he rebuked the wind and said to the sea, silence, be still.
41.4.39.2^and abated the wind, and there was a calm great.
41.4.40.1^and he said to them, why fearful are you?
41.4.40.2^still not have you faith?
41.4.41.1^and they feared with fear great, and were saying to each other, who then this is, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
41.5.1.1^and they came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the gerasenes.
41.5.2.1^and having gone forth of him out of the boat, immediately met him out of the tombs a man with a spirit unclean,
41.5.3.1^who the dwelling had in the tombs.
41.5.3.2^and not even with chains no longer anyone was able him to bind,
41.5.4.1^because that he often with shackles and chains had been bound, and had been torn in two by him the chains, and the shackles had been shattered, and no one was able him to subdue.
41.5.5.1^and constantly all night and day in the tombs and in the mountains he was crying out and cutting himself with stones.
41.5.6.1^and having seen - jesus from afar, he ran and fell on his knees before him.
41.5.7.1^and having cried in a voice loud, he said, what to me and to you, jesus, son - of god the most high?
41.5.7.2^i adjure you - by god, not me torment.
41.5.8.1^he was saying for to him, you come forth, the spirit - unclean, out of the man!
41.5.9.1^and he was asking him, what is the name of you?
41.5.9.2^and saying, he answered, legion is name to me, because many we are.
41.5.10.1^and he begged him numerous times that not them he would send out of the country.
41.5.11.1^there was now there, near the mountain, a herd of pigs great feeding.
41.5.12.1^and they begged him, saying, send us into the pigs, so that into them we may enter.
41.5.13.1^and he allowed them.
41.5.13.2^and having gone out, the spirits - unclean entered into the pigs, and rushed the herd down the steep bank into the sea, about two thousand, and they were drowned in the sea.
41.5.14.1^and those feeding them fled and proclaimed it to the city and to the country.
41.5.14.2^and they went out to see what it is that has been done.
41.5.15.1^and they come to - jesus and see the man possessed by demons sitting, clothed and sound minded, the one having had the legion;
41.5.15.2^and they were afraid.
41.5.16.1^and related to them those having seen it how it happened to the one being possessed by demons, and concerning the pigs.
41.5.17.1^and they began to implore him to depart from the region of them.
41.5.18.1^and having entered he into the boat, was begging him the one having been possessed by demons, that with him he might be.
41.5.19.1^and not he did permit him, but he says to him, go to the home of you, to - your own, and report to them how much the lord for you did and had mercy on you.
41.5.20.1^and he departed and began to proclaim in the decapolis how much had done for him - jesus;
41.5.20.2^and all were marveling.
41.5.21.1^and having passed over - jesus in the boat again to the other side, was gathered a crowd great to him, and he was beside the sea.
41.5.22.1^and comes one of the synagogue rulers, named jairus, and having seen him, falls at the feet of him
41.5.23.1^and he begs him much, saying -, the little daughter of me at the end is holding, that, having come, you would lay the hands on her, so that she might be cured, and she shall live.
41.5.24.1^and he departed with him.
41.5.24.2^and was following him a crowd great, and pressing in on him.
41.5.25.1^and a woman, being with a flux of blood twelve years,
41.5.26.1^and much having suffered under many physicians, and having spent the of her all, and in no way having benefited, but rather to the worse having come,
41.5.27.1^having heard concerning - jesus, having come up in the crowd behind, she touched the clothing of him.
41.5.28.1^she was saying for -, if i shall touch even the garments of him, i will be healed.
41.5.29.1^and immediately was dried up the flow of the blood of her, and she knew in the body that she was healed from the affliction.
41.5.30.1^and immediately - jesus, having known in himself the out of him power having gone forth, having turned in the crowd, said, who of me touched the garments?
41.5.31.1^and were saying to him the disciples of him, you see the crowd pressing in on you, and say you, who me touched?
41.5.32.1^and he was looking around to see the one this having done.
41.5.33.1^- and the woman, having been frightened and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him and told him all the truth.
41.5.34.1^- and he said to her, daughter, the faith of you has healed you;
41.5.34.2^go in peace and be sound from the affliction of you.
41.5.35.1^while yet he is speaking, they come from the ruler of synagogue s house, saying -, the daughter of you is dead;
41.5.35.2^why still trouble you the teacher?
41.5.36.1^- and jesus, having heard the word spoken, says to the ruler of the synagogue, not fear;
41.5.36.2^only believe.
41.5.37.1^and not he allowed no one with him to follow, if not - peter and james and john the brother of james.
41.5.38.1^and they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and he beholds a commotion, and weeping and wailing much.
41.5.39.1^and having entered, he says to them, why make you commotion and weep?
41.5.39.2^the child not is dead, but sleeps.
41.5.40.1^and they were laughing at him.
41.5.40.2^he then, having put out all, takes with him the father of the child, and the mother, and those with him, and enters in where was the child.
41.5.41.1^and having taken the hand of the child, he says to her, talitha, koum!
41.5.41.2^which is, translated, - little girl, to you i say, arise!
41.5.42.1^and immediately arose the girl and began walking;
41.5.42.2^she was for of years twelve.
41.5.42.3^and they were overcome immediately with amazement great.
41.5.43.1^and he instructed them strictly that no one should know this;
41.5.43.2^and he commanded to be given to her to eat.
41.6.1.1^and he went out from there and came into the hometown of him;
41.6.1.2^and follow him the disciples of him.
41.6.2.1^and having come the sabbath, he began to teach in the synagogue;
41.6.2.2^and many hearing were astonished, saying, from where to this man these things, and what is the wisdom - having been given to him, even the miracles, such by the hands of him are done?
41.6.3.1^not this is the carpenter, the son - of mary, and brother of james and joseph and judas and simon?
41.6.3.2^and not are the sisters of him here with us?
41.6.3.3^and they took offense at him.
41.6.4.1^and said to them - jesus -, not is a prophet without honor, if not in the hometown of him, and among - relatives of him, and in the household of him.
41.6.5.1^and not he was able there to do not any work of power, if not on a few sick, having laid the hands, he healed.
41.6.6.1^and he was amazed because of the unbelief of them.
41.6.6.2^and he was going the villages around, teaching.
41.6.7.1^and he calls near the twelve, and he began them to send forth two by two, and he gave to them authority over the spirits - unclean.
41.6.8.1^and he instructed them that nothing they should take for the journey, if not a staff only;
41.6.8.2^no bread, nor bag, nor in the belt money;
41.6.9.1^but wearing sandals, and not put on two tunics.
41.6.10.1^and he would say to them, wherever if you enter into a house, there remain until - you go out from there.
41.6.11.1^and whatever - place not will receive you nor hear you, departing from there, shake off the dust which is under the feet of you, for a testimony against them.
41.6.12.1^and having gone out, they preached that they should repent.
41.6.13.1^and demons many they were casting out, and were anointing with oil many sick and healing them.
41.6.14.1^and heard - king herod;
41.6.14.2^well known for became the name of him.
41.6.14.3^and they were saying -, john, the one baptizing, is risen out from the dead, and because of this operate the miraculous powers in him.
41.6.15.1^others however were saying -, elijah he is.
41.6.15.2^others now were saying -, a prophet, like one of the prophets.
41.6.16.1^having heard now, - herod was saying, whom i beheaded, john   he is risen!
41.6.17.1^himself for - herod, having sent, seized - john and bound him in prison, on account of herodias, the wife of philip the brother of him, because her he had married.
41.6.18.1^had been saying for - john - to herod -, not it is lawful for you to have the wife of the brother of you.
41.6.19.1^- and herodias held it against him, and wished him to kill, and not was able;
41.6.20.1^- for herod was afraid of - john, knowing him to be a man righteous and holy;
41.6.20.2^and he kept safe him.
41.6.20.3^and having heard him, greatly he was perplexed and gladly him heard.
41.6.21.1^and having come a day opportune, when herod on the birthday of him a banquet made to the great men of him, and to the chief captains, and to the leading men - of galilee,
41.6.22.1^and having come in the daughter of him herodias, and having danced, pleased - herod and those reclining with him.
41.6.22.2^said the king to the girl, ask me whatever if you wish, and i will give to you.
41.6.23.1^and he swore to her, whatever - that if me you might ask, i will give you, up to half of the kingdom of me.
41.6.24.1^and having gone out, she said to the mother of her, what shall i ask?
41.6.24.2^- and she said, the head of john the one baptizing.
41.6.25.1^and having entered immediately with haste to the king, she asked, saying, i desire that at once you give to me upon a platter the head of john the baptist.
41.6.26.1^and encompassingly sorrowful having been made the king, on account of the oaths and those reclining with him, not was he willing to refuse her.
41.6.27.1^and immediately having sent the king an executioner, he commanded to be brought the head of him.
41.6.27.2^and having gone, he beheaded him in the prison,
41.6.28.1^and brought the head of him upon a platter, and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to the mother of her.
41.6.29.1^and having heard it, the disciples of him came, and took up the body of him, and laid it in a tomb.
41.6.30.1^and are gathered together the apostles to - jesus, and they related to him all things, what they had done and what they had taught.
41.6.31.1^and he said to them, come you yourselves apart own to a solitary place, and rest a little.
41.6.31.2^were for those coming and those going many, and not even to eat had they opportunity.
41.6.32.1^and they went away by the boat into a solitary place by themselves.
41.6.33.1^and they saw them going, and recognized many, and on foot from all the cities ran together there, and went before them.
41.6.34.1^and having gone out, he saw a great crowd and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were like sheep not having a shepherd.
41.6.34.2^and he began to teach them many things.
41.6.35.1^and already the hour late being, having come to him, the disciples of him were saying -, desolate is the place, and already it is an hour late.
41.6.36.1^dismiss them, that having gone to the surrounding region and villages, they might buy for themselves something to eat.
41.6.37.1^- but answering, he said to them, give to them you something to eat.
41.6.37.2^and they say to him, having gone, shall we buy denarii two hundred of bread, and give them to eat?
41.6.38.1^- and he says to them, how many loaves?
41.6.38.2^have you go, see.
41.6.38.3^and having known, they say, five, and two fish.
41.6.39.1^and he commanded them to make recline all, groups by groups on the green grass.
41.6.40.1^and they sat down groups by groups, by hundreds and by fifties.
41.6.41.1^and having taken the five loaves and the two fish, having looked up to the heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves, and he kept giving them to the disciples of him that they might set before them.
41.6.41.2^and the two fish he divided among all.
41.6.42.1^and ate all and were satisfied.
41.6.43.1^and they took up of fragments twelve hand-baskets full, and of the fish.
41.6.44.1^and were those having eaten of the loaves five thousand men.
41.6.45.1^and immediately he compelled the disciples of him to enter into the boat and to go before to the other side, to bethsaida, until he should dismiss the crowd.
41.6.46.1^and having taken leave of them, he departed into the mountain to pray.
41.6.47.1^and evening having come, was the boat in the midst of the sea, and he alone upon the land.
41.6.48.1^and he having seen them straining in the rowing, was for the wind contrary to them.
41.6.48.2^about the fourth watch of the night he comes to them, walking on the sea, and he was wishing to pass by them.
41.6.49.1^- and having seen him on the sea walking, they thought that a ghost it is, and cried out.
41.6.50.1^all for him saw and were troubled.
41.6.50.2^- and immediately he spoke with them, and says to them, take courage;
41.6.50.3^i am he;
41.6.50.4^not fear.
41.6.51.1^and he went up to them into the boat, and ceased the wind.
41.6.51.2^and exceedingly in abundance in themselves they were amazed,
41.6.52.1^not for they understood by the loaves;
41.6.52.2^but had been of them the heart hardened.
41.6.53.1^and having passed over to the land, they came to gennesaret and drew to shore.
41.6.54.1^and on having come of them out of the boat, immediately having recognized him,
41.6.55.1^they ran around all the country that, and they began on the mats those sick being to carry about, to wherever they were hearing that he is.
41.6.56.1^and wherever - he entered into villages or into cities or into fields, in the marketplaces they were laying the ailing, and were begging him that only the fringe the clothing of him they might touch;
41.6.56.2^and as many as - touched him were being healed.
41.7.1.1^and are gathered together to him the pharisees and some of the scribes, having come from jerusalem.
41.7.2.1^and they had seen some of the disciples of him that with defiled hands, that is unwashed, are eating the bread.
41.7.3.1^- for the pharisees and all the jews, if not carefully they wash the hands, not eat, holding the tradition of the elders;
41.7.4.1^and on coming from the market, if not they wash not they eat;
41.7.4.2^and other things many there are which they received for them to hold to   washings of cups and vessels and utensils and couches for dining.
41.7.5.1^and questioned him the pharisees and the scribes, because of why not walk the disciples of you according to the tradition of the elders, but with unwashed hands eat the bread?
41.7.6.1^- and he said to them, rightly prophesied isaiah concerning you - hypocrites, as it has been written -:
41.7.6.2^this - people with the lips me honors, - but the heart of them far away is kept from me.
41.7.7.1^in vain now they worship me, teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.
41.7.8.1^having neglected the commandment - of god, you hold to the tradition - of men.
41.7.9.1^and he was saying to them, neatly do you set aside the commandment - of god, that the tradition of you, you might keep.
41.7.10.1^moses for said, honor the father of you and the mother of you,  and, the one speaking evil of father or mother, in death must end.
41.7.11.1^you however say that if says a man to the father or the mother, it is corban, that is, a gift, whatever if from me you might be profited,
41.7.12.1^no longer do you allow him anything to do for the father or the mother,
41.7.13.1^making void the word - of god for the tradition of you which you have handed down.
41.7.13.2^and like things such many you do.
41.7.14.1^and having called to him again the crowd, he was saying to them, listen to me, all, and understand:
41.7.15.1^nothing there is from outside the man entering into him, which is able to defile him;
41.7.15.2^but the things out of the man proceeding are the things defiling the man.
41.7.17.1^and when he went into the house from the crowd, were asking him the disciples of him the parable.
41.7.18.1^and he says to them, thus also you without understanding are?
41.7.18.2^not understand you that everything - from outside entering into the man, not is able him to defile,
41.7.19.1^because not it enters of him into the heart, but into the belly, and into the sewer goes out?
41.7.19.2^purifying all the food.
41.7.20.1^he was saying now -, that out of the man going forth, that defiles the man.
41.7.21.1^within for from the heart - of men - thoughts - evil go forth, sexual immorality, thefts, murders,
41.7.22.1^adulteries, covetous desires, wickednesses, deceit, sensuality, an eye evil, slander, pride, foolishness.
41.7.23.1^all these - evils from within go forth, and they defile the man.
41.7.24.1^from there also having risen up, he went away into the region of tyre.
41.7.24.2^and having entered into a house, no one he was wishing to know it, and not he was able to be hidden.
41.7.25.1^but immediately having heard a woman about him, of whom had the little daughter of her spirit unclean, having come, fell at the feet of him.
41.7.26.1^- now the woman was gentile, syrophoenician by race, and kept asking him that the demon he should cast forth out of the daughter of her.
41.7.27.1^and he was saying to her, permit first to be satisfied the children;
41.7.27.2^not for it is good to take the bread of the children, and to the dogs to cast it.
41.7.28.1^- but she answered and says to him, lord;
41.7.28.2^even the dogs under the table eat of the crumbs of the children.
41.7.29.1^and he said to her, because of this - word, go;
41.7.29.2^has gone forth out of the daughter of you the demon.
41.7.30.1^and having gone away to the home of her, she found the child lying on the bed, and the demon having gone out.
41.7.31.1^and again having departed from the region of tyre, he came through sidon, to the sea - of galilee through the midst of the region of the decapolis.
41.7.32.1^and they bring to him a deaf man and who spoke with difficulty, and they implore him that he might lay on him the hand.
41.7.33.1^and having taken away him from the crowd aside privately, he put the fingers of him to the ears of him, and having spit, he touched the tongue of him,
41.7.34.1^and having looked up to - heaven he sighed deeply, and he says to him, ephphatha!
41.7.34.2^that is, be opened!
41.7.35.1^and immediately were opened his - ears, and was loosed the band of the tongue of him, and he began speaking plainly.
41.7.36.1^and he instructed them that no one they should tell.
41.7.36.2^as much as however he kept instructing them, more abundantly they were proclaiming it.
41.7.37.1^and above measure they were astonished, saying, well all things he has done;
41.7.37.2^both the deaf he makes to hear, and the mute to speak.
41.8.1.1^in those - days, again great the crowd being and not having what they might eat, having called to him the disciples, he says to them,
41.8.2.1^i am moved with compassion upon the crowd, because already days three they continue with me, and nothing have that they might eat.
41.8.3.1^and if i shall send away them hungry to the homes of them, they will faint on the way.
41.8.3.2^for some of them from afar are come.
41.8.4.1^and answered him the disciples of him -, from where these will be able anyone here to satisfy with bread in this desolate place?
41.8.5.1^and he was asking them, how many have you loaves?
41.8.5.2^- and they said, seven.
41.8.6.1^and he directs the crowd to recline on the ground.
41.8.6.2^and having taken the seven loaves, having given thanks, he broke them and kept giving them to disciples of him, that they might set before them.
41.8.6.3^and they set it before the crowd.
41.8.7.1^and they had small fish a few.
41.8.7.2^and having blessed them, he ordered also these to be set before them.
41.8.8.1^and they ate and were satisfied.
41.8.8.2^and they took up over and above of fragments seven baskets.
41.8.9.1^there were now about four thousand.
41.8.9.2^and he sent away them.
41.8.10.1^and immediately having entered into the boat with the disciples of him, he came into the district of dalmanutha.
41.8.11.1^and went out the pharisees and began to dispute with him, seeking from him a sign from - heaven, testing him.
41.8.12.1^and having sighed deeply in the spirit of him, he says, why the generation this seeks a sign?
41.8.12.2^truly i say to you, if there will be given to the generation this a sign.
41.8.13.1^and having left them, again having embarked, he went away to the other side.
41.8.14.1^and they forgot to take loaves, and if not one loaf not they had with them in the boat.
41.8.15.1^and he was instructing them, saying, watch out;
41.8.15.2^take heed of the leaven of the pharisees, and of the leaven of herod.
41.8.16.1^and they were reasoning with one another because loaves not they have.
41.8.17.1^and having known it, he says to them, why reason you because loaves not you have?
41.8.17.2^not yet do you perceive nor understand?
41.8.17.3^hardened do you have the heart of you?
41.8.18.1^eyes having, not do you see?
41.8.18.2^and ears having, not do you hear?
41.8.18.3^and not do you remember?
41.8.19.1^when the five loaves i broke for the five thousand, how many hand-baskets of fragments full took you up?
41.8.19.2^they say to him, twelve.
41.8.20.1^when the seven to the four thousand, of how many baskets the fillings of fragments took you up?
41.8.20.2^and said they, seven.
41.8.21.1^and he was saying to them, not yet do you understand?
41.8.22.1^and they come to bethsaida.
41.8.22.2^and they bring to him a blind man, and implore him that him he might touch.
41.8.23.1^and having taken hold of the hand of the blind man, he led forth him out of the village, and having spit upon the eyes of him, having laid the hands upon him, he was asking him if anything you see.
41.8.24.1^and having looked up he was saying, i see the men, for as trees i see them walking.
41.8.25.1^then again he laid the hands upon the eyes of him, and he opened his eyes and he was restored, and he began to see clearly everything.
41.8.26.1^and he sent him to the home of him, saying, not into the village may you enter.
41.8.27.1^and went forth - jesus and the disciples of him into the villages of caesarea - philippi.
41.8.27.2^and on the way, he was questioning the disciples of him, saying to them, whom me do pronounce - men to be?
41.8.28.1^- and they answered him, saying -, john the baptist;
41.8.28.2^and others, elijah;
41.8.28.3^others now -, one of the prophets.
41.8.29.1^and he was questioning them, you however, whom me do pronounce to be?
41.8.29.2^answering, - peter says to him, you are the christ.
41.8.30.1^and he warned them that no one they should tell concerning him.
41.8.31.1^and he began to teach them that it is necessary for the son - of man many things to suffer, and to be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and to be killed, and after three days to rise again.
41.8.32.1^and openly the word he was speaking.
41.8.32.2^and having taken him - peter to him, he began to rebuke him.
41.8.33.1^- and having turned and having looked upon the disciples of him, he rebuked peter and said, get behind me, satan, for not you have in mind the things of god, but the things of men.
41.8.34.1^and having called to him the crowd with the disciples of him, he said to them, if anyone desires after me to follow, let him deny himself, and let him take up the cross of him, and let him follow me.
41.8.35.1^whoever for if might desire - life his to save, will lose it;
41.8.35.2^whoever now - will lose the life of him on account of me and of the gospel, he will save it.
41.8.36.1^what for does it profit a man to gain the world whole and to lose the soul of him?
41.8.37.1^what for shall give a man as an exchange for the soul of him?
41.8.38.1^whoever for if may be ashamed of me and - my words in the generation this - adulterous and sinful, also the son - of man will be ashamed of him when he shall come in the glory of the father of him, with the angels - holy.
41.9.1.1^and he was saying to them, truly i say to you that there are some here of those standing, who no not shall taste of death, until - they see the kingdom - of god having come with power.
41.9.2.1^and after days six takes along - jesus, - peter and - james and - john, and brings up them into a mountain high apart themselves alone.
41.9.2.2^and he was transfigured before them,
41.9.3.1^and the garments of him became shining white exceedingly, such as a launderer on the earth not is able thus to whiten.
41.9.4.1^and appeared to them elijah with moses, and they were talking with - jesus.
41.9.5.1^and answering, - peter says - to jesus, rabbi, good it is for us here to be.
41.9.5.2^and let us make three tabernacles:
41.9.5.3^for you one, and for moses one, and for elijah one.
41.9.6.1^not for he knew what he should say;
41.9.6.2^terrified for they were.
41.9.7.1^and there came a cloud overshadowing them, and there came a voice out of the cloud:
41.9.7.2^this is the son of me, the beloved;
41.9.7.3^listen you to him.
41.9.8.1^and suddenly, having looked around, no longer no one they saw except - jesus alone with them.
41.9.9.1^and descending of them from the mountain, he instructed them that to no one what they had seen they should tell, if not until the son - of man out from the dead had risen.
41.9.10.1^and that saying they kept among themselves, questioning what it is - out from the dead to rise.
41.9.11.1^and they were asking him, saying -, say the scribes that elijah it behooves to come first?
41.9.12.1^- and he was saying to them, elijah indeed having come first, restores all things;
41.9.12.2^and how has it been written of the son - of man, that many things he should suffer and be set at naught?
41.9.13.1^but i say to you, that also elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they desired, as it has been written of him.
41.9.14.1^and having come to the disciples, they saw a crowd great around them, and scribes arguing with them.
41.9.15.1^and immediately all the crowd, having seen him, were greatly amazed, and running to him, were greeting him.
41.9.16.1^and he asked them, what are you disputing with them?
41.9.17.1^and answered him one out of the crowd, teacher, i brought the son of me to you, having a spirit mute;
41.9.18.1^and whenever if him it seizes, it throws down him;
41.9.18.2^and he foams, and gnashes - his teeth, and is withering away.
41.9.18.3^and i spoke to the disciples of you, that it they might cast out, and not they had power.
41.9.19.1^- and answering him, he says, o generation unbelieving!
41.9.19.2^until when with you will i be?
41.9.19.3^until when will i bear with you?
41.9.19.4^bring him to me.
41.9.20.1^and they brought him to him.
41.9.20.2^and having seen him, the spirit immediately threw into convulsions him, and having fallen upon the ground, he began rolling around, foaming.
41.9.21.1^and he asked the father of him, how long a time is it that this has been with him?
41.9.21.2^- and he said, from childhood.
41.9.22.1^and often both into fire him it casts, and into waters, that it might destroy him.
41.9.22.2^but if anything you are able to do, help us, having compassion on us.
41.9.23.1^- and jesus said to him, - if you are able?
41.9.23.2^all things are possible to the one believing.
41.9.24.1^immediately having cried out, the father of the child was saying, i believe;
41.9.24.2^help of me the unbelief!
41.9.25.1^having seen now - jesus that was running together a crowd, he rebuked the spirit - unclean, saying to it, - mute and deaf spirit, i command you, come out of him, and no more may you enter into him.
41.9.26.1^and having cried out, and much having thrown him into convulsions, it came out;
41.9.26.2^and he became as if dead, in order for - many to say that he was dead.
41.9.27.1^- and jesus, having taken by the hand him, raised up him, and he arose.
41.9.28.1^and having entered he into a house, the disciples of him in private were asking him, why we not were able to cast out it?
41.9.29.1^and he said to them, this - kind by nothing is able to go out, if not by prayer.
41.9.30.1^from there having gone forth, they were passing through - galilee;
41.9.30.2^and not did he want that anyone should know it;
41.9.31.1^he was teaching for the disciples of him, and he was saying to them -, the son - of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him;
41.9.31.2^and having been killed, on the third day he will arise.
41.9.32.1^- and they did not understand the saying, and they were afraid him to ask.
41.9.33.1^and they came to capernaum.
41.9.33.2^and in the house having been, he was asking them, what on the way were you discussing?
41.9.34.1^- and they were silent, with one another for they had been discussing along the road which was greatest.
41.9.35.1^and having sat down, he called the twelve, and he says to them, if anyone desires first to be, he will be of all last and of all servant.
41.9.36.1^and having taken a child, he set it in midst of them;
41.9.36.2^and having taken in his arms it, he said to them,
41.9.37.1^whoever - one - of such little children shall receive in the name of me, me receives;
41.9.37.2^and whoever - me shall receive, not me receives, but the one having sent me.
41.9.38.1^answered him - john, teacher, we saw someone in the name of you casting out demons, and we were forbidding him, because not he was following us.
41.9.39.1^- and jesus said, not forbid him.
41.9.39.2^no one for there is who will do a work of power in the name of me, and will be able readily to speak evil of me.
41.9.40.1^whoever for not is against us, for us is.
41.9.41.1^whoever for - might give to drink you a cup of water, in name because christ s you are, truly i say to you, that no not shall he lose the reward of him.
41.9.42.1^and whoever - might cause to stumble one of the little ones these - believing in me, better it is for him rather if is put a millstone heavy around the neck of him and he has been cast into the sea.
41.9.43.1^and if should cause to stumble you the hand of you, cut off it;
41.9.43.2^better it is for you crippled to enter into - life, than - two hands having, to go away into - hell, into the fire - unquenchable.
41.9.45.1^and if the foot of you should cause to stumble you, cut off it;
41.9.45.2^better it is for you to enter into - life lame, than the two feet having, to be cast into - hell.
41.9.47.1^and if the eye of you should cause to stumble you, cast out it;
41.9.47.2^better for you it is with one eye to enter into the kingdom - of god, than two eyes having to be cast into - hell,
41.9.48.1^where the worm of them not dies, and the fire not is quenched.
41.9.49.1^everyone for with fire will be salted.
41.9.50.1^good is the salt;
41.9.50.2^if however the salt unsalty becomes, with what it will you season?
41.9.50.3^have in yourselves salt, and be at peace with one another.
41.10.1.1^and from there having risen up, he comes into the region - of judea, and beyond the jordan.
41.10.1.2^and come together again crowds to him, and as he had been accustomed, again he was teaching them.
41.10.2.1^and having come to him, the pharisees were demanding of him if it is lawful for a husband a wife to divorce, testing him.
41.10.3.1^- and he answering, said to them, what you did command moses?
41.10.4.1^- and they said, permitted moses a roll of divorce to write, and to send her away.
41.10.5.1^- but jesus said to them, because of the hardness of heart of you, he wrote for you the commandment this.
41.10.6.1^from, however, the beginning of creation, male and female he made them.
41.10.7.1^on account of this, will leave a man the father of him and - mother and be joined to - wife his,
41.10.8.1^and will be the two for flesh one.
41.10.8.2^therefore no longer they are two, but one flesh.
41.10.9.1^what therefore - god has joined together, man not let separate.
41.10.10.1^and in the house again, the disciples concerning this were asking him.
41.10.11.1^and he says to them, whoever - shall divorce the wife of him, and shall marry another, commits adultery against her.
41.10.12.1^and if a woman, having divorced the husband of her, should marry another, she commits adultery.
41.10.13.1^and they were bringing to him little children, that them he might touch.
41.10.13.2^- but the disciples rebuked them.
41.10.14.1^having seen now, - jesus was indignant and said to them, permit the little children to come to me;
41.10.14.2^not do hinder them!
41.10.14.3^to the for such, belongs the kingdom - of god.
41.10.15.1^truly i say to you, whoever - not shall receive the kingdom - of god as a child, no not shall enter into it.
41.10.16.1^and having taken them in arms, them he was blessing, having laid the hands on them.
41.10.17.1^and going forth of him on the journey, having run up one and having knelt down to him, was asking him, teacher good, what shall i do, that life eternal i might inherit?
41.10.18.1^- and jesus said to him, why me call you good?
41.10.18.2^no one is good, if not alone - god.
41.10.19.1^the commandments you know:
41.10.19.2^not shall you murder, not shall you commit adultery, not shall you steal, not shall you bear false witness, not shall you defraud, you shall honor the father of you and the mother.
41.10.20.1^- and he was saying to him, teacher, these all i have kept from the youth of me.
41.10.21.1^- and jesus, having looked upon him, loved him and said to him, one thing to you is lacking.
41.10.21.2^go, as much as you have sell, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven;
41.10.21.3^and come, follow me.
41.10.22.1^- and having been sad at the word, he went away grieving;
41.10.22.2^he was one for having possessions many.
41.10.23.1^and having looked around, - jesus says the disciples of him, how difficultly those - riches having, into the kingdom - of god will enter!
41.10.24.1^- and the disciples were astonished at the words of him.
41.10.24.2^- but jesus, again answering, says to them, children, how difficult it is into the kingdom - of god to enter!
41.10.25.1^easier it is for a camel through the eye of the needle to pass, than for a rich man into the kingdom - of god to enter.
41.10.26.1^- and exceedingly they were astonished, saying among themselves, then who is able to be saved?
41.10.27.1^having looked on them, - jesus says, with men it is impossible, but not with god;
41.10.27.2^all things for are possible with - god.
41.10.28.1^began to say - peter to him, behold, we have left all and followed you.
41.10.29.1^was saying - jesus, truly i say to you, no one there is who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for the sake of me and because of the gospel,
41.10.30.1^if not shall take a hundredfold now in the time this   houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions   and in the age which is coming, life eternal.
41.10.31.1^many however will be first, last;
41.10.31.2^and the last, first.
41.10.32.1^they were then on the way, going up to jerusalem, and was going on before them - jesus, and they were astonished;
41.10.32.2^those then following were afraid.
41.10.32.3^and having taken to him again the twelve, he began them to tell the things being about to him to happen:
41.10.33.1^- behold, we go up to jerusalem, and the son - of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes, and they will condemn him to death, and will betray him to the gentiles.
41.10.34.1^and they will mock him, and will spit upon him, and will flog him, and will kill, and on the third day he will rise again.
41.10.35.1^and come up to him james and john, the sons of zebedee, saying to him, teacher, we desire that whatever if we might ask you, you would do for us.
41.10.36.1^- and he said to them, what do you desire me to do for you?
41.10.37.1^- and they said to him, grant to us that one of us at your right hand, and one at your left hand, we might sit in the glory of you.
41.10.38.1^- and jesus said to them, not you know what you ask.
41.10.38.2^are you able to drink the cup which i drink, and the baptism which i am baptized , to be baptized with?
41.10.39.1^- and they said to him, we are able.
41.10.39.2^- and jesus said to them, the cup which i drink, you will drink;
41.10.39.3^and the baptism which i am baptized , you will be baptized with;
41.10.40.1^- but to sit at the right hand of me or at the left hand, not is mine to give, but to those for whom it has been prepared.
41.10.41.1^and having heard this, the ten began to be indignant about james and john.
41.10.42.1^and having called near them, - jesus says to them, you know that those being accounted to rule over the gentiles exercise lordship over them;
41.10.42.2^and those great ones of them exercise authority over them.
41.10.43.1^not thus however shall it be among you.
41.10.43.2^instead, whoever - desires great to become among you, will be your servant;
41.10.44.1^and whoever - desires among you to become first, will be of all slave.
41.10.45.1^even for the son - of man not came to be served, but to serve, and to give the life of him as a ransom for many.
41.10.46.1^and they come to jericho.
41.10.46.2^and as was going out he from jericho   and the disciples of him, and a crowd large   the son of timaeus, bartimaeus, blind beggar, was sitting beside the road.
41.10.47.1^and having heard that jesus of nazareth it is, he began to cry out and to say, son of david, jesus, have mercy on me.
41.10.48.1^and were rebuking him many that he should be silent;
41.10.48.2^- but much more he kept crying out, son of david, have mercy on me.
41.10.49.1^and having stopped, - jesus commanded to be called him.
41.10.49.2^and they call the blind man, saying to him, take courage!
41.10.49.3^rise up!
41.10.49.4^he calls you.
41.10.50.1^- and having cast away the cloak of him, having risen up, he came to - jesus.
41.10.51.1^and answering him, - jesus says, what to you do you desire i should do?
41.10.51.2^- and the blind man said to him, rabboni, that i may receive sight.
41.10.52.1^and - jesus said to him, go, the faith of you has healed you.
41.10.52.2^and immediately he received sight, and he began following him on the way.
41.11.1.1^and when they drew near to jerusalem, to bethphage and bethany, near the mount - of olives, he sends two of the disciples of him
41.11.2.1^and says to them, go into the village, - before you, and immediately, entering into it, you will find a colt having been tied, upon which no one not yet of men has sat;
41.11.2.2^having untied it, also bring it.
41.11.3.1^and if anyone to you says, why are you doing this?
41.11.3.2^say, the lord of it need has, and soon it he will send back here.
41.11.4.1^and they departed and found the colt having been tied at the door outside, by the street, and they untied it.
41.11.5.1^and some of those there standing were saying to them, what are you doing untying the colt?
41.11.6.1^- and they spoke to them as had commanded - jesus, and they allowed them.
41.11.7.1^and they led the colt to - jesus, and they cast upon it the cloaks of them, and he sat on it.
41.11.8.1^and many the cloaks of them spread on the road;
41.11.8.2^others then, branches having been cut down from the fields.
41.11.9.1^and those going before and those following were crying out:
41.11.9.2^hosanna!
41.11.9.3^blessed is the one coming in the name of the lord!
41.11.10.1^blessed is the coming kingdom of the father of us, david!
41.11.10.2^hosanna in the highest!
41.11.11.1^and he entered into jerusalem, into the temple, and having looked around on all things, late already being the hour, he went out to bethany with the twelve.
41.11.12.1^and on the next day, having gone out they from bethany, he was hungry.
41.11.13.1^and having seen a fig tree from afar, having leaves, he went if perhaps anything he will find on it.
41.11.13.2^and having come to it, nothing he found, if not leaves;
41.11.13.3^the for season not it was of figs.
41.11.14.1^and answering, he said to it, no more to the age, of you no one fruit may eat.
41.11.14.2^and were listening the disciples of him.
41.11.15.1^and they come to jerusalem.
41.11.15.2^and having entered into the temple, he began to cast out those selling and those buying in the temple;
41.11.15.3^and the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling the doves he overturned.
41.11.16.1^and not he would permit that anyone should carry a vessel through the temple.
41.11.17.1^and he began teaching, and was saying to them, not has it been written -:
41.11.17.2^the house of me a house of prayer will be called for all the nations  you however have made it a den of robbers.
41.11.18.1^and heard it the chief priests and the scribes, and they were seeking how him they might destroy;
41.11.18.2^they were afraid of for him;
41.11.18.3^all for the crowd was astonished at the teaching of him.
41.11.19.1^and when evening came, they were going forth out of the city.
41.11.20.1^and passing by in the morning, they saw the fig tree having been dried up from the roots.
41.11.21.1^and having remembered, - peter says to him, rabbi, look, the fig tree that you cursed is dried up.
41.11.22.1^and answering, - jesus says to them, have faith from god.
41.11.23.1^truly i say to you that whoever - shall say to the mountain this, be you taken away and be you cast into the sea,  and not shall doubt in the heart of him, but shall believe that what he says takes place, it will be done for him.
41.11.24.1^because of this i say to you, all things whatever praying, also you ask, believe that you receive, and it will be to you.
41.11.25.1^and when you may stand praying, forgive if anything you have against anyone, so that also the father of you, who is in the heavens, might forgive you the trespasses of you.
41.11.27.1^and they come again to jerusalem.
41.11.27.2^and in the temple is walking as he, come to him the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
41.11.28.1^and they were saying to him, by what authority these things are you doing?
41.11.28.2^or, who you gave the authority this, that these things you should do?
41.11.29.1^- and jesus said to them, i will ask you one question, and you answer me, and i will tell you by what authority these things i do.
41.11.30.1^the baptism - of john, from heaven was it, or from men?
41.11.30.2^answer me.
41.11.31.1^and they began reasoning with themselves, saying, if we should say, from heaven, he will say, because of why then not did you believe him?
41.11.32.1^but should we say, from men.
41.11.32.2^.
41.11.32.3^.
41.11.32.4^they were afraid of the people;
41.11.32.5^all for were holding - john truly that a prophet he was.
41.11.33.1^and answering - to jesus, they say, not do we know.
41.11.33.2^and - jesus says to them, neither i tell you by what authority these things i do.
41.12.1.1^and he began to them in parables to speak:
41.12.1.2^a vineyard a man planted, and he placed around it a fence, and dug a wine vat, and built a tower, and rented out it to farmers, and traveled abroad.
41.12.2.1^and he sent to the farmers at the due time a servant, that from the farmers he might receive from the fruit of the vineyard.
41.12.3.1^but having taken him, they beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
41.12.4.1^and again he sent to them another servant, and him they struck on the head and treated shamefully.
41.12.5.1^and another he sent, and him they killed;
41.12.5.2^also many others, some indeed beating, some then killing.
41.12.6.1^yet one having son beloved, he sent him last to them, saying -, they will have respect for the son of me.
41.12.7.1^those however - farmers to themselves said -, this is the heir;
41.12.7.2^come, let us kill him, and ours will be the inheritance.
41.12.8.1^and having taken, they killed him and cast forth him outside the vineyard.
41.12.9.1^what therefore will do the master of the vineyard?
41.12.9.2^he will come and will destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.
41.12.10.1^not even the scripture this have you read:
41.12.10.2^the stone which rejected those building, this has become the chief corner;
41.12.11.1^from the lord was this, and it is marvelous in the eyes of us.
41.12.12.1^and they were seeking him to lay hold of, and they feared the crowd;
41.12.12.2^they knew for that against them the parable he had spoken.
41.12.12.3^and having left him, they went away.
41.12.13.1^and they send to him some of the pharisees, and of the herodians, that him they might catch in discourse.
41.12.14.1^and having come, they say to him, teacher, we know that true you are, and not there is care to you about no one;
41.12.14.2^not for you look on the appearance of men, but on the basis of the truth the way - of god teach.
41.12.14.3^is it lawful to give tribute to caesar or not?
41.12.14.4^should we pay or not pay?
41.12.15.1^- and knowing of them the hypocrisy, he said to them, why me do you test?
41.12.15.2^bring me a denarius, that i might see it.
41.12.16.1^- and they brought it.
41.12.16.2^and he says to them, whose is the likeness this, and the inscription?
41.12.16.3^- and they said to him, caesar s.
41.12.17.1^- and jesus said to them, the things of caesar, give back to caesar, and the things - of god, - to god.
41.12.17.2^and they were amazed at him.
41.12.18.1^and come sadducees to him, who say a resurrection not there is, and they began questioning him, saying,
41.12.19.1^teacher, moses wrote for us that if of anyone a brother should die, and leave behind a wife, and not leave children, that should take the brother of him the wife, and raise up seed for the brother of him.
41.12.20.1^seven brothers there were;
41.12.20.2^and the first took a wife, and, dying, not left seed.
41.12.21.1^and the second took her, and died, not having left seed;
41.12.21.2^and the third likewise.
41.12.22.1^and the seven not left seed.
41.12.22.2^last of all also, the woman died.
41.12.23.1^in the resurrection, when they rise, of which of them will she be wife?
41.12.23.2^- for the seven had her as wife.
41.12.24.1^was saying to them - jesus, not because of this do you err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power - of god?
41.12.25.1^when for out from the dead they rise, neither do they marry, nor are given in marriage;
41.12.25.2^but are like angels in the heavens.
41.12.26.1^concerning now the dead, that they rise, not have you read in the book of moses, on the bush, how spoke to him - god, saying, i am the god of abraham, and the god of isaac, and the god of jacob
41.12.27.1^not he is god of the dead, but of the living.
41.12.27.2^greatly you err.
41.12.28.1^and having come up one of the scribes, having heard them reasoning together, having seen that well he answered them, he questioned him, which is commandment the first of all?
41.12.29.1^answered - jesus, the foremost is, hear this o israel:
41.12.29.2^the lord - god of us, the lord one is,
41.12.30.1^and you shall love the lord - god of you with all the heart of you, and with all the soul of you, and with all the mind of you, and with all the strength of you.
41.12.31.1^the second this:
41.12.31.2^you shall love the neighbor of you as yourself.
41.12.31.3^greater than these another commandment not there is.
41.12.32.1^and said to him the scribe, right, teacher, according to truth you have spoken that one he is, and not there is another besides him,
41.12.33.1^and - to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength, and - to love the neighbor as oneself more important is than all the burnt offerings and sacrifices.
41.12.34.1^and - jesus, having seen him that wisely he answered, said to him, not far are you from the kingdom - of god.
41.12.34.2^and no one no longer dared him to question.
41.12.35.1^and answering, - jesus was saying, teaching in the temple, how say the scribes that the christ, the son of david is?
41.12.36.1^himself david said by the spirit - holy:
41.12.36.2^said the lord to the lord of me, sit at the right hand of me, until - i place of the enemies of you as a footstool of the feet of you.
41.12.37.1^himself david calls him lord, then how of him is he son?
41.12.37.2^and the great crowd was listening to him gladly.
41.12.38.1^and in the teaching of him, he was saying, beware of the scribes, - desiring in robes to walk about, and greetings in the marketplaces,
41.12.39.1^and first seats in the synagogues, and first places at the feasts;
41.12.40.1^those devouring the houses of the widows, and as a pretext, at great length praying.
41.12.40.2^these will receive greater judgment.
41.12.41.1^and having sat down opposite the treasury, he was watching how the crowd cast money into the treasury;
41.12.41.2^and many rich were casting in much.
41.12.42.1^and having come, one widow poor cast in lepta two, which is a kodrantes.
41.12.43.1^and having called to him the disciples of him, he says to them, truly i say to you that the widow this - poor, more than all has cast in of those casting into the treasury.
41.12.44.1^all for out of that which was abounding to them cast in;
41.12.44.2^she however, out of the poverty of her, all as much as she had cast in, all the livelihood of her.
41.13.1.1^and going forth of him out of the temple, says to him one of the disciples of him, teacher, behold what stones and what buildings!
41.13.2.1^and - jesus said to him, see you these - great buildings?
41.13.2.2^no not shall be left here stone upon stone, which no not shall be thrown down.
41.13.3.1^and sitting of him upon the mount - of olives, opposite the temple, asked him in private peter and james and john and andrew,
41.13.4.1^tell us when these things will be?
41.13.4.2^and what will be the sign when are going these things to be accomplished all?
41.13.5.1^- and jesus began to say to them, take heed, lest anyone you mislead.
41.13.6.1^many will come in the name of me, saying -, i am he, and many they will mislead.
41.13.7.1^when then you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars, not be disturbed;
41.13.7.2^it must come to pass, but not yet is the end.
41.13.8.1^will rise up for nation against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
41.13.8.2^there will be earthquakes throughout places;
41.13.8.3^there will be famines.
41.13.8.4^the beginning of birth pains are these.
41.13.9.1^take heed however you to yourselves;
41.13.9.2^they will betray you to courts and in synagogues;
41.13.9.3^you will be beaten, and before governors and kings you will stand because of me, for a testimony to them.
41.13.10.1^and to all the nations first it behooves to proclaim the gospel.
41.13.11.1^and when they might lead away you, delivering you up, not be anxious beforehand what you should say, but whatever if might be given to you, in that - hour, that speak;
41.13.11.2^not for are you those speaking, but the spirit - holy.
41.13.12.1^and will deliver up brother, brother to death, and father, child;
41.13.12.2^and will rise up children against parents, and will put to death them.
41.13.13.1^and you will be hated by all on account of the name of me;
41.13.13.2^the one however having endured to the end, he will be saved.
41.13.14.1^when then you see the abomination of the desolation standing where not it should   the one reading, let him understand   then those in - judea, let them flee to the mountains,
41.13.15.1^the one and upon the housetop, not let him come down, nor go in to take anything out of the house of him;
41.13.16.1^and the one in the field, not let him return to the things behind, to take the clothing of him.
41.13.17.1^woe then to those in womb having, and to the ones nursing infants in those - days!
41.13.18.1^pray then that it not might be in winter;
41.13.19.1^will be in for the days those tribulation, such as never has been the like, from the beginning of creation, which created - god, until - now   and never not shall be.
41.13.20.1^and if not had shortened the lord the days, no - there would have been saved any flesh;
41.13.20.2^but on account of the elect whom he chose, he has shortened the days.
41.13.21.1^and then if anyone to you says, behold, here is the christ!
41.13.21.2^behold, there!
41.13.21.3^not you shall believe it.
41.13.22.1^there will arise for false christs and false prophets, and will give signs and wonders, so as - to deceive if possible, the elect.
41.13.23.1^you however take heed;
41.13.23.2^i have foretold to you all things.
41.13.24.1^but in those - days, after the tribulation those, the sun will be darkened, and the moon not will give the light of it;
41.13.25.1^and the stars will be out of the heaven falling, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.
41.13.26.1^and then will they see the son - of man coming in the clouds, with power great and glory.
41.13.27.1^and then he will send the angels, and will gather together the elect of him, from the four winds, from the end of earth to the end of heaven.
41.13.28.1^of now the fig tree, learn the parable:
41.13.28.2^when already the branch of it tender has become, and it puts forth the leaves, you know that near the summer is.
41.13.29.1^so also you, when you see these things coming to pass, know that near he is, at the doors.
41.13.30.1^truly i say to you that no not will have passed away the generation this until that these things all shall have taken place.
41.13.31.1^the heaven and the earth will pass away, - but the words of me in no way not will pass away.
41.13.32.1^concerning now the day that, or the hour, no one knows;
41.13.32.2^not even the angels in heaven, nor the son, if not the father.
41.13.33.1^take heed;
41.13.33.2^watch;
41.13.33.3^not you know for when the time is.
41.13.34.1^it is like a man going on a journey, having left the house of him, and having given the servants of him - authority, to each one the work of him.
41.13.34.2^and the doorkeeper he commanded that he should keep watch.
41.13.35.1^watch therefore   not you know for when the master of the house comes, or at evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or morning
41.13.36.1^lest having come suddenly, he should find you sleeping.
41.13.37.1^what now to you i say, to all i say:
41.13.37.2^watch!
41.14.1.1^it would be now the passover and the feast of unleavened bread, after two days.
41.14.1.2^and were seeking the chief priests and the scribes how, him by stealth having taken, they might kill him.
41.14.2.1^they were saying for, not during the feast, lest ever there will be an uproar of the people.
41.14.3.1^and being of him in bethany in the house of simon the leper, having reclined of him, came a woman having an alabaster flask of fragrant oil of nard pure of great price;
41.14.3.2^having broken the alabaster flask, she poured it on his - head.
41.14.4.1^were now some indignant within themselves:
41.14.4.2^to what the waste this of the fragrant oil has been made?
41.14.5.1^could for this - fragrant oil to have been sold for above denarii three hundred, and to have been given to the poor.
41.14.5.2^and they were grumbling at her.
41.14.6.1^- and jesus said, leave alone her;
41.14.6.2^why to her trouble do you cause?
41.14.6.3^a good work she did toward me.
41.14.7.1^always for the poor you have with you, and whenever you desire you are able them good to do;
41.14.7.2^me however not always do you have.
41.14.8.1^what she could, she did.
41.14.8.2^she came beforehand to anoint the body of me for the burial.
41.14.9.1^truly now i say to you, wherever if shall be proclaimed the gospel in whole the world, also what has done this woman will be spoken of for a memorial of her.
41.14.10.1^and judas iscariot, - one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that him he might betray to them.
41.14.11.1^- and having heard, they rejoiced, and promised him money to give.
41.14.11.2^and he was seeking how him conveniently he might deliver up.
41.14.12.1^and on the first day - of unleavened bread, when the passover lamb they were to sacrifice, say to him the disciples of him, where do you desire that, having gone, we should prepare that you may eat the passover?
41.14.13.1^and he sends forth two of the disciples of him and says to them, go into the city, and will meet you a man, a pitcher of water carrying.
41.14.13.2^follow him.
41.14.14.1^and wherever if he might enter, say to the master of the house that the teacher says, where is the guest room of me, where the passover with the disciples of me i may eat?
41.14.15.1^and he you will show an upper room large, having been furnished and ready.
41.14.15.2^and there prepare for us.
41.14.16.1^and went away - his disciples, and came into the city, and found as he had said to them, and they prepared the passover.
41.14.17.1^and evening having arrived, he comes with the twelve.
41.14.18.1^and as were reclining they, and were eating, - jesus said, truly i say to you that one of you will betray me, who is eating with me.
41.14.19.1^they began to be grieved and to say to him one by one, surely not i?
41.14.20.1^- and he said to them, it is one of the twelve, who is dipping with me in the bowl.
41.14.21.1^for - indeed the son - of man goes as it has been written concerning him;
41.14.21.2^woe however to the man that by whom the son - of man is betrayed;
41.14.21.3^better for him it were if not had been born the man that.
41.14.22.1^and they were eating of them, having taken bread, having spoken a blessing, he broke, and gave to them, and said, take;
41.14.22.2^this is the body of me.
41.14.23.1^and having taken the cup, having given thanks, he gave it to them, and they drank of it all.
41.14.24.1^and he said to them, this is the blood of me of the covenant, which is being poured out for many.
41.14.25.1^truly i say to you that no more never not will i drink of the fruit of the vine, until the day that when it i drink anew in the kingdom - of god.
41.14.26.1^and having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount - of olives.
41.14.27.1^and says to them - jesus -, all you will fall away, for it has been written:
41.14.27.2^i will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.
41.14.28.1^but after - having arisen, i will go before you into - galilee.
41.14.29.1^- and peter was saying to him, if even all will fall away, yet not i.
41.14.30.1^and says to him - jesus, truly i say to you that yourself now this - night, before that twice the rooster crows, three times me you will deny.
41.14.31.1^- and emphatically he kept saying, if it is needful of me to die with you, no not you will i deny.
41.14.31.2^likewise now also all of them were saying.
41.14.32.1^and they come to a place, of which the name is gethsemane;
41.14.32.2^and he says to the disciples of him, sit here, while i shall pray.
41.14.33.1^and he takes - peter and - james and - john with him;
41.14.33.2^and he began to be greatly awe-struck and deeply distressed.
41.14.34.1^and he says to them, very sorrowful is the soul of me, even to death;
41.14.34.2^remain here and watch.
41.14.35.1^and having gone forward a little, he fell upon the ground and was praying that, if possible it is, might pass from him the hour.
41.14.36.1^and he was saying, abba, - father, all things are possible to you;
41.14.36.2^take away the cup this from me;
41.14.36.3^but not what i will, but what you.
41.14.37.1^and he comes and finds them sleeping.
41.14.37.2^and he says - to peter, simon, are you asleep?
41.14.37.3^not were you able one hour to watch?
41.14.38.1^watch and pray, so that not you may enter into temptation.
41.14.38.2^the indeed spirit is willing, - but the flesh weak.
41.14.39.1^and again having gone away, he prayed, the same thing having said.
41.14.40.1^and again having returned, he found them sleeping.
41.14.40.2^were for of them the eyes heavy;
41.14.40.3^and not they knew what they should answer him.
41.14.41.1^and he comes the third time, and says to them, are you sleeping - still and taking your rest.
41.14.41.2^it is enough;
41.14.41.3^has come the hour;
41.14.41.4^behold, is delivered up the son - of man into the hands of the sinful.
41.14.42.1^rise, let us go;
41.14.42.2^behold, the one betraying me has drawn near!
41.14.43.1^and immediately while yet of him speaking, comes up judas, one of the twelve, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
41.14.44.1^had given then the one delivering up him a sign to them, saying:
41.14.44.2^whomever - i shall kiss, he is;
41.14.44.3^seize him and lead him away securely.
41.14.45.1^and having arrived, immediately having come up to him, he says, rabbi!
41.14.45.2^and he kissed him.
41.14.46.1^- and they laid the hands on him and seized him.
41.14.47.1^one then, a certain of those standing by, having drawn the sword, struck the servant of the high priest and cut off of him the ear.
41.14.48.1^and answering, - jesus said to them, as against a robber are you come out with swords and clubs to capture me?
41.14.49.1^every day i was with you in the temple teaching, and not you did seize me.
41.14.49.2^but it is that may be fulfilled the scriptures.
41.14.50.1^and having left him, fled all.
41.14.51.1^and a young man certain was following him, having cast a linen cloth about his naked body;
41.14.51.2^and they seize him,
41.14.52.1^- and having left behind the linen cloth, naked he fled.
41.14.53.1^and they led away - jesus to the high priest.
41.14.53.2^and come together all the chief priests, and the elders, and the scribes.
41.14.54.1^and - peter from afar off followed him, as far as within to the court of the high priest;
41.14.54.2^and he was sitting with the officers and warming himself at the fire.
41.14.55.1^- and the chief priests and all the council were seeking against - jesus testimony, to - put to death him, but not they were finding any.
41.14.56.1^many for were bearing false testimony against him, but alike their testimonies not were.
41.14.57.1^and some having risen up, were bearing false testimony against him, saying,
41.14.58.1^- we heard him saying -, i will destroy the temple this, the one made with hands, and in three days another, not made with hands, i will build.
41.14.59.1^and neither thus alike was the testimony of them.
41.14.60.1^and having stood up the high priest in the midst, he questioned - jesus, saying, not answer you nothing?
41.14.60.2^what is it these you testify against?
41.14.61.1^- but he was silent, and not did he answer nothing.
41.14.61.2^again the high priest was questioning him, and says to him, you are the christ, the son of the blessed one?
41.14.62.1^- and jesus said, i am.
41.14.62.2^and you will see the son - of man at the right hand sitting of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.
41.14.63.1^- and the high priest, having torn the garments of him, says, what any more need have we of witnesses?
41.14.64.1^you heard the blasphemy.
41.14.64.2^what to you does it appear?
41.14.64.3^- and all condemned him deserving to be of death.
41.14.65.1^and began some to spit upon him, and to cover up of him the face, and to strike him, and to say to him, prophesy!
41.14.65.2^and the officers with the palms him received.
41.14.66.1^and being - peter below in the courtyard, comes one of the servant girls of the high priest,
41.14.67.1^and having seen - peter warming himself, having looked at him, she says, also you with the nazarene were, - jesus.
41.14.68.1^- but he denied it, saying, neither i know, nor even understand you what say.
41.14.68.2^and he went forth out into the porch;
41.14.68.3^and the rooster crowed.
41.14.69.1^and the servant girl, having seen him, began again to say to those standing by -, this one of them is.
41.14.70.1^- but again he denied.
41.14.70.2^and after a little, again those standing by were saying - to peter, truly of them you are, also for a galilean you are.
41.14.71.1^- but he began to curse and to swear -, not i know the man this, whom you speak of!
41.14.72.1^and immediately for the second time a rooster crowed.
41.14.72.2^and remembered - peter the word that had said to him - jesus -, before the rooster crows, twice three times me you will deny.
41.14.72.3^and having broken down, he began to weep.
41.15.1.1^and early in the morning, a counsel having formed the chief priests, with the elders, and scribes, and all the council, having bound - jesus, they led him away and delivered him to pilate.
41.15.2.1^and questioned him - pilate, you are the king of the jews?
41.15.2.2^- and answering to him, he says, you have said.
41.15.3.1^and were accusing him the chief priests of many things.
41.15.4.1^- and pilate again began to question him, saying, not answer you nothing?
41.15.4.2^see how many things you they testify against!
41.15.5.1^- but jesus no longer nothing answered, so as to amaze - pilate.
41.15.6.1^at then the feast, he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they requested.
41.15.7.1^there was then the one called barabbas, with the rebels having been bound, who in the insurrection murder had committed.
41.15.8.1^and having cried out, the crowd began to beg him to do as usually he did for them.
41.15.9.1^- but pilate answered them, saying, wish you that i should release to you the king of the jews?
41.15.10.1^he was aware for that because of envy had delivered up him the chief priests.
41.15.11.1^- but the chief priests stirred up the crowd so that instead - barabbas he might release to them.
41.15.12.1^- and pilate again answering, was saying to them, what then do you wish that i should do to him you call the king of the jews?
41.15.13.1^- and again they cried out, crucify him!
41.15.14.1^- and pilate was saying to them, what indeed did he commit evil?
41.15.14.2^- but much more they shouted, crucify him!
41.15.15.1^- and pilate, desiring to the crowd that which was satisfactory to do, released to them - barabbas, and he delivered - jesus, having flogged him, that he might be crucified.
41.15.16.1^- and the soldiers led away him into the palace, that is the praetorium, and they call together all the cohort.
41.15.17.1^and they put on him purple, and placed on him, having twisted together of thorns a crown,
41.15.18.1^and they began to salute him, hail, king of the jews!
41.15.19.1^and they kept striking his - head with a reed, and spitting on him;
41.15.19.2^and, bending the knees, they were kneeling down to him.
41.15.20.1^and when they had mocked him, they took off him the purple and put on him the garments his and they are leading out him, that they might crucify him.
41.15.21.1^and they compel, passing by one, simon of cyrene, coming from the country, the father of alexander and rufus, that he might carry the cross of him.
41.15.22.1^and they bring him to - golgotha, a place which is translated, of a skull place.
41.15.23.1^and they were offering him, having been mixed with myrrh, wine;
41.15.23.2^he however not did take it.
41.15.24.1^and having crucified him, also they divided the garments of him, casting lots for them, who what should take.
41.15.25.1^it was then the hour third, and they crucified him.
41.15.26.1^and there was the inscription of the accusation against him having been written:
41.15.26.2^the king of the jews.
41.15.27.1^and with him they crucify two robbers, one at the right hand, and one at the left of him.
41.15.29.1^and those passing by were railing at him, shaking the heads of them and saying, aha!
41.15.29.2^the one destroying the temple and building it in three days,
41.15.30.1^save yourself, having descended from the cross!
41.15.31.1^likewise also the chief priests, mocking among one another, with the scribes, were saying, others he saved;
41.15.31.2^himself not he is able to save.
41.15.32.1^the christ, the king of israel, let him descend now from the cross, that we might see and believe!
41.15.32.2^and those being crucified with him were upbraiding him.
41.15.33.1^and having arrived the hour sixth, darkness came over all the land, until the hour ninth.
41.15.34.1^and at the ninth hour, cried out - jesus in a voice loud, eloi, eloi, lema sabachthani?
41.15.34.2^which is translated, - god of me, - god of me, to why have you forsaken me?
41.15.35.1^and some of those standing by, having heard, were saying, behold, elijah he calls.
41.15.36.1^having run then one and having filled a sponge with vinegar, having put it on a reed, gave to drink him, saying, let be;
41.15.36.2^let us see if comes elijah to take down him.
41.15.37.1^- but jesus, having uttered a cry loud, breathed his last.
41.15.38.1^and the veil of the temple was torn into two from top to bottom.
41.15.39.1^having seen then the centurion - standing from opposite of him that thus he breathed his last, he said, truly this - man the son of god was!
41.15.40.1^there were then also women from afar off looking on, among whom also mary - magdalene, and mary the of james the least and of joseph mother, and salome,
41.15.41.1^who, when he was in - galilee, had been following him and had been ministering to him, and other many, those having come up with him to jerusalem.
41.15.42.1^and already evening having arrived, since it was the preparation, that is, the day before sabbath,
41.15.43.1^having come, joseph - from arimathea, a prominent council member, who also himself was waiting for the kingdom - of god, having boldness, went in to - pilate and asked for the body - of jesus.
41.15.44.1^- and pilate wondered if already he were dead.
41.15.44.2^and having called to him the centurion, he questioned him whether already he had died.
41.15.45.1^and having known it from the centurion, he granted the body - to joseph.
41.15.46.1^and having bought a linen cloth, having taken down him, he wrapped him in the linen cloth and laid him in a tomb which was cut out of a rock.
41.15.46.2^and he rolled a stone to the door of the tomb.
41.15.47.1^- and mary - magdalene and mary the mother of joseph were watching where he was laid.
41.16.1.1^and having passed the sabbath, mary - magdalene, and mary the mother - of james, and salome, bought spices, that having come, they might anoint him.
41.16.2.1^and very early on the first day of the week, they come to the tomb, having arisen the sun.
41.16.3.1^and they were saying among themselves, who will roll away for us the stone from the door of the tomb?
41.16.4.1^and having looked up they see that has been rolled away the stone;
41.16.4.2^it was for large extremely.
41.16.5.1^and having entered into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right, clothed in a robe white, and they were greatly amazed.
41.16.6.1^- and he says to them, not be amazed.
41.16.6.2^jesus you seek, the nazarene, the one having been crucified.
41.16.6.3^he is risen!
41.16.6.4^not he is here!
41.16.6.5^behold the place where they laid him.
41.16.7.1^but go, say the disciples of him and - to peter that he goes before you into - galilee;
41.16.7.2^there him will you see, as he said to you.
41.16.8.1^and having gone out, they fled from the tomb.
41.16.8.2^had seized for them trembling and amazement, and to none nothing they spoke;
41.16.8.3^they were afraid for.
41.16.9.1^having risen now early the first day of the week, he appeared first to mary - magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.
41.16.10.1^she having gone, told it to those with him, having been mourning and weeping.
41.16.11.1^and they, having heard that he is alive and has been seen by her, disbelieved.
41.16.12.1^after now these things, to two of them as they are walking, he appeared in another form, going into the country.
41.16.13.1^and they, having gone, told it to the rest;
41.16.13.2^neither them did they believe.
41.16.14.1^afterward now were reclining they;
41.16.14.2^to the eleven he appeared and rebuked the unbelief of them and hardness of heart, because those having seen him arisen not they believed.
41.16.15.1^and he said to them, having gone into the world all, proclaim the gospel to all the creation.
41.16.16.1^the one having believed and having been baptized will be saved;
41.16.16.2^the one however having disbelieved will be condemned.
41.16.17.1^signs now those having believed these will accompany:
41.16.17.2^in the name of me demons they will cast out;
41.16.17.3^with tongues they will speak new;
41.16.18.1^and with their hands serpents they will take up;
41.16.18.2^and if deadly anything they drink, no not them shall it hurt;
41.16.18.3^upon the sick, hands they will lay, and well they will be.
41.16.19.1^- indeed therefore the lord jesus, after - speaking to them, was taken up into the heaven and sat at the right hand - of god.
41.16.20.1^they now having gone forth, preached everywhere, the lord working with them and the word confirming by the accompanying signs.
41.16.20.2^all moreover the things being instructed to those around - peter.
41.16.20.3^promptly they reported after moreover, these, also himself - jesus from the east and to the west, sent out through them, the sacred and imperishable preaching of eternal salvation.
41.16.20.4^amen.
42.1.1.1^inasmuch as many have undertaken to draw up a narration concerning the having been accomplished among us things,
42.1.2.1^as delivered them to us those from the beginning eyewitnesses and servants having been of the word,
42.1.3.1^it seemed good also to me, having been acquainted from the first with all things, carefully with method to you to write, most excellent theophilus,
42.1.4.1^so that you may know concerning which you were instructed, of the things, the certainty.
42.1.5.1^there was in the days of herod king - of judea a priest certain, named zechariah, of the division of abijah, and wife of him of the daughters of aaron, and the name of her elizabeth.
42.1.6.1^they were now righteous both before - god, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless.
42.1.7.1^and no there was to them child, inasmuch as was - elizabeth barren, and both advanced in the years of them were.
42.1.8.1^it came to pass now in the fulfilling the priestly service of him, in the order of the division of him before - god,
42.1.9.1^according to the custom of the priesthood, it fell to him by lot - to burn incense, having entered into the temple of the lord.
42.1.10.1^and all the multitude were of the people praying outside at the hour of the incense.
42.1.11.1^appeared then to him an angel of the lord, standing at the right of the altar of the incense.
42.1.12.1^and was troubled zechariah having seen him, and fear fell upon him.
42.1.13.1^said then to him the angel, not fear, zechariah, because has been heard the prayer of you, and the wife of you elizabeth will bear a son to you, and you shall call the name of him john.
42.1.14.1^and he will be joy to you and gladness, and many at the birth of him will rejoice.
42.1.15.1^he will be for great before the lord;
42.1.15.2^and wine and strong drink no not shall he drink, and of the spirit holy he will be filled even from the womb of the mother of him.
42.1.16.1^and many of the sons of israel he will turn to the lord, the god of them.
42.1.17.1^and he will go forth before him in the spirit and power of elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, to make ready for the lord a people prepared.
42.1.18.1^and said zechariah to the angel, by what will i know this?
42.1.18.2^i for am an old man, and the wife of me is advanced in the years of her.
42.1.19.1^and answering, the angel said to him, i am gabriel, the one standing before - god, and i was sent to speak to you, and to bring glad tidings to you these.
42.1.20.1^and behold, you will be silent, and not able to speak until that day shall take place these things, in return for that not you did believe the words of me, which will be fulfilled in the season of them.
42.1.21.1^and were the people expecting - zechariah, and they were wondering at the delaying in the temple of him.
42.1.22.1^having come out then, not he was able to speak to them, and they recognized that a vision he had seen in the temple.
42.1.22.2^and he was making signs to them, and remained mute.
42.1.23.1^and it came to pass, when were fulfilled the days of the service of him, he departed to the home of him.
42.1.24.1^after then these - days conceived elizabeth the wife of him, and hid herself months five, saying,
42.1.25.1^- thus to me has done the lord, in the days in which he looked upon me, to take away the disgrace of me among men.
42.1.26.1^in now the month - sixth, was sent the angel gabriel by - god to a city - of galilee, whose name was nazareth,
42.1.27.1^to a virgin betrothed to a man, whose name was joseph, of the house of david;
42.1.27.2^and the name of the virgin was mary.
42.1.28.1^and having come to her, he said, greetings, you favored with grace!
42.1.28.2^the lord is with you.
42.1.29.1^- and at the statement she was troubled, and was pondering what kind might be the salutation this.
42.1.30.1^and said the angel to her, not fear, mary;
42.1.30.2^you have found for favor with - god;
42.1.31.1^and behold, you will conceive in womb, and will bring forth a son, and you shall call the name of him jesus.
42.1.32.1^he will be great, and son of the most high he will be called;
42.1.32.2^and will give him the lord - god the throne of david, of the father of him;
42.1.33.1^and he will reign over the house of jacob to the ages;
42.1.33.2^and of the kingdom of him not there will be an end!
42.1.34.1^said then mary to the angel, how will be this, since a man not i know?
42.1.35.1^and answering, the angel said to her, the spirit holy will come upon you, and power of the most high will overshadow you;
42.1.35.2^therefore also the being born holy one will be called the son of god.
42.1.36.1^and behold, elizabeth, the relative of you, also she has conceived a son in old age her, and this month the sixth is to her who was called barren.
42.1.37.1^for not will be impossible with - god every thing.
42.1.38.1^said then mary, behold, the handmaid of the lord.
42.1.38.2^may it happen to me according to the word of you.
42.1.38.3^and departed from her the angel.
42.1.39.1^having risen up then mary in the days this, she went into the hill country with haste, to a town of judah,
42.1.40.1^and she entered into the house of zechariah and greeted - elizabeth.
42.1.41.1^and it came to pass, as heard the greeting - of mary - elizabeth, leaped the baby in the womb of her;
42.1.41.2^and was filled with the spirit holy - elizabeth,
42.1.42.1^and she cried out in a voice loud and said, blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of the womb of you.
42.1.43.1^and from where to me this, that should come the mother of the lord of me to me?
42.1.44.1^behold for, as came the voice of the greeting of you into the ears of me, leaped in exultation the baby in the womb of me.
42.1.45.1^and blessed is the one having believed that there will be a fulfillment to the things spoken to her from the lord.
42.1.46.1^and said mary:
42.1.46.2^magnifies the soul of me the lord,
42.1.47.1^and rejoices the spirit of me in - god, the savior of me.
42.1.48.1^for he has looked upon the humiliation of the handmaiden of him.
42.1.48.2^behold for from - henceforth will count blessed me all the generations.
42.1.49.1^for has done to me great things the mighty one.
42.1.49.2^and holy is the name of him.
42.1.50.1^and the mercy of him is to generations and generations, to those fearing him.
42.1.51.1^he has shown strength with the arm of him, he has scattered the proud in the thought of heart of them.
42.1.52.1^he has brought down rulers from thrones, and exalted the humble.
42.1.53.1^those hungering he has filled with good things, and those being rich he has sent away empty.
42.1.54.1^he has helped israel the servant of him, remembering mercy,
42.1.55.1^as he spoke to the fathers of us, - to abraham and to the descendants of him to the age.
42.1.56.1^dwelt then mary with her about months three, and returned to the home of her.
42.1.57.1^to now elizabeth was fulfilled the time - to give birth for her, and she bore a son.
42.1.58.1^and heard the neighbors and - relatives of her that was magnifying the lord the mercy of him with her, and they were rejoicing with her.
42.1.59.1^and it came to pass on - day the eighth, they came to circumcise the child, and were calling it after the name of the father of him, zechariah.
42.1.60.1^and answering, the mother of him said, no, but he will be called john.
42.1.61.1^and they said to her -, no one is among the relatives of you, who is called the name by this.
42.1.62.1^they were making signs then to the father of him, the what - he might wish to be called him.
42.1.63.1^and having asked for a writing tablet, he wrote, saying, john is the name of him.
42.1.63.2^and they marveled all.
42.1.64.1^was opened then the mouth of him immediately, and the tongue of him, and he was speaking, blessing - god.
42.1.65.1^and came upon all fear, those dwelling around them;
42.1.65.2^and in all the hill country - of judea were being talked about all the things, words these.
42.1.66.1^and laid them up all those having heard, in the heart of them, saying, what then the child this will be?
42.1.66.2^and for the hand of the lord was with him.
42.1.67.1^and zechariah, the father of him, was filled with the spirit holy, and prophesied, saying,
42.1.68.1^blessed be the lord the god - of israel, because he has visited and has performed redemption on the people of him,
42.1.69.1^and has raised up a horn of salvation for us, in the house of david of the servant of him;
42.1.70.1^as he spoke by the mouth of the holy of old prophets of him,
42.1.71.1^salvation from the enemies of us, and from the hand of all those hating us;
42.1.72.1^to fulfill mercy toward the fathers of us, and to remember the covenant holy of him,
42.1.73.1^the oath that he swore to abraham, the father of us, - to grant us,
42.1.74.1^without fear, from the hand of our enemies having been saved, to serve him,
42.1.75.1^in holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.
42.1.76.1^and you now, child, prophet of the most high will be called;
42.1.76.2^you will go for before the lord, to prepare ways of him;
42.1.77.1^- to give knowledge of salvation to people of him, in forgiveness of the sins of them,
42.1.78.1^through the affections of compassion of god of us, in which will visit us the sunrise from on high,
42.1.79.1^to shine upon those in darkness and in the shadow of death sitting;
42.1.79.2^- to direct the feet of us into the way of peace.
42.1.80.1^- and the child continued to grow and was strengthened in spirit;
42.1.80.2^and he was in the deserted places until the day of appearance of him to - israel.
42.2.1.1^it came to pass then in the days those, went out a decree from caesar augustus to register all the world.
42.2.2.1^this registration first took place when was governing - syria quirinius.
42.2.3.1^and were going all to be registered, each to the of themselves city.
42.2.4.1^went up then also joseph, from - galilee out of the town of nazareth, to - judea, to the city of david, which is called bethlehem, because of - being his of the house and family of david,
42.2.5.1^to register with mary, the one being betrothed to him, she being with child.
42.2.6.1^it came to pass then in their being - there, were fulfilled the days of the giving birth of her.
42.2.7.1^and she brought forth the son of her, the firstborn, and wrapped in swaddling cloths him, and laid him in a manger, because not there was for them a place in the inn.
42.2.8.1^and shepherds were in the region - same, lodging in the fields and keeping watch - by night over the flock of them.
42.2.9.1^and an angel of the lord stood by them, and the glory of the lord shone around them, and they feared with fear great.
42.2.10.1^and said to them the angel, not fear;
42.2.10.2^behold, for i bring good news to you of joy great, which will be to all the people.
42.2.11.1^for has been born to you today a savior, who is christ the lord, in the city of david.
42.2.12.1^and this is to you the sign:
42.2.12.2^you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths, and lying in a manger.
42.2.13.1^and suddenly there came with the angel a multitude of the host heavenly, praising - god and saying:
42.2.14.1^glory in the highest to god, and on earth peace among men with whom he is pleased!
42.2.15.1^and it came to pass, as were departing from them into the heaven the angels, the shepherds were saying to one another, let us go through indeed as far as bethlehem, and let us see the word this that has come to pass, which the lord has made known to us.
42.2.16.1^and they came having hurried, and found - both mary and - joseph, and the baby, lying in the manger.
42.2.17.1^having seen now, they proclaimed abroad concerning the saying - having been told them concerning the child this.
42.2.18.1^and all those having heard marveled concerning the things having been spoken by the shepherds to them.
42.2.19.1^- but mary all was treasuring up - matters these, pondering them in the heart of her.
42.2.20.1^and returned the shepherds, glorifying and praising - god for all things which they had heard and seen, as it was said to them.
42.2.21.1^and when were fulfilled days eight - to circumcise him, then was called the name of him jesus, which he had been called by the angel before - was conceived he in the womb.
42.2.22.1^and when were fulfilled the days of the purification of them according to the law of moses, they brought him to jerusalem, to present to the lord
42.2.23.1^as it has been written in the law of the lord -:
42.2.23.2^every male opening a womb holy to the lord shall be called,
42.2.24.1^and - to offer a sacrifice, according to that having been said in the law of the lord, a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons.
42.2.25.1^and behold, a man there was in jerusalem, whose name was simeon;
42.2.25.2^and the man this was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation - of israel, and the spirit was holy upon him.
42.2.26.1^and it was to him divinely revealed by the spirit - holy not to see death before that - he should see the christ of the lord.
42.2.27.1^and he came in the spirit into the temple;
42.2.27.2^and in the time when were bringing in the parents the child jesus, the thing were doing they according to that having become customary by the law for him,
42.2.28.1^then he received him into the arms, and blessed - god, and said:
42.2.29.1^now you dismiss the servant of you, lord, according to the word of you, in peace;
42.2.30.1^for have seen the eyes of me the salvation of you,
42.2.31.1^which you have prepared before the face of all the peoples,
42.2.32.1^a light for revelation of the gentiles, and glory of the people of you, israel.
42.2.33.1^and were the father of him, and the mother, marveling at the things having been spoken concerning him.
42.2.34.1^and blessed them simeon, and said to mary the mother of him:
42.2.34.2^behold, this child is appointed for the falling and rising up of many in - israel, and for a sign spoken against
42.2.35.1^and of you also of her the soul will go through a sword   so that - may be revealed of many hearts the thoughts.
42.2.36.1^and there was anna, a prophetess, daughter of phanuel, of the tribe of asher, she being advanced in years great, having lived with a husband years seven from the marriage of herself,
42.2.37.1^and she was a widow of about years eighty and four, who not departed the temple, with fastings and prayers serving night and day.
42.2.38.1^and she at that hour having come up, was giving praise - to god, and was speaking concerning him to all those waiting for the redemption of jerusalem.
42.2.39.1^and when they had performed everything - according to the law of the lord, they returned to - galilee, to the town of them, nazareth.
42.2.40.1^- and the child continued to grow and become strong, being filled with wisdom, and the grace of god was upon him.
42.2.41.1^and were going the parents of him every year to jerusalem at the feast of the passover.
42.2.42.1^and when he was years old twelve, having gone up they according to the custom of the feast,
42.2.43.1^and having completed the days, in the returning of them, remained behind jesus the boy in jerusalem.
42.2.43.2^but not knew the parents of him.
42.2.44.1^having supposed now him to be in their company, they went a day s journey, and began seeking him among the relatives and the acquaintances;
42.2.45.1^and not having found him, they returned to jerusalem, seeking him.
42.2.46.1^and it came to pass after days three, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them and questioning them.
42.2.47.1^were amazed then all those hearing him at the understanding and the answers of him.
42.2.48.1^and having seen him, they were astonished, and said to him the mother of him, child why have you done to us thus?
42.2.48.2^behold, the father of you, and i, distressing were seeking you.
42.2.49.1^and he said to them, why is it that you were seeking me?
42.2.49.2^not knew you that in the house of the father of me it behooves to be me?
42.2.50.1^and they not understood the word that he spoke to them.
42.2.51.1^and he went down with them and came to nazareth, and he was subject to them.
42.2.51.2^and the mother of him was treasuring up all the these matters in the heart of her.
42.2.52.1^and jesus continued to advance in - wisdom and stature, and in favor with god and men.
42.3.1.1^in year then fifteenth of the reign of tiberius caesar, being governor pontius pilate - of judea, and being tetrarch - of galilee herod, philip now the brother of him being tetrarch - of ituraea and of trachonitis the region, and lysanias - of abilene being tetrarch,
42.3.2.1^during the high priesthood of annas and caiaphas, came the word of god upon john, - of zechariah son, in the wilderness.
42.3.3.1^and he went into all the surrounding region of the jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins,
42.3.4.1^as it has been written in the book of the words of isaiah the prophet:
42.3.4.2^the voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of the lord;
42.3.4.3^straight make the paths of him.
42.3.5.1^every valley will be filled, and every mountain and hill will be made low;
42.3.5.2^and will become the crooked into straight, and the rough into ways smooth;
42.3.6.1^and will see all flesh the salvation - of god.
42.3.7.1^he was saying therefore to the coming out crowds to be baptized by him, offspring of vipers, who forewarned you to flee from the coming wrath?
42.3.8.1^produce therefore fruits worthy - of repentance;
42.3.8.2^and not begin to say in yourselves, as father we have - abraham.
42.3.8.3^i say for to you, that is able - god from - stones these to raise up children - to abraham.
42.3.9.1^already now also the ax to the root of the trees is applied;
42.3.9.2^every therefore tree not producing fruit good is cut down and into the fire is thrown.
42.3.10.1^and were asking him the crowds, saying, what then shall we do?
42.3.11.1^answering now, he was saying to them, the one having two tunics, let him impart to the one none having;
42.3.11.2^and the one having food, likewise let him do.
42.3.12.1^came then also tax collectors to be baptized, and they said to him, teacher, what shall we do?
42.3.13.1^- and he said to them, nothing more beyond that having been appointed to you collect.
42.3.14.1^were asking then him also those being soldiers, saying, what shall do also we?
42.3.14.2^and he said to them, no one extort nor accuse falsely, and be content with the wages of you.
42.3.15.1^are expecting then the people and wondering all in the hearts of them concerning - john, whether ever he might be the christ.
42.3.16.1^answered saying to all - john, i indeed with water baptize you;
42.3.16.2^comes however the one mightier than i, of whom not i am worthy to untie the strap of the sandals of him;
42.3.16.3^he you will baptize with the spirit holy, and with fire,
42.3.17.1^of whom the winnowing fork is in the hand of him, to clear the threshing floor of him and to gather the wheat into the barn of him.
42.3.17.2^- but the chaff he will burn up with fire unquenchable.
42.3.18.1^many indeed therefore other things exhorting, he was preaching the good news to the people.
42.3.19.1^- and herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him concerning herodias, the wife of the brother of him, and concerning all that had done the evils - herod,
42.3.20.1^added yet this to all:
42.3.20.2^also he locked up - john in prison.
42.3.21.1^it came to pass now in - having been baptized all the people, and jesus having been baptized, and having prayed, was opened the heaven,
42.3.22.1^and descended the spirit - holy in a bodily form as a dove upon him, and a voice out of heaven came:
42.3.22.2^you are the son of me, the beloved;
42.3.22.3^in you i am well pleased.
42.3.23.1^and himself was jesus beginning about years old thirty, being son, as was supposed, of joseph, - of heli,

42.3.28.1^- of melchi, - of addi, - of cosam, - of elmadam, - of er,
42.3.29.1^- of joshua, - of eliezer, - of jorim, - of matthat, - of levi,
42.3.30.1^- of simeon, - of judah, - of joseph, - of jonam, - of eliakim,
42.3.31.1^- of melea, - of menna, - of mattatha, - of nathan, - of david,

42.3.38.1^- of enosh, - of seth, - of adam, - of god.
42.4.1.1^jesus then, full of the spirit holy, returned from the jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness,
42.4.2.1^days forty being tempted by the devil.
42.4.2.2^and not he ate nothing in the days those, and having ended they, he was hungry.
42.4.3.1^said then to him the devil, if the son you are - of god, speak to the stone this, that it should become bread.
42.4.4.1^and answered to him - jesus, it has been written -:
42.4.4.2^not on bread alone shall live the man.
42.4.5.1^and having led up him, he showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
42.4.6.1^and said to him the devil, to you will i give the authority this all, and the glory of it;
42.4.6.2^for to me it has been delivered, and to whom if i wish, i give it.
42.4.7.1^you therefore, if you will worship before me, will be yours all.
42.4.8.1^and answering, - jesus said to him, it has been written:
42.4.8.2^the lord - god of you, you shall worship and him only you shall serve.
42.4.9.1^he led also him to jerusalem and set upon the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, if the son you are - of god, cast yourself from here down.
42.4.10.1^it has been written for -:
42.4.10.2^to the angels of him he will give orders concerning you, - to guard you;
42.4.11.1^and - in their hands will they bear you, lest ever you strike against a stone the foot of you.
42.4.12.1^and answering, said to him - jesus -, it has been said, not you shall test the lord the god of you.
42.4.13.1^and having finished every temptation, the devil departed from him until an opportune time.
42.4.14.1^and returned - jesus in the power of the spirit to - galilee;
42.4.14.2^and a report went out into all the surrounding region concerning him.
42.4.15.1^and he was teaching in the synagogues of them, being glorified by all.
42.4.16.1^and he came to nazareth, where he had been brought up;
42.4.16.2^and he entered according to the custom to him, on the day of the sabbaths, into the synagogue, and stood up to read.
42.4.17.1^and there was given to him the scroll of the prophet isaiah, and having unrolled the scroll, he found the place where it was written:
42.4.18.1^the spirit of the lord is upon me, of which because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor.
42.4.18.2^he has sent me to proclaim to the captives deliverance, and to the blind recovery of sight, to send forth the oppressed in deliverance,
42.4.19.1^to proclaim the year of the lord s favor.
42.4.20.1^and having rolled up the scroll, having delivered it to the attendant, he sat down, and of all the eyes in the synagogue were fixed upon him.
42.4.21.1^he began then to say to them -, today is fulfilled the scripture this, in the hearing of you.
42.4.22.1^and all were bearing witness to him and marveling at the words of the grace that are proceeding out of the mouth of him;
42.4.22.2^and they were saying, not the son is of joseph this?
42.4.23.1^and he said to them, surely you will say to me the proverb this, physician heal yourself!
42.4.23.2^whatsoever we have heard has been done in - capernaum, do also here in the hometown of you.
42.4.24.1^he said then, truly i say to you that no prophet acceptable is in the hometown of him.
42.4.25.1^in truth now i say to you, many widows there were in the days of elijah in - israel, when was shut up the heaven for years three and months six, when there was a famine great upon all the land;
42.4.26.1^and to none of them was sent elijah, if not to zarephath - of sidon, to a woman, a widow.
42.4.27.1^and many lepers were in - israel in the time of elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed, if not naaman the syrian.
42.4.28.1^and were filled all with anger in the synagogue, hearing these things;
42.4.29.1^and having risen up, they cast him out of the city and led him unto brow of the hill upon which the town had been built of them, in order to throw over him;
42.4.30.1^he however, having passed through the midst of them, went away.
42.4.31.1^and he went down to capernaum, a city - of galilee.
42.4.31.2^and he was teaching them on the sabbaths;
42.4.32.1^and they were astonished at the teaching of him, for with authority was the message of him.
42.4.33.1^and in the synagogue was a man having a spirit of a demon unclean;
42.4.33.2^and he cried out in a voice loud,
42.4.34.1^ha!
42.4.34.2^what to us and to you, jesus, of nazareth?
42.4.34.3^are you come to destroy us?
42.4.34.4^i know you who are, the holy one - of god.
42.4.35.1^and rebuked him - jesus, saying, be silent and come forth out of him!
42.4.35.2^and having thrown him the demon into the midst, it came out from him, in nothing having hurt him.
42.4.36.1^and came astonishment upon all, and they were speaking to one another, saying, what - word is this, that with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out?
42.4.37.1^and was spreading the report concerning him into every place of the surrounding region.
42.4.38.1^having risen up then out of the synagogue, he entered into the house of simon.
42.4.38.2^the mother-in-law then - of simon was oppressed with a fever great;
42.4.38.3^and they appealed to him for her.
42.4.39.1^and having stood over her, he rebuked the fever, and it left her;
42.4.39.2^immediately then having arisen, she began to serve them.
42.4.40.1^at the setting now of the sun, all as many as had any ailing with diseases various, brought them to him, - and on one each of them, the hands having laid, he would heal them.
42.4.41.1^were going out now also demons from many, crying out and saying -, you are the son - of god.
42.4.41.2^and rebuking them, not did he allow them to speak, because they knew the christ him to be.
42.4.42.1^having arrived now daybreak, having gone out, he went into a solitary place, and the crowds were seeking him, and they came up to him and were detaining him, of the not to go from them.
42.4.43.1^- but he said to them -, also to the other towns to preach the good news me it behooves, of the kingdom - of god;
42.4.43.2^because for this have i been sent forth.
42.4.44.1^and he was preaching in the synagogues - of judea.
42.5.1.1^it came to pass then in - the crowd pressing on him also to hear the word of god, and he was standing by the lake of gennesaret,
42.5.2.1^and he saw two boats lying by the lake;
42.5.2.2^- but the fishermen from them having gone out, were washing the nets.
42.5.3.1^having entered then into one of the boats, which was simon s, he asked him from the land to put off a little.
42.5.3.2^having sat down then, from the boat he was teaching the crowds.
42.5.4.1^when then he left off speaking, he said to - simon, put off into the deep and let down the nets of you for a catch.
42.5.5.1^and answering, simon said, master, through whole night having toiled, nothing have we taken;
42.5.5.2^at however the word of you, i will let down the nets.
42.5.6.1^and this having done, they enclosed a multitude of fishes great;
42.5.6.2^were breaking now the nets of them.
42.5.7.1^and they beckoned to the partners in the other boat, - having come, to help them, and they came and filled both the boats so that were sinking they.
42.5.8.1^having seen now, simon peter fell at the knees of jesus, saying, depart from me, for a man sinful am i, lord.
42.5.9.1^amazement for laid hold on him, and on all those with him, at the catch of the fish which they had taken,
42.5.10.1^likewise now also james and john, the sons of zebedee, who were partners - with simon.
42.5.10.2^and said to - simon, - jesus, not fear;
42.5.10.3^from - now on men you will be catching.
42.5.11.1^and having brought the boats to the land, having left all, they followed him.
42.5.12.1^and it came to pass in - being his in one of the cities, that behold, a man full of leprosy, having seen then - jesus, having fallen upon his face, begged him, saying, lord, if you would be willing, you are able me to cleanse.
42.5.13.1^and having stretched out the hand, he touched him, saying, i am willing;
42.5.13.2^be you cleansed!
42.5.13.3^and immediately the leprosy departed from him.
42.5.14.1^and he ordered him no one to tell:
42.5.14.2^but having gone, show yourself to the priest, and offer for the cleansing of you, as commanded moses, for a testimony to them.
42.5.15.1^was spread abroad now still more the report concerning him;
42.5.15.2^and were coming crowds great to hear and to be healed from the sicknesses of them.
42.5.16.1^he himself now was withdrawing into the wilderness and praying.
42.5.17.1^and it came to pass on one of the days that he was teaching, and there were sitting by pharisees and teachers of the law, who were come out of every village - of galilee, and of judea, and of jerusalem.
42.5.17.2^and the power of the lord was there for - to heal him.
42.5.18.1^and behold, men carrying upon a mat a man who was paralyzed, and they were seeking him to bring in and to place him before him.
42.5.19.1^and not having found what way they should bring in him on account of the crowd, having gone up on the housetop, through the tiles they let down him, with the mat into the midst before - jesus.
42.5.20.1^and having seen the faith of them, he said, man, have been forgiven you the sins of you.
42.5.21.1^and began to reason the scribes and the pharisees, saying, who is this who speaks blasphemies?
42.5.21.2^who is able sins to forgive, if not alone - god?
42.5.22.1^having known now - jesus the reasonings of them, answering, he said to them, why reason you in the hearts of you?
42.5.23.1^which is easier, to say, have been forgiven you the sins of you, or to say, arise and walk?
42.5.24.1^that however you may know that the son - of man authority has on the earth to forgive sins.
42.5.24.2^.
42.5.24.3^.
42.5.24.4^he said to the one having been paralyzed, to you i say, arise, and having taken up the mat of you, go to the house of you.
42.5.25.1^and immediately having stood up before them, having taken up that on which he was lying, he departed to the home of him, glorifying - god.
42.5.26.1^and amazement seized all, and they were glorifying - god, and were filled with fear, saying -, we have seen remarkable things today.
42.5.27.1^and after these things he went forth and he saw a tax collector named levi sitting at the tax booth;
42.5.27.2^and he said to him, follow me.
42.5.28.1^and having left all, having arisen, he began to follow him.
42.5.29.1^and made a banquet great levi for him in the house of him, and there was a multitude great of tax collectors and others, who were with them reclining.
42.5.30.1^and were grumbling the pharisees and the scribes of them at the disciples of him, saying, because of why with the tax collectors and sinners do you eat and drink?
42.5.31.1^and answering, - jesus said to them, no need have those being well of a physician, but those sick being.
42.5.32.1^not i have come to call righteous ones, but sinners, to repentance.
42.5.33.1^- and they said to him, the disciples of john fast often, and prayers make, likewise also those of the pharisees;
42.5.33.2^those however of you eat and drink.
42.5.34.1^- and jesus said to them, not are you able the sons of the bridechamber in which time the bridegroom with them is, to make to fast?
42.5.35.1^will come however days also when shall be taken away from them the bridegroom;
42.5.35.2^then they will fast in those - days.
42.5.36.1^he was speaking now also a parable to them -:
42.5.36.2^no one a piece of a garment new having torn, puts it on a garment old;
42.5.36.3^if however - otherwise also the new he will tear, and the old not will match, which is the piece - of the new.
42.5.37.1^and no one puts wine new into wineskins old;
42.5.37.2^if now - otherwise, will burst the wine - new the wineskins, and it will be spilled out, and the wineskins will be destroyed.
42.5.38.1^but wine new into wineskins fresh must be put.
42.5.39.1^and no one having drunk old wine desires new;
42.5.39.2^he says for, the old better is.
42.6.1.1^it came to pass then on a sabbath is passing along he through grainfields, and were plucking the disciples of him, and were eating the heads of grain, rubbing them in the hands.
42.6.2.1^some however of the pharisees said, why do you that which not it is lawful on the sabbaths?
42.6.3.1^and answering to them, said - jesus, not even this have you read, that which did david, when was hungry he himself, and those who with him were:
42.6.4.1^how he entered into the house - of god, and the loaves of the presentation having taken, ate, and gave to those with him, which not it is lawful to eat, if not only to the priests?
42.6.5.1^and he was saying to them, lord is of the sabbath the son - of man.
42.6.6.1^it came to pass then on another sabbath, entered he into the synagogue and taught;
42.6.6.2^and there was a man there, and the hand of him the right was withered.
42.6.7.1^were closely watching now him the scribes and the pharisees, whether on the sabbath he will heal, that they might find reason to accuse him.
42.6.8.1^he now knew the thoughts of them;
42.6.8.2^he said now to the man the withered having the hand, arise and stand in the midst.
42.6.8.3^and having risen up, he stood.
42.6.9.1^said then - jesus to them, i ask you, whether it is lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do evil?
42.6.9.2^life to save or to destroy?
42.6.10.1^and having looked around all on them, he said to him, stretch out the hand of you.
42.6.10.2^- and he did, and was restored the hand of him.
42.6.11.1^they themselves then were filled with rage, and were discussing with one another what - they might do - to jesus.
42.6.12.1^it came to pass then in the days those, went out he to the mountain to pray, and he was spending the night in - prayer - to god.
42.6.13.1^and when it became day, he called to him the disciples of him, also having chosen out from them twelve, whom also apostles he named:
42.6.14.1^simon whom also he named peter, and andrew the brother of him;
42.6.14.2^and james and john;
42.6.14.3^and philip and bartholomew;
42.6.15.1^and matthew and thomas;
42.6.15.2^and james son of alphaeus;
42.6.15.3^and simon the one called zealot;
42.6.16.1^and judas son of james;
42.6.16.2^and judas iscariot, who became the betrayer.
42.6.17.1^and having descended with them, he stood on a place level, and a crowd large of disciples of him, and a multitude great of the people from all - judea, and jerusalem, and the sea coast of tyre, and sidon,
42.6.18.1^who came to hear him and to be healed of the diseases of them.
42.6.18.2^and those troubled with spirits unclean were healed.
42.6.19.1^and all the multitude were seeking to touch him, because power from him was going out and healing all.
42.6.20.1^and he, having lifted up the gaze of him upon the disciples of him, was saying:
42.6.20.2^blessed are the poor, for yours is the kingdom - of god.
42.6.21.1^blessed are those hungering now, for you will be filled.
42.6.21.2^blessed are those weeping now, for you will laugh.
42.6.22.1^blessed are you when shall hate you - men, and when they shall exclude you, and shall insult you, and shall cast out the name of you as evil, on account of the son - of man.
42.6.23.1^rejoice in that - day, and leap for joy;
42.6.23.2^behold for, the reward of you is great in - heaven.
42.6.23.3^according to these things of them for used to treat the prophets the fathers likewise.
42.6.24.1^but woe to you who are rich, for you are receiving the comfort of you.
42.6.25.1^woe to you who having been filled now, for you will hunger.
42.6.25.2^woe to those laughing now, for you will mourn and will weep.
42.6.26.1^woe to you when of you well speak all - men, according to these things of them for used to treat the false prophets the fathers likewise.
42.6.27.1^but to you i say, to those hearing:
42.6.27.2^love the enemies of you, good do to those hating you,
42.6.28.1^bless those cursing you, pray for those mistreating you.
42.6.29.1^to the one striking you on the cheek, offer also the other;
42.6.29.2^and from the one taking away your - cloak, also the tunic not do withhold.
42.6.30.1^to everyone asking you, give, and from the one taking away what is yours, not ask it back.
42.6.31.1^and as you desire that should do to you - men, do to them likewise.
42.6.32.1^and if you love those loving you, what to you credit is it?
42.6.32.2^even for - sinners those loving them, love.
42.6.33.1^and for if you do good to those doing good to you, what to you credit is it?
42.6.33.2^for even - sinners the same do.
42.6.34.1^and if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive back, what to you credit is it?
42.6.34.2^even sinners to sinners lend, that they might receive the same amount.
42.6.35.1^but love the enemies of you, and do good, and lend, nothing expecting in return, and will be the reward of you great, and you will be sons of the most high;
42.6.35.2^for he kind is to the ungrateful and evil.
42.6.36.1^be you merciful, as also the father of you merciful is.
42.6.37.1^and not judge, that no not you should be judged;
42.6.37.2^and not condemn, that no not you should be condemned.
42.6.37.3^forgive, and you will be forgiven.
42.6.38.1^give, and it will be given to you.
42.6.38.2^measure good, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will they put into the lap of you, with that for measure you measure, it will be measured again to you.
42.6.39.1^he spoke then also a parable to them, not is able a blind man, a blind man to lead?
42.6.39.2^not both into a pit will fall?
42.6.40.1^not is a disciple above the teacher;
42.6.40.2^fully trained however, everyone will be like the teacher of him.
42.6.41.1^why now look you at the splinter that is in the eye of the brother of you, - and the beam that is in the own eye not notice?
42.6.42.1^how are you able to say to brother of you, brother, let that i might cast out the splinter that is in the eye of you, yourself the in the eye of you beam not seeing?
42.6.42.2^hypocrite, cast out first the beam from the eye of you, and then you will see clearly the splinter - in the eye of the brother of you to cast out.
42.6.43.1^no for there is tree good, producing fruit bad;
42.6.43.2^nor again a tree bad, producing fruit good.
42.6.44.1^each for tree by the own fruit is known.
42.6.44.2^not for from thorns do they gather figs, nor from a bramble bush grapes gather they.
42.6.45.1^the good man, out of the good treasure of the his heart brings forth that which is good;
42.6.45.2^and the evil, out of the evil, brings forth that which is evil.
42.6.45.3^out of for the abundance of his heart, speaks the mouth of him.
42.6.46.1^why now me do you call lord, lord, and not do what i say?
42.6.47.1^everyone who is coming to me, and hearing of me the words, and doing them, i will show you whom he is like.
42.6.48.1^like he is to a man building a house, who dug and deepened, and laid a foundation on the rock;
42.6.48.2^a flood then having come, burst upon the stream the house that, and not was able to shake it, because - well had been built it.
42.6.49.1^the one however having heard, and not having done, like is to a man having built a house on the ground without a foundation, on which burst the stream, and immediately it fell, and was the ruin of the house that great.
42.7.1.1^and when he had completed all the words of him in the hearing of the people, he entered into capernaum.
42.7.2.1^of a centurion then a certain servant, sick being, was about to die, who was to him valued highly.
42.7.3.1^having heard then about - jesus, he sent to him elders of the jews, begging him that having come, he might save the servant of him.
42.7.4.1^- and having come to - jesus, they were begging him earnestly, saying that, worthy he is, to whom you will grant this;
42.7.5.1^he loves for the nation of us, and the synagogue he built for us.
42.7.6.1^- and jesus was going with them.
42.7.6.2^already then, he not far being distant from the house, sent friends the centurion, saying to him, lord, not trouble yourself, not for worthy i am that under the roof of me you should come;
42.7.7.1^therefore neither myself counted i worthy to you to come;
42.7.7.2^but say in a word, and shall be healed the servant of me.
42.7.8.1^also for i a man am under authority appointed, having under me soldiers;
42.7.8.2^and i say to this one, go, and he goes;
42.7.8.3^and to another, come, and he comes;
42.7.8.4^and to the servant of me, do this, and he does it.
42.7.9.1^having heard then these things, - jesus marveled at him;
42.7.9.2^and having turned to the following him crowd, he said, i say to you, not even in - israel such great faith did i find.
42.7.10.1^and having returned to the house, those having been sent found the servant in good health.
42.7.11.1^and it came to pass on the next day, he went into a town called nain, and were going with him the disciples of him, and a crowd great.
42.7.12.1^as then he drew near to the gate of the town, also behold, was being carried out one having died, only begotten son of the mother of him;
42.7.12.2^and she was a widow.
42.7.12.3^and a crowd of the town, considerable, was with her.
42.7.13.1^and having seen her, the lord was moved with compassion on her, and said to her, not weep.
42.7.14.1^and having come up, he touched the bier;
42.7.14.2^those then bearing it stopped.
42.7.14.3^and he said, young man, to you i say, arise!
42.7.15.1^and sat up the dead man, and began to speak, and he gave him to the mother of him.
42.7.16.1^seized then fear all, and they began glorifying - god, saying -, a prophet great has risen up among us!
42.7.16.2^and -, has visited - god the people of him!
42.7.17.1^and went out the report this in all - judea concerning him, and in all the surrounding region.
42.7.18.1^and brought word to john the disciples of him concerning all these things.
42.7.18.2^and having called near two certain - disciples of him, - john
42.7.19.1^sent them to the lord, saying, you are the coming one, or another are we to look for?
42.7.20.1^having come then to him, the men said, john the baptist has sent us to you, saying, you are the coming one, or another are we to look for?
42.7.21.1^at that very - hour, he healed many of diseases, and afflictions, and spirits evil, and to blind many he granted to see.
42.7.22.1^and answering, he said to them, having gone, relate to john what you have seen and heard:
42.7.22.2^blind receive sight, lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and deaf hear, dead are raised, poor are gospelized.
42.7.23.1^and blessed is who if not shall be offended in me.
42.7.24.1^having departed then the messengers of john, he began to speak to the crowds concerning john:
42.7.24.2^what have you gone out into the wilderness to see?
42.7.24.3^a reed by the wind shaken?
42.7.25.1^but what have you gone out to see?
42.7.25.2^a man in fine clothing arrayed?
42.7.25.3^behold, those in clothing splendid and in luxury living, in the palaces are.
42.7.26.1^but what have you gone out to see?
42.7.26.2^a prophet?
42.7.26.3^yes, i say to you, and one more excellent than a prophet.
42.7.27.1^this is he concerning whom it has been written:
42.7.27.2^behold, i send the messenger of me before the face of you, who will prepare the way of you before you.
42.7.28.1^i say to you, a greater among those born of women than john no one is;
42.7.28.2^- yet the least in the kingdom of god, greater than he is.
42.7.29.1^and all the people having heard, even the tax collectors, declared as righteous - god, having been baptized with the baptism of john;
42.7.30.1^- but the pharisees and the lawyers, the counsel - of god rejected as to themselves, not having been baptized by him.
42.7.31.1^to what therefore will i liken the men of the generation this?
42.7.31.2^and to what are they like?
42.7.32.1^like are they to little children - in the marketplace sitting, and calling to each other one, saying:
42.7.32.2^we piped to you, and not you did dance;
42.7.32.3^we sang a dirge, and not you did weep.
42.7.33.1^has come for john the baptist, neither eating bread, nor drinking wine, and you say, a demon he has.
42.7.34.1^has come the son - of man, eating and drinking, and you say, behold, a man, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and of sinners.
42.7.35.1^and was justified - wisdom by all the children of her.
42.7.36.1^was asking now one him of the pharisees, that he should eat with him;
42.7.36.2^and having entered into the house of the pharisee, he reclined.
42.7.37.1^and behold, a woman who was in the city, a sinner.
42.7.37.2^and she having known that he had reclined in the house of the pharisee, having taken an alabaster flask of fragrant oil,
42.7.38.1^and having stood behind him at the feet of him weeping, the tears she began to wet with the feet of him, and with the hairs of the head of her, she was wiping them, and was kissing the feet of him, and was anointing them with the fragrant oil.
42.7.39.1^having seen now the pharisee, the one having invited him, he spoke within himself, saying, this, if he were a prophet, would have known - who and what the woman is who touches him, for a sinner she is.
42.7.40.1^and answering, - jesus said to him, simon, i have to you something to say.
42.7.40.2^- and, teacher, say it, he says.
42.7.41.1^two debtors there were to a creditor certain;
42.7.41.2^the one owed denarii five hundred;
42.7.41.3^- and the other, fifty.
42.7.42.1^nothing having they to pay, both he forgave.
42.7.42.2^which therefore of them, more will love him?
42.7.43.1^answering, simon said, i take it that he to whom the most he forgave.
42.7.43.2^- and he said to him, rightly you have judged.
42.7.44.1^and having turned to the woman, - to simon he was saying, see you this the woman?
42.7.44.2^i entered of you into the house, water of me for feet not you gave;
42.7.44.3^with her however - tears she wet my - feet, and with the hair of her wiped them.
42.7.45.1^a kiss to me not you gave;
42.7.45.2^she herself however, from which time i came in, not has ceased kissing my - feet.
42.7.46.1^with oil the head of me not you did anoint;
42.7.46.2^she herself however, with fragrant oil anointed the feet of me.
42.7.47.1^this therefore i say to you, have been forgiven the sins of her - many, for she loved much;
42.7.47.2^to whom however little is forgiven, little he loves.
42.7.48.1^he said then to her, have been forgiven your - sins.
42.7.49.1^and began those reclining to say within themselves, who this is who even sins forgives?
42.7.50.1^he said then to the woman, the faith of you has saved you;
42.7.50.2^go in peace.
42.8.1.1^and it came to pass afterward - soon, that he was traveling throughout city and village, preaching and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom - of god.
42.8.1.2^and the twelve were with him,
42.8.2.1^and women certain who had been cured from spirits evil and infirmities:
42.8.2.2^mary who is called magdalene, from whom demons seven had gone out;
42.8.3.1^and joanna wife of chuza, a steward of herod, and susanna, and others many, who were ministering to them out of the means their own.
42.8.4.1^as is assembling now a crowd great, and those from each town are coming to him, he spoke by a parable:
42.8.5.1^went out the one sowing - to sow the seed of him.
42.8.5.2^and in the sowing of him, some indeed fell along the road, and it was trampled upon, and the birds of the air devoured it.
42.8.6.1^and other fell upon the rock, and having sprung up it withered through - no having moisture.
42.8.7.1^and other fell in the midst of the thorns, and having sprung up with it, the thorns choked it.
42.8.8.1^and other fell upon the soil - good, and having sprung up, it produced fruit a hundredfold.
42.8.8.2^these things saying, he was calling out, the one having ears to hear, let him hear.
42.8.9.1^were asking then him the disciples of him, what this means, the parable?
42.8.10.1^- and he said, to you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom - of god;
42.8.10.2^to however the rest, it is in parables, so that, seeing, not may they see;
42.8.10.3^and hearing, not may they understand.
42.8.11.1^is now this the parable:
42.8.11.2^the seed is the word - of god.
42.8.12.1^those now along the road are those having heard;
42.8.12.2^then comes the devil and takes away the word from the heart of them, that not having believed they should be saved.
42.8.13.1^those now upon the rock, those who when they hear, with joy receive the word, and these a root not have, who for a time believe, and in time of testing fall away.
42.8.14.1^that now into the thorns having fallen, these are those having heard, and under cares, and riches, and pleasures - of life, moving along are choked, and not do mature.
42.8.15.1^that now in the good soil, these are those in a heart worthy and good, having heard the word keep it, and bring forth fruit by perseverance.
42.8.16.1^no one now a lamp having lighted, covers it with a vessel, or under a bed puts it, but on a lampstand puts it, so that those entering in may see the light.
42.8.17.1^nothing for is hidden which not manifest will become, nor secret which nothing not shall be known, and to light come.
42.8.18.1^take heed therefore how you hear;
42.8.18.2^whoever - for might have, will be given to him;
42.8.18.3^and whoever - not might have, even what he seems to have will be taken away from him.
42.8.19.1^came then to him the mother and the brothers of him, and not they were able to get to him, because of the crowd.
42.8.20.1^it was told also him, the mother of you and the brothers of you are standing outside, to see wanting you.
42.8.21.1^- but answering, he said to them, mother of me and brothers of me, those are who the word - of god are hearing and doing.
42.8.22.1^it came to pass then, on one of the days also he entered into a boat with the disciples of him, and he said to them, let us pass over to the other side of the lake.
42.8.22.2^and they launched out.
42.8.23.1^sailing then of them, he fell asleep.
42.8.23.2^and came down a storm of wind on the lake, and they were being swamped and were in danger.
42.8.24.1^having come to him then, they awoke him, saying, master, master, we are perishing!
42.8.24.2^- and having arisen, he rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and there was a calm.
42.8.25.1^he said then to them, where is the faith of you?
42.8.25.2^having been afraid then, they marveled, saying to one another, who then this is, that even the winds he commands and the water, and they obey him?
42.8.26.1^and they sailed down to the region of the gerasenes, which is opposite - galilee.
42.8.27.1^having gone forth then he upon the land, met him a man certain out of the city, having demons, and time a long not was wearing clothing, and in a house not did abide, but in the tombs.
42.8.28.1^having seen then - jesus, having cried out, he fell down before him, and in a voice loud said, what to me and to you, jesus, son - of god, the most high?
42.8.28.2^i implore of you not me you might torment!
42.8.29.1^he was commanding for the spirit - unclean to come out from the man.
42.8.29.2^many for times it had seized him, and he was bound, with chains and shackles being kept;
42.8.29.3^and breaking the chains, he was driven by the demon into the deserts.
42.8.30.1^asked now him - jesus, what your name is?
42.8.30.2^- and he said, legion, because were entered demons many into him.
42.8.31.1^and they were begging him, that not he would command them into the abyss to go away.
42.8.32.1^there was now there a herd of pigs many feeding, in the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow them into them to enter;
42.8.32.2^and he allowed them.
42.8.33.1^having gone out then the demons from the man, they entered into the pigs, and rushed the herd down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.
42.8.34.1^having seen then those feeding them that having taken place, they fled and reported it to the city and to the country.
42.8.35.1^they went out then to see that having taken place, and they came to - jesus and found sitting the man from whom the demons had gone out, clothed and being of sound mind, at the feet - of jesus.
42.8.35.2^and they were afraid.
42.8.36.1^related then to them those having seen it, how was healed the one having been possessed by demons.
42.8.37.1^and asked him all the multitude of the surrounding region of the gerasenes to depart from them, because with fear great they were seized.
42.8.37.2^he now, having entered into the boat, turned back.
42.8.38.1^was begging however him the man from whom had gone the demons to be taken with him.
42.8.38.2^he sent away however him saying,
42.8.39.1^return to the house of you, and relate all that for you has done - god.
42.8.39.2^and he departed, through all the city proclaiming all that had done for him - jesus.
42.8.40.1^when then - returned - jesus, received him the crowd;
42.8.40.2^they were for all looking for him.
42.8.41.1^and behold, came a man whose name was jairus, and he a ruler of the synagogue was, and having fallen at the feet - of jesus, he began begging him to come to the house of him,
42.8.42.1^because daughter an only was to him, about years old twelve, and she was dying.
42.8.42.2^as then - went he, the crowds were pressing around him.
42.8.43.1^and a woman being with a flux of blood for years twelve, who on physicians having spent all her living, neither was able by no one to be healed,
42.8.44.1^having come behind, touched the fringe the of cloak of him, and immediately stopped the flux of the blood of her.
42.8.45.1^and said - jesus, who is the one having touched me?
42.8.45.2^were denying it however all;
42.8.45.3^said - peter, master, the people surround you and press in.
42.8.46.1^- but jesus said, touched me someone;
42.8.46.2^i for know power has gone out from me.
42.8.47.1^having seen then the woman that not she was hid, trembling she came, and having fallen down before him, for what cause she touched him she declared before all the people, and how she was healed immediately.
42.8.48.1^- and he said to her, daughter, the faith of you has healed you;
42.8.48.2^go in peace.
42.8.49.1^still of him speaking, comes one from the synagogue ruler, saying -, has died the daughter of you;
42.8.49.2^no longer trouble the teacher.
42.8.50.1^- but jesus having heard, answered him, not fear;
42.8.50.2^only believe, and she will be saved.
42.8.51.1^having entered then into the house, not he did allow to go in anyone with him, if not peter, and john, and james, and the father of the child, and the mother.
42.8.52.1^they were weeping now all and mourning for her.
42.8.52.2^- but he said, not weep;
42.8.52.3^not for she is dead, but sleeps.
42.8.53.1^and they were laughing at him, knowing that she was dead.
42.8.54.1^he now, having taken hold of the hand of her, called out, saying -, child, arise!
42.8.55.1^and returned the spirit of her, and she arose immediately;
42.8.55.2^and he directed to her to be given to eat.
42.8.56.1^and were amazed the parents of her;
42.8.56.2^- and he instructed them no one to tell what had happened.
42.9.1.1^having called together then the twelve, he gave to them power and authority over all the demons, and diseases to heal,
42.9.2.1^and he sent them to proclaim the kingdom - of god and to heal the sick,
42.9.3.1^and he said to them, nothing take for the journey;
42.9.3.2^neither staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money, nor apiece two tunics to have.
42.9.4.1^and into whatever - house you might enter, there remain, and from there go forth.
42.9.5.1^and as many as - not might receive you, going forth from the city that, the dust from the feet of you shake off, as a testimony against them.
42.9.6.1^going forth then, they were passing through the villages, proclaiming the gospel and healing everywhere.
42.9.7.1^heard of now herod the tetrarch the things being done all, and was perplexed, because - it was said by some - john has been raised out from the dead,
42.9.8.1^by some also that elijah had appeared, by others also that a prophet one of the ancients had arisen.
42.9.9.1^said then herod, john i beheaded;
42.9.9.2^who however is this concerning whom i hear such things?
42.9.9.3^and he was seeking to see him.
42.9.10.1^and having returned, the apostles related to him whatever they had done.
42.9.10.2^and having taken them, he withdrew by himself into a town called bethsaida.
42.9.11.1^the now crowds having known it, followed him;
42.9.11.2^and having received them, he was speaking to them concerning the kingdom - of god, and those need having of healing, he was healing.
42.9.12.1^- and the day began to decline;
42.9.12.2^having come then the twelve said to him, dismiss the crowd, that having gone into the surrounding villages and countryside they might lodge, and might find provisions;
42.9.12.3^for here in a desolate place we are.
42.9.13.1^he said now to them, give to them you.
42.9.13.2^to eat - but they said, not there are to us more than loaves five, and fish two, if not having gone, we should buy for all the people this food.
42.9.14.1^they were for about men five thousand.
42.9.14.2^he said then to the disciples of him, make sit down them, groups of about in fifty.
42.9.15.1^and they did so and made sit down all.
42.9.16.1^having taken then the five loaves and the two fish, having looked up to the heaven, he blessed them and broke them, and he kept giving them to the disciples to set before the crowd.
42.9.17.1^and they ate and were satisfied all;
42.9.17.2^and was taken up that having been a surplus to them of fragments, hand-baskets twelve.
42.9.18.1^and it came to pass as - was he praying in solitary, were with him the disciples, and he questioned them, saying, whom me do pronounce the crowds to be?
42.9.19.1^- and answering, they said, john the baptist;
42.9.19.2^others also, elijah;
42.9.19.3^others now, that a prophet, one of the ancients, has arisen.
42.9.20.1^he said then to them, you however, whom me do pronounce to be?
42.9.20.2^peter then answering said, the christ - of god.
42.9.21.1^- and having strictly warned them, he instructed them to no one to tell this,
42.9.22.1^having said -, it is necessary for the son - of man many things to suffer, and to be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be killed, and on the third day to be raised.
42.9.23.1^he was saying then to all, if anyone desires after me to come, let him deny himself, and let him take up the cross of him every day, and let him follow me.
42.9.24.1^whoever for - might desire the life of him to save, will lose it;
42.9.24.2^whoever however - might lose the life of him on account of me, he will save it.
42.9.25.1^what for is profited a man, having gained the world whole, himself now having destroyed, or having suffered the loss of?
42.9.26.1^whoever for - may have been ashamed of me and - my words, him the son - of man will be ashamed of when he shall come in the glory of himself, and of the father, and of the holy angels.
42.9.27.1^i say now to you truthfully, there are some of those here standing, who no not shall taste of death until - they shall have seen the kingdom - of god.
42.9.28.1^it came to pass now after the sayings these, about days eight, and having taken peter and john and james, he went up on the mountain to pray.
42.9.29.1^and it came to pass in the praying of him, the appearance of the face of him was altered, and the clothing of him white became dazzling.
42.9.30.1^and behold, men two began talking with him, who were moses and elijah.
42.9.31.1^those having appeared in glory were speaking of the going out of him, which he was about to accomplish in jerusalem.
42.9.32.1^- and peter and those with him were heavy with sleep;
42.9.32.2^having awoken fully then they saw the glory of him, and the two men - standing with him.
42.9.33.1^and it came to pass in the departing of them from him, said - peter to - jesus, master, good it is for us here to be;
42.9.33.2^also let us make tabernacles three:
42.9.33.3^one for you, and one for moses, and one for elijah, not knowing what he is saying.
42.9.34.1^these things then as he is saying, came a cloud and was overshadowing them;
42.9.34.2^they feared then in the entering of them into the cloud.
42.9.35.1^and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, this is the son of me, - whom i have chosen;
42.9.35.2^him listen to!
42.9.36.1^and as - occurred the voice, was found jesus alone.
42.9.36.2^and they were silent, and to no one they told in those the days anything of what they had seen.
42.9.37.1^it came to pass then the next day, on having come down of them from the mountain, met him a crowd great.
42.9.38.1^and behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying, teacher, i implore you to look upon the son of me, for an only child to me he is.
42.9.39.1^and behold, a spirit takes him, and suddenly he cries out, and it throws into convulsions him with foaming, and with difficulty it departs from him, bruising him.
42.9.40.1^and i begged the disciples of you that they might cast out it, and not they were able.
42.9.41.1^answering now, - jesus said, o generation unbelieving and perverted, until when will i be with you and bear with you?
42.9.41.2^bring here the son of you.
42.9.42.1^while then he was coming near of him, threw down him the demon and threw him into convulsions.
42.9.42.2^rebuked then - jesus the spirit - unclean, and healed the boy, and gave back him to father of him.
42.9.43.1^were astonished then all at the majesty - of god.
42.9.43.2^of all however wondering at all which he did, he said to the disciples of him,
42.9.44.1^let sink you into the ears of you the words these;
42.9.44.2^- for the son - of man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.
42.9.45.1^- but they understand not the saying this, and it was veiled from them, that not they should understand it.
42.9.45.2^and they were afraid to ask him concerning the saying this.
42.9.46.1^came up then an argument among them, this, who - might be greatest of them.
42.9.47.1^- but jesus, having known the reasoning of the heart of them, having taken hold of a child, set it by him,
42.9.48.1^and he said to them, whoever if shall receive this - child in the name of me, me receives;
42.9.48.2^and whoever - me shall receive, receives the one having sent me.
42.9.48.3^the one for least among all you being, he shall be great.
42.9.49.1^answering now, john said, master, we saw someone in the name of you casting out demons, and we were forbidding him, because not he follows with us.
42.9.50.1^said then to him - jesus, not forbid;
42.9.50.2^whoever for not is against you, for you is.
42.9.51.1^it came to pass then in the completing the days of the ascension of him, that he the face steadfastly set - to go to jerusalem.
42.9.52.1^and he sent messengers before the face of him.
42.9.52.2^and having gone, they entered into a village of the samaritans, so as to make ready for him.
42.9.53.1^and not they did receive him, because the face of him was as going toward jerusalem.
42.9.54.1^having seen it now, the disciples james and john said, lord, will you that we should call fire to come down from - heaven and to consume them?
42.9.55.1^having turned then, he rebuked them.
42.9.56.1^and they went to another village.
42.9.57.1^and going of them along the road, said someone to him, i will follow you wherever if you may go.
42.9.58.1^and said to him - jesus, the foxes holes have, and the birds of the air nests;
42.9.58.2^- but the son - of man not has where the head he might lay.
42.9.59.1^he said then to another, follow me.
42.9.59.2^- but he said, lord allow me having gone away, first, to bury the father of me.
42.9.60.1^he said then to him, leave the dead to bury - their own dead;
42.9.60.2^you however, having gone forth, declare the kingdom - of god.
42.9.61.1^said then also another, i will follow you, lord;
42.9.61.2^first however allow me to bid farewell to those at the home of me.
42.9.62.1^said then to him - jesus, no one having laid the hand upon the plow, and looking on the things behind, fit is for the kingdom - of god.
42.10.1.1^after now these things, appointed the lord others seventy two and sent them in two by two before the face of himself into every city and place where was about he himself to go.
42.10.2.1^he was saying then to them, the indeed harvest is plentiful, - but the workmen are few.
42.10.2.2^pray earnestly to therefore the lord of the harvest, that workmen he may send out into the harvest of him.
42.10.3.1^go;
42.10.3.2^behold, i send forth you as lambs in the midst of wolves.
42.10.4.1^neither carry purse, nor bag, nor sandals;
42.10.4.2^and no one on the road greet.
42.10.5.1^into whatever now - you might enter house, first say peace to the house this.
42.10.6.1^and if there is a son of peace, will rest upon him the peace of you;
42.10.6.2^if however - not so, to you it will return.
42.10.7.1^in the same now - house remain, eating and drinking the things supplied by them;
42.10.7.2^worthy is for the workman of the wages of him.
42.10.7.3^not move from house to house.
42.10.8.1^and into whatever - city you might enter, and they receive you, eat the things set before you.
42.10.9.1^and heal - in it the sick, and say to them, has drawn near to you the kingdom - of god.
42.10.10.1^into whatever now - city you might enter, and not they receive you, having gone out into the streets of it, say,
42.10.11.1^even the dust - having clung to us out of the city of you to the feet, we wipe off against you;
42.10.11.2^yet this know, that has drawn near the kingdom - of god.
42.10.12.1^i say to you that for sodom in the day that, more tolerable it will be than the city for that.
42.10.13.1^woe to you, chorazin!
42.10.13.2^woe to you, bethsaida!
42.10.13.3^for if in tyre and sidon had taken place the miracles - having taken place in you, long ago - in sackcloth and ashes sitting, they would have repented.
42.10.14.1^but for tyre and sidon, more tolerable will it be in the judgment than for you.
42.10.15.1^and you, capernaum, not to heaven will you be lifted up;
42.10.15.2^to - hades you will be brought down.
42.10.16.1^the one hearing you, me hears;
42.10.16.2^and the one rejecting you, me rejects;
42.10.16.3^the one now me rejecting, rejects the one having sent me.
42.10.17.1^returned then the seventy two with joy, saying, lord, even the demons are subject to us through the name of you.
42.10.18.1^he said then to them, i beheld - satan as lightning out of the heaven having fallen.
42.10.19.1^behold, i give you the authority - to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and upon all the power of the enemy, and nothing you no not will injure.
42.10.20.1^yet in this not rejoice, that the spirits to you are subjected;
42.10.20.2^rejoice however that the names of you are written in the heavens.
42.10.21.1^in the same - hour, he rejoiced in the spirit - holy and said, i fully consent to you, father, lord of the heaven and of the earth, that you have hidden these things from wise and intelligent, and have revealed them to little children;
42.10.21.2^yes, - father, for thus well-pleasing was it before you.
42.10.22.1^all things to me have been delivered by the father of me.
42.10.22.2^and no one knows who is the son, if not the father;
42.10.22.3^and who is the father, if not the son, and to whom if might resolve the son to reveal him.
42.10.23.1^and having turned to the disciples in private, he said, blessed are the eyes - seeing what you see!
42.10.24.1^i say for to you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, and not saw;
42.10.24.2^and to hear what you hear, and not heard.
42.10.25.1^and behold, a lawyer certain stood up, testing him, saying, teacher, what having done, life eternal will i inherit?
42.10.26.1^- and he said to him, in the law what has been written?
42.10.26.2^how read you?
42.10.27.1^- and answering, he said, you shall love the lord the god of you with all the heart of you, and with all the soul of you, and with all the strength of you, and with all the mind of you  and the neighbor of you as yourself.
42.10.28.1^he said then to him, correctly you have answered.
42.10.28.2^this do, and you will live.
42.10.29.1^- but desiring to justify himself, he said to - jesus, and who is my neighbor?
42.10.30.1^having taken it up, - jesus said, a man certain was going down from jerusalem to jericho, and robbers fell among, who both having stripped him, and wounds having inflicted, went away, having left him half dead.
42.10.31.1^by chance now a priest certain was going down on the road that, and having seen him he passed by on the opposite side.
42.10.32.1^likewise now also a levite having come to the spot, having come and having seen him, passed by on the opposite side.
42.10.33.1^a samaritan however, one journeying, came to him, and having seen was moved with compassion,
42.10.34.1^and having approached, he bound up the wounds of him, pouring on oil and wine;
42.10.34.2^having put then him on the own beast, he brought him to an inn and took care of him.
42.10.35.1^and on the next day, having taken out he gave them two denarii, to the innkeeper and said, take care of him, and whatever more - you might expend, of me on - returning, i will repay you.
42.10.36.1^which of these - three a neighbor seems to you to have been of the one having fallen among the robbers?
42.10.37.1^- and he said, the one having shown - compassion toward him.
42.10.37.2^said then to him - jesus, go and you do likewise.
42.10.38.1^in now the proceeding of them, he entered into a village certain;
42.10.38.2^a woman now certain named martha received him.
42.10.39.1^and she had a sister called mary, who also having sat down at the feet of the lord, was listening to the word of him.
42.10.40.1^- but martha was distracted about much service;
42.10.40.2^having come up now, she said, lord, not is it concerning to you that the sister of me alone me has left to serve?
42.10.40.3^speak therefore to her that me she might help!
42.10.41.1^answering now, said to her the lord, martha, martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things;
42.10.42.1^one thing however is necessary, mary for the good portion has chosen, which not will be taken away from her.
42.11.1.1^and it came to pass in - being his in a place certain praying, when he ceased, said one of the disciples of him to him, lord, teach us to pray, as also john taught the disciples of him.
42.11.2.1^he said then to them, when you pray, say:
42.11.2.2^father, hallowed be the name of you.
42.11.2.3^come the kingdom of you.
42.11.3.1^the bread of us - daily give us - each day.
42.11.4.1^and forgive us the sins of us, also for ourselves we forgive everyone indebted to us;
42.11.4.2^and not lead us into temptation.
42.11.5.1^and he said to them, who among you will have a friend, and will go to him at midnight and say to him, friend, lend me three loaves,
42.11.6.1^since a friend of my is come off a journey to me, and nothing i have what i will set before him.
42.11.7.1^and he from within answering will say, not me trouble cause;
42.11.7.2^already the door has been shut, and the children of me with me in the bed are;
42.11.7.3^not i am able having risen up, to give to you.
42.11.8.1^i say to you, if even not he will give to him, having risen up, because of - being friend of him, because of yet the persistence of him, having risen he will give him as much as he needs.
42.11.9.1^and i to you say, ask and it will be given to you;
42.11.9.2^seek and you will find;
42.11.9.3^knock and it will be opened to you.
42.11.10.1^everyone for - asking receives;
42.11.10.2^and the one seeking finds;
42.11.10.3^and to the one knocking, it will be opened.
42.11.11.1^which now of you who is a father, will ask for the son a fish, and instead of a fish, a serpent to him will he give?
42.11.12.1^or also if he will ask for an egg, will he give to him a scorpion?
42.11.13.1^if therefore you, evil being, know gifts good to give to the children of you, how much more the father who is in heaven will give the spirit holy to those asking him!
42.11.14.1^and he was casting out a demon, and it was mute;
42.11.14.2^it came to pass then the demon having gone out, spoke the mute man.
42.11.14.3^and marveled the crowds.
42.11.15.1^some then of them said, by beelzebul the prince of the demons he casts out the demons.
42.11.16.1^others now, testing, a sign from heaven were seeking from him.
42.11.17.1^he now, knowing their - thoughts, said to them, every kingdom against itself having been divided is brought to desolation;
42.11.17.2^and a house against a house falls.
42.11.18.1^if now also - satan against himself is divided, how will stand the kingdom of him?
42.11.18.2^for you say, by beelzebul cast out i the demons.
42.11.19.1^if now i by beelzebul cast out the demons, the sons of you, by whom do they cast out?
42.11.19.2^on account of this, they of you judges will be.
42.11.20.1^if however by the finger of god i cast out the demons, then has come upon you the kingdom - of god.
42.11.21.1^when the strong man being armed might guard - his house, in peace are the possessions of him;
42.11.22.1^when however one stronger than he, having come upon him, shall overcome him, the complete armor of him he takes away in which he had trusted, and the plunder of him he divides.
42.11.23.1^the one not being with me against me is;
42.11.23.2^and the one not gathering with me scatters.
42.11.24.1^when the unclean spirit is gone out from the man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest;
42.11.24.2^and not finding any, then it says, i will return to the house of me, from where i came out.
42.11.25.1^and having come, it finds it swept and put in order.
42.11.26.1^then it goes and takes other spirits more evil than itself, seven, and having entered, they dwell there;
42.11.26.2^and becomes the last of the man that worse than the first.
42.11.27.1^it came to pass then, in - saying his these things, having lifted up one her voice, a woman from the crowd said to him, blessed is the womb - having borne you, and the breasts at which you nursed.
42.11.28.1^he then said, no rather, blessed are those hearing the word - of god and keeping it.
42.11.29.1^of the now crowds being pressed around together, he began to say, the generation this, generation an evil is;
42.11.29.2^a sign it seeks after, and a sign not will be given to it, if not the sign of jonah.
42.11.30.1^as for was jonah to the ninevites a sign, thus will be also the son - of man to the generation this.
42.11.31.1^the queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with the men of the generation this, and will condemn them.
42.11.31.2^for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon, and behold, greater than solomon here.
42.11.32.1^the men of nineveh will stand up in the judgment with the generation this, and will condemn it.
42.11.32.2^for they repented at the preaching of jonah, and behold, greater than jonah is here.
42.11.33.1^but no one a lamp having lit, in secret sets it, nor under the basket, but upon the lampstand, that those entering in the light may see.
42.11.34.1^the lamp of your body is the eye of you.
42.11.34.2^when the eye of you clear is, also all the body of you light is;
42.11.34.3^when however evil it be, also the body of you is dark.
42.11.35.1^take heed therefore, lest the light that is in you darkness be.
42.11.36.1^if therefore the body of you is full of light, not having part any dark, it will be light all, as when the lamp - shining might light you.
42.11.37.1^in then the speaking, asked him a pharisee that he would dine with him, having entered then, he reclined.
42.11.38.1^- and the pharisee, having seen it, marveled that not first he washed before the dinner.
42.11.39.1^said then the lord to him, now you - pharisees, the outside of the cup and of the dish you cleanse, - and the inside of you is full of plundering and wickedness.
42.11.40.1^fools!
42.11.40.2^did not the one having made the outside, also the inside make?
42.11.41.1^but of the things being within give alms, and behold, all things clean to you are.
42.11.42.1^but woe to you - pharisees, for you pay tithes of - mint and - rue and every herb;
42.11.42.2^and you pass by the justice and the love - of god.
42.11.42.3^these things also it behooved you to do, and those not to neglect.
42.11.43.1^woe to you - pharisees, for you love the first seat in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces.
42.11.44.1^woe to you, for you are like - graves - unmarked, and the men - walking above not have known it.
42.11.45.1^answering now, one of the lawyers says to him, teacher, these things saying, also us you insult.
42.11.46.1^- and he said, also to you the lawyers, woe!
42.11.46.2^for you burden the men with burdens heavy to bear, and yourselves with one of the fingers of you, not do touch the burdens.
42.11.47.1^woe to you, for you build the tombs of the prophets, - yet the fathers of you killed them.
42.11.48.1^so witnesses you are, and consent to the works of the fathers of you.
42.11.48.2^for they indeed killed them;
42.11.48.3^you now build their tombs.
42.11.49.1^because of this also the wisdom - of god said, i will send to them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and persecute,
42.11.50.1^so that might be charged the blood of all the prophets - having been poured out from the foundation of the world against the generation this,
42.11.51.1^from the blood of abel to the blood of zechariah, the one having perished between the altar and the house.
42.11.51.2^yes, i say to you, it will be required of the generation this.
42.11.52.1^woe to you, the lawyers, for you have taken away the key of the knowledge.
42.11.52.2^you yourselves not did enter, and those who are entering you hindered.
42.11.53.1^from there having gone forth of him, began the scribes and the pharisees urgently to press upon him and to make speak him about many things,
42.11.54.1^watching him to catch in something out of the mouth of him.
42.12.1.1^in these times, having been gathered together the myriads of the crowd so as to trample upon one another, he began to say to the disciples of him first, take heed to yourselves of the leaven, which is hypocrisy, of the pharisees.
42.12.2.1^nothing now concealed up is, which not will be revealed, nor hidden which not will be known.
42.12.3.1^instead, that whatever in the darkness you have said, in the light will be heard;
42.12.3.2^and what into the ear you have spoken in the inner rooms will be proclaimed upon the housetops.
42.12.4.1^i say now to you, those friends of me, not you should fear because of those killing the body and after these things not being able more abundantly anything to do.
42.12.5.1^i will show however you whom you should fear:
42.12.5.2^fear the one who after the killing, has authority to cast into - hell.
42.12.5.3^yes, i say to you, him fear.
42.12.6.1^not five sparrows are sold for assarion two?
42.12.6.2^and one of them not is forgotten before - god.
42.12.7.1^but even the hairs of the head of you all have been numbered.
42.12.7.2^not fear, than many sparrows you are more valuable.
42.12.8.1^i say now to you, everyone who - will confess in me before the men, also the son - of man will confess in him before the angels - of god;
42.12.9.1^the one now having denied me before - men, will be denied before the angels - of god.
42.12.10.1^and everyone who will speak a word against the son - of man, it will be forgiven him;
42.12.10.2^the one however against the holy spirit having blasphemed, not will be forgiven.
42.12.11.1^when then they bring you before the synagogues, and the rulers, and the authorities, not be anxious how or what you shall reply in defense, or what you should say;
42.12.12.1^the for holy spirit will teach you in same the hour what it behooves you to say.
42.12.13.1^said then one from the crowd to him, teacher, say to the brother of me to divide with me the inheritance.
42.12.14.1^- and he said to him, man, who me appointed a judge or partitioner over you?
42.12.15.1^he said then to them, beware and keep yourselves from all covetousness;
42.12.15.2^for not in the abundance to anyone, the life to him is of that which possesses of him.
42.12.16.1^he spoke then a parable to them, saying, of a man certain rich brought forth abundantly the ground.
42.12.17.1^and he was reasoning within himself, saying, what shall i do, for not i have where i will store up the fruits of me?
42.12.18.1^and he said, this will i do:
42.12.18.2^i will tear down my - barns and greater will build, and will store up there all the grain and the goods of me.
42.12.19.1^and i will say to the soul of me, soul, you have many good things laid up for years many;
42.12.19.2^take your rest;
42.12.19.3^eat, drink, be merry.
42.12.20.1^said then to him - god, fool!
42.12.20.2^this - night, the soul of you is required of you;
42.12.20.3^what now you did prepare   to whom will it be?
42.12.21.1^so is the one treasuring up for himself, and not toward god being rich.
42.12.22.1^he said then to the disciples of him, because of this i say to you, not be anxious for the life, what you should eat, nor for the body what you should put on.
42.12.23.1^the for life more than is the food, and the body than the clothing.
42.12.24.1^consider the ravens, that not they sow nor reap;
42.12.24.2^to them not there is a storehouse nor barn   and - god feeds them.
42.12.24.3^how much more you are valuable than the birds!
42.12.25.1^which now of you, being anxious, is able to the lifespan of him to add one hour?
42.12.26.1^if then not even the least you are able to do, why about the rest are you anxious?
42.12.27.1^consider the lilies, how they grow:
42.12.27.2^not do they labor, nor do they spin.
42.12.27.3^i say however to you, not even solomon in all the glory of him was arrayed as one of these.
42.12.28.1^if however in the field the grass, being here today and tomorrow into the furnace being thrown, - god thus clothes, how much more you, o you of little faith!
42.12.29.1^and you not seek what you might eat, and what you might drink, and not be in suspense;
42.12.30.1^these things for all the nations of the world seek after;
42.12.30.2^of you now the father knows that you have need of these.
42.12.31.1^but seek you the kingdom of him, and these things will be added to you.
42.12.32.1^not fear, - little flock, for took delight the father of you to give you the kingdom.
42.12.33.1^sell the possessions of you and give alms;
42.12.33.2^make to yourselves purses not growing old, a treasure unfailing in the heavens, where thief not does draw near, nor moth destroy.
42.12.34.1^where for is the treasure of you, there also the heart of you will be.
42.12.35.1^let be your - waist girded about, and the lamps burning;
42.12.36.1^and you, like to men waiting for the master of themselves, whenever he shall return from the wedding feasts, that having come and having knocked, immediately they might open to him.
42.12.37.1^blessed are the servants those, whom having come, the master will find watching.
42.12.37.2^truly i say to you that he will gird himself and will make recline them, and having come up, will serve them.
42.12.38.1^and if in the second and if in the third watch he comes and finds them thus, blessed are those!
42.12.39.1^this however know, that if had known the master of the house in what hour the thief is coming, not - he would have allowed to be broken into the house of him.
42.12.40.1^also you be ready;
42.12.40.2^for in the hour not you expect, the son - of man comes.
42.12.41.1^said then - peter, lord, to us the parable this speak you, or also to all?
42.12.42.1^and said the lord, who then is the faithful manager and the wise, whom will set the master over the care of servants of him, - to give them in season the measure of food?
42.12.43.1^blessed is the servant that whom having come, the master of him will find doing thus.
42.12.44.1^of a truth i say to you that over all the possessions of him he will set him.
42.12.45.1^if however should say the servant that in the heart of him, delays the master of me to come, and should begin to beat the men-servants and the maid-servants, to eat also and to drink and to get drunk,
42.12.46.1^will come the master of the servant that in a day in which not he does expect, and in an hour that not he knows, and he will cut in two him and the place of him with the unbelievers will appoint.
42.12.47.1^that now - servant, the one having known the will of the master of him and not having prepared, nor having done according to the will of him, will be beaten with many blows;
42.12.48.1^the one however not having known, having done however things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few.
42.12.48.2^everyone now to whom has been given much, much will be required from him;
42.12.48.3^and to whom has been committed much, the more will they ask of him.
42.12.49.1^fire i came to cast upon the earth, and how i wish if already it be kindled!
42.12.50.1^baptism however i have to be baptized with, and how i am distressed until while it should be accomplished!
42.12.51.1^think you that peace i came to give on the earth?
42.12.51.2^no, i say to you, but rather division.
42.12.52.1^there will be for from - now five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.
42.12.53.1^they will be divided father against son and son against father, mother against - daughter and daughter against - mother, mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law of her and daughter-in-law against - mother-in-law.
42.12.54.1^he was saying now also to the crowds, when you see a cloud rising up from the west, immediately you say -, a shower is coming, and it happens so.
42.12.55.1^and when a south wind is blowing, you say -, heat there will be, and it happens.
42.12.56.1^hypocrites!
42.12.56.2^the appearance of the earth and of the sky you know how to discern;
42.12.56.3^the time however this, how not do you know to discern?
42.12.57.1^why now even for yourselves not judge you what is right?
42.12.58.1^as for you are going with the adversary of you before a magistrate, in the way give earnestness to be set free from him, lest ever he should drag away you to the judge, and the judge you will deliver to the officer, and the officer you will cast into prison.
42.12.59.1^i say to you, no not shall you come out from there until even the last lepton you shall have paid.
42.13.1.1^were present now some at the same - time, telling him about the galileans of whom the blood pilate had mingled with the sacrifices of them.
42.13.2.1^and answering, he said to them, think you that - galileans these, sinners beyond all the galileans were, because such things they have suffered?
42.13.3.1^no, i say to you;
42.13.3.2^but if not you repent, all likewise you will perish.
42.13.4.1^or those - ten and eight on whom fell the tower in - siloam and killed them, think you that these debtors were beyond all the men - dwelling in jerusalem?
42.13.5.1^no, i say to you;
42.13.5.2^but if not you repent, all likewise you will perish.
42.13.6.1^he was speaking then this - parable:
42.13.6.2^a fig tree had a certain man planted in the vineyard of him;
42.13.6.3^and he came seeking fruit on it, and not did find any.
42.13.7.1^he said then to the vinedresser, behold, three years throughout these i come seeking fruit on the fig tree this, and not do find any.
42.13.7.2^cut down therefore it, that why even the ground should it use up?
42.13.8.1^- and answering, he says to him, sir, let alone it also this the year, until when i shall dig around it, and put in manure,
42.13.9.1^and if indeed it should bear fruit in the time, so be it.
42.13.9.2^if however - not, you will cut down it.
42.13.10.1^he was now teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbaths.
42.13.11.1^and behold, a woman a spirit having of infirmity, years ten and eight.
42.13.11.2^and she was bent over and not able to lift up herself to the full.
42.13.12.1^having seen then her, - jesus called her near and said to her, woman, you have been freed from the sickness of you.
42.13.13.1^and he laid upon her the hands, and immediately she was made straight and began to glorify - god.
42.13.14.1^answering now the ruler of the synagogue, indignant because on the sabbath had healed - jesus, he was saying to the crowd -, six days there are in which it behooves to work;
42.13.14.2^in these therefore coming be healed, and not on the day of the sabbath.
42.13.15.1^answered therefore him the lord and said, hypocrites!
42.13.15.2^each one of you on the sabbath, not does he untie the ox of him, or the donkey, from the stall, and having led it away, give it to drink?
42.13.16.1^this now, a daughter of abraham being, whom has bound - satan, behold, ten and eight years, not ought she to be loosed from the bond this on the day of the sabbath?
42.13.17.1^and these things on saying of him, were ashamed all those opposed to him;
42.13.17.2^and all the crowd was rejoicing at all the glorious things that were being done by him.
42.13.18.1^he was saying then, to what like is the kingdom - of god?
42.13.18.2^and to what shall i liken it?
42.13.19.1^like it is to a grain of mustard, which having taken, a man cast into garden his;
42.13.19.2^and it grew and came into a tree, and the birds of the air encamped in the branches of it.
42.13.20.1^and again he said, to what shall i liken the kingdom - of god?
42.13.21.1^like it is to leaven, which having taken, a woman hid in of meal measures three until it was leavened all.
42.13.22.1^and he was going through by towns and villages, teaching, and progress making toward jerusalem.
42.13.23.1^said then one to him, lord, if are few those being saved?
42.13.23.2^- and he said to them,
42.13.24.1^strive to enter in through the narrow door;
42.13.24.2^for many, i say to you, will seek to enter in, and not will be able.
42.13.25.1^from what - shall have risen up the master of the house, and shall have shut the door, then you should begin outside to stand and to knock at the door, saying, lord, open to us.
42.13.25.2^and he answering, will say to you, not i do know you, from where are.
42.13.26.1^then will you begin to say, we ate in presence of you and drank, and in the streets of us you taught.
42.13.27.1^and he will say, i tell you, not i do know you from where you are;
42.13.27.2^depart from me, all you workers of unrighteousness.
42.13.28.1^there will be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth when you see abraham, and isaac, and jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom - of god;
42.13.28.2^you however are being cast out.
42.13.29.1^and they will come from east and west, and from north and south, and will recline in the kingdom - of god.
42.13.30.1^and behold, there are last who will be first, and there are first who will be last.
42.13.31.1^in same the hour came near certain pharisees, saying to him, go out and proceed from here, for herod desires you to kill.
42.13.32.1^and he said to them, having gone, say to the fox that, behold, i cast out demons, and cures i complete today and tomorrow, and the third day i am perfected.
42.13.33.1^but it behooves me today and tomorrow and the day following to proceed;
42.13.33.2^for not it is possible for a prophet to perish outside of jerusalem.
42.13.34.1^jerusalem, jerusalem, - killing the prophets, and stoning those having been sent to her, how often i have wanted to gather those children of you, that way a hen gathers - her brood under the wings, and not you were willing.
42.13.35.1^behold, is left to you the house of you.
42.13.35.2^i say now to you, no not shall you see me until the time comes when you say, blessed is the one coming in the name of the lord.
42.14.1.1^and it came to pass on the going of him into a house of one of the rulers of the pharisees on a sabbath to eat bread, and they were watching him.
42.14.2.1^and behold, a man certain there was with dropsy before him.
42.14.3.1^and answering, - jesus spoke to the lawyers and to the pharisees, saying, is it lawful on the sabbath to heal or not?
42.14.4.1^- but they were silent.
42.14.4.2^and having taken hold of him, he healed him and let him go.
42.14.5.1^and to them he said, which of you a son or an ox into a pit will fall, also not immediately he will pull up him on day the sabbath?
42.14.6.1^and not they were able to reply to these things.
42.14.7.1^he was speaking then to those having been invited a parable, remarking how the first places they were choosing out, saying to them,
42.14.8.1^when you are invited by anyone to wedding feasts, not do recline in the first place, lest ever one more honorable than you might have been invited by him,
42.14.9.1^and having come, the one you and him having invited will say to you, give to this one your place, and then you should begin with shame the last place to take.
42.14.10.1^but when you are invited, having gone, recline in the last place, so that when might come the one having invited you, he will say to you, friend, come up higher.
42.14.10.2^then will be to you glory before all those reclining with you.
42.14.11.1^for everyone - exalting himself will be humbled, and the one humbling himself will be exalted.
42.14.12.1^he was saying then also to the one having invited him, when you make a dinner or a supper, not call - friends of you, nor the brothers of you, nor the relatives of you, nor neighbors rich, lest ever also they should invite in return you, and be made recompense to you.
42.14.13.1^but when a feast you make, call the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind;
42.14.14.1^and blessed you will be, because nothing they have to repay you.
42.14.14.2^it will be recompensed for to you in the resurrection of the righteous.
42.14.15.1^having heard then one of those reclining with him these things, he said to him, blessed is he who will eat bread in the kingdom - of god.
42.14.16.1^- but he said to him, a man certain was preparing a supper great, and invited many.
42.14.17.1^and he sent the servant of him at the hour of the supper to say to those having been invited, come, for now ready it is.
42.14.18.1^and began with one voice all to excuse themselves.
42.14.18.2^the first said to him, a field i have bought, and i have need going out to see it;
42.14.18.3^i beg of you, hold me excused.
42.14.19.1^and another said, yoke of oxen i have bought five, and i am going to prove them;
42.14.19.2^i beg of you hold me excused.
42.14.20.1^and another said, a wife i have married, and because of this not i am able to come.
42.14.21.1^and having come, the servant reported to the master of him these things.
42.14.21.2^then having become angry, the master of the house said to servant of him, go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and the poor and crippled and blind and lame bring in here.
42.14.22.1^and said the servant, sir, it has been done as you did command, and still room there is.
42.14.23.1^and said the master to the servant, go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in, so that may be filled of me the house.
42.14.24.1^i say for to you that not one the men of those - having been invited will taste of me the supper.
42.14.25.1^were going with then him crowds great;
42.14.25.2^and having turned, he said to them,
42.14.26.1^if anyone comes to me, and not hates the father of himself and the mother and the wife and the children and the brothers and the sisters, yes, and even the life of him, not he is able to be of me disciple.
42.14.27.1^whoever not carries the cross of himself and comes after me, not is able to be my disciple.
42.14.28.1^which for of you, desiring a tower to build, not first having sat down, counts the cost, whether he has for its completion?
42.14.29.1^thus not ever he having laid of it a foundation, and not being able to finish, all - seeing it may begin him to mock,
42.14.30.1^saying -, this - man began to build and not was able to finish.
42.14.31.1^or what king, proceeding with another king to engage in war, not, having sat down, first will take counsel whether able he is with ten thousand to meet the one with twenty thousand coming against him?
42.14.32.1^if now - not, still of him far off being, an embassy having sent, he asks - for peace.
42.14.33.1^so therefore every one of you who not does give up all that he himself possesses, not is able to be my disciple.
42.14.34.1^good is therefore the salt;
42.14.34.2^if however even the salt becomes tasteless, with what will it be seasoned?
42.14.35.1^neither for soil nor for manure fit is it;
42.14.35.2^out they cast it.
42.14.35.3^the one having ears to hear, let him hear.
42.15.1.1^were now to him drawing near all the tax collectors and the sinners to hear him.
42.15.2.1^and were grumbling the both pharisees and the scribes, saying -, this man sinners receives and eats with them.
42.15.3.1^he spoke then to them the parable this, saying,
42.15.4.1^what man of you, having a hundred sheep, and having lost of them one, not leaves the ninety nine in the open field, and goes after the one having been lost, until he finds it?
42.15.5.1^and having found it, he lays it on the shoulders of him, rejoicing.
42.15.6.1^and having come to the house, he calls together the friends and the neighbors, saying to them, rejoice with me, for i have found the sheep of me, the one having been lost!
42.15.7.1^i say to you that in the same way joy in - heaven there will be over one sinner repenting, rather than over ninety nine righteous ones, who no need have of repentance.
42.15.8.1^or what woman, drachmas having ten, if she should lose drachma one, not lights a lamp and sweeps the house, and seeks carefully until it she finds?
42.15.9.1^and having found it, she calls together the friends and neighbors, saying, rejoice with me, for i have found the drachma that i lost.
42.15.10.1^thus i say to you, there is joy before the angels - of god over one sinner repenting.
42.15.11.1^he said then, a man certain had two sons.
42.15.12.1^and said the younger of them to the father, father, give to me the falling to me portion of the property.
42.15.12.2^- and he divided between them the property.
42.15.13.1^and after not many days, having gathered together all, the younger son went away into a country distant, and there he wasted the estate of him, living prodigally.
42.15.14.1^having spent however of him all, there arose a famine severe throughout the country that, and he began to be in need.
42.15.15.1^and having gone, he joined himself to one of the citizens the country of that, and he sent him into the fields of him to feed pigs.
42.15.16.1^and he was longing to be filled from the pods that were eating the pigs;
42.15.16.2^and no one was giving to him.
42.15.17.1^to himself however having come, he was saying, how many hired servants of the father of me have abundance of bread, i however with hunger here am perishing?
42.15.18.1^having risen up, i will go to the father of me, and i will say to him, father, i have sinned against - heaven and before you;
42.15.19.1^no longer am i worthy to be called son of you.
42.15.19.2^make me like one of the servants of you.
42.15.20.1^and having risen up, he went to the father of himself.
42.15.20.2^still now he far being distant, saw him the father of him, and was moved with compassion, and having run, fell upon the neck of him and kissed him.
42.15.21.1^said then the son to him, father, i have sinned against - heaven and before you;
42.15.21.2^no longer am i worthy to be called son of you.
42.15.22.1^said then the father to the servants of him, quickly bring out robe the best and clothe him, and give a ring for the hand of him, and sandals for his feet;
42.15.23.1^and having brought the calf - fattened, kill it, and having eaten, let us be merry.
42.15.24.1^for this - son of mine dead was, and is alive again;
42.15.24.2^he was lost, and is found.
42.15.24.3^and they began to be merry.
42.15.25.1^was now the son of him, the elder, in the field;
42.15.25.2^and while coming up, he drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.
42.15.26.1^and having called near one of the servants, he began inquiring what - might be these things.
42.15.27.1^- and he said to him -, the brother of you is come, and has killed the father of you the calf - fattened, because in good health him he has received.
42.15.28.1^he was angry however, and not was willing to go in.
42.15.28.2^- and the father of him, having gone, was begging him.
42.15.29.1^- and answering, he said to the father of him, behold, so many years i serve you, and never a commandment of you i disobeyed, and to me never did you give a young goat, that with the friends of me i might make merry.
42.15.30.1^when however the son of you this, the one having devoured your - living with prostitutes, came, you have killed for him the fattened calf!
42.15.31.1^- and he said to him, son, you always with me are, and all that is mine, yours is.
42.15.32.1^to make merry however and to rejoice it was fitting, because the brother of you this, dead was, and is alive again;
42.15.32.2^and he was lost, and is found.
42.16.1.1^he was saying now also to the disciples, a man certain there was rich, who had a manager, and he was accused unto him as is wasting the possessions of him.
42.16.2.1^and having called him, he said to him, what is this i hear concerning you?
42.16.2.2^give the account of the stewardship of you;
42.16.2.3^not for you are able any longer to manage.
42.16.3.1^said then within himself the manager, what shall i do, for the master of me is taking away the management from me?
42.16.3.2^to dig not i am able;
42.16.3.3^to beg i am ashamed.
42.16.4.1^i know what i will do so that when i shall have been removed from the management, they might receive me into the homes of them.
42.16.5.1^and having called to him one each of the debtors of the master of him, he was saying to the first, how much owe you to master of me?
42.16.6.1^- and he said, a hundred baths of oil.
42.16.6.2^- and he said to him, take your the bill and, having sat down quickly, write fifty.
42.16.7.1^then to another he said, you now how much owe?
42.16.7.2^- and he said, a hundred cors of wheat.
42.16.7.3^he says to him, take your - bill and write eighty.
42.16.8.1^and praised the master the manager - unrighteous, because shrewdly he had acted.
42.16.8.2^for the sons of the age this more shrewd than the sons of the light in the generation - of themselves are.
42.16.9.1^and i to you say, for yourselves make friends by the wealth - of unrighteousness, that when it fails they might receive you into the eternal dwellings.
42.16.10.1^the one faithful with very little, also with much faithful is;
42.16.10.2^and the one with very little unrighteous, also with much unrighteous is.
42.16.11.1^if therefore in the unrighteous wealth, faithful not you have been, the true riches who to you will entrust?
42.16.12.1^and if in that which is of another, faithful not you have been, that which is yours who to you?
42.16.12.2^will give
42.16.13.1^no servant is able two masters to serve;
42.16.13.2^either for the one he will hate, and the other he will love;
42.16.13.3^or one he will be devoted to, and the other he will despise.
42.16.13.4^not you are able god to serve and money.
42.16.14.1^were listening to now these things all the pharisees, lovers of money being, and they were ridiculing him.
42.16.15.1^and he said to them, you are those justifying themselves before - men, - but god knows the hearts of you;
42.16.15.2^for that which among men is exalted is an abomination before - god.
42.16.16.1^the law and the prophets were until john;
42.16.16.2^from that time the kingdom - of god is proclaimed, and everyone into it forces his way.
42.16.17.1^easier for however it is the heaven and the earth to pass away, than of the law one stroke of a pen to fail.
42.16.18.1^everyone - putting away the wife of him and marrying another commits adultery.
42.16.18.2^and the one her put away from a husband marrying commits adultery.
42.16.19.1^a man now certain there was rich, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, making good cheer every day in splendor.
42.16.20.1^a poor man now certain named lazarus was laid at the gate of him, being full of sores
42.16.21.1^and desiring to be fed from that falling from the table of the rich man;
42.16.21.2^but even the dogs, coming, were licking the sores of him.
42.16.22.1^it came to pass that then died the poor man, and was carried away he by the angels into the bosom of abraham.
42.16.22.2^died then also the rich man and was buried.
42.16.23.1^and in - hades, having lifted up the eyes of him, being in torment, he sees abraham from afar, and lazarus in the bosom of him.
42.16.24.1^and he having cried out said, father abraham, have mercy on me and send lazarus, that he might dip the tip of the finger of him in water and cool the tongue of me;
42.16.24.2^for i am suffering in the flame this.
42.16.25.1^said then abraham, child, remember that you did fully receive the things good of you in the lifetime of you, and lazarus likewise the things evil.
42.16.25.2^now however here he is comforted;
42.16.25.3^you now are suffering.
42.16.26.1^and besides all these things, between us and you a chasm great has been fixed, so that those desiring to pass from here to you not are able, nor from there to us can they pass.
42.16.27.1^he said then, i implore you then, father, that you would send him to the house of the father of me
42.16.28.1^i have for five brothers   so that he might warn them, that not also they might come to the place this - of torment.
42.16.29.1^says however abraham, they have moses and the prophets;
42.16.29.2^let them hear them.
42.16.30.1^- and he said, no, father abraham, but if one from the dead should go to them, they will repent.
42.16.31.1^he said however to him, if moses and the prophets not they hear, not even if one out from the dead should rise, will they be persuaded.
42.17.1.1^he said then to the disciples of him, impossible it is for the stumbling blocks not to come, but woe to him by whom they come!
42.17.2.1^it is better for him if a stone of a mill is hung around the neck of him and he is thrown into the sea, than that he should cause to stumble - little of these one.
42.17.3.1^take heed to yourselves.
42.17.3.2^if should sin the brother of you, rebuke him;
42.17.3.3^and if he should repent, forgive him.
42.17.4.1^and if seven times in the day he should sin against you, and seven times should return to you, saying i repent, you shall forgive him.
42.17.5.1^and said the apostles to the lord, add to us faith!
42.17.6.1^said then the lord, if you have faith like a grain of mustard, you would have said - to the mulberry tree this, be uprooted and be planted in the sea, and it would have obeyed - you.
42.17.7.1^which now of you a servant having, plowing or shepherding, the one having come in out of the field, will say to him, immediately having come, recline?
42.17.8.1^but not will he say to him, prepare what i may eat, and having girded yourself about, serve me while i eat and drink;
42.17.8.2^and after these things shall eat and drink you?
42.17.9.1^not is he thankful to the servant because he did the things having been commanded?
42.17.10.1^thus also you, when you may have done all the things having been commanded you, say -, servants unworthy are we;
42.17.10.2^that which we were bound to do, we have done.
42.17.11.1^and it came to pass in the going up to jerusalem that he was passing through the midst of samaria and galilee.
42.17.12.1^and on entering of him into a certain village, met him ten leprous men, who stood afar off.
42.17.13.1^and they lifted up their voice, saying, jesus, master, have compassion on us.
42.17.14.1^and having seen them, he said to them, having gone, show yourselves to the priests.
42.17.14.2^and it came to pass in the going them, they were cleansed.
42.17.15.1^one then of them, having seen that he was healed, turned back, with a voice loud glorifying - god,
42.17.16.1^and he fell on his face at the feet of him, giving thanks to him;
42.17.16.2^and he was a samaritan.
42.17.17.1^having answered then, - jesus said, not the ten were cleansed?
42.17.17.2^- but the nine are where?
42.17.18.1^none was there found having returned to give glory - to god, if not the foreigner this?
42.17.19.1^and he said to him, having risen up go forth;
42.17.19.2^the faith of you has cured you!
42.17.20.1^having been asked now by the pharisees when is coming the kingdom - of god, he answered them and said, not comes the kingdom - of god with careful observation,
42.17.21.1^nor will they say, behold here, or there.
42.17.21.2^behold for, the kingdom - of god in the midst of you is.
42.17.22.1^he said then to the disciples, will come days when you will desire one of the days of the son - of man to see, and not you will see it.
42.17.23.1^and they will say to you, behold there, or behold here.
42.17.23.2^not go forth nor follow.
42.17.24.1^as for the lightning flashing from the one end of the sky to the other end of the sky shines, thus will be the son - of man in the day of him.
42.17.25.1^first however it behooves him many things to suffer, and to be rejected by the generation this.
42.17.26.1^and as it came to pass in the days of noah, thus will it be also in the days of the son of man:
42.17.27.1^they were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage, until that day entered noah into the ark, and came the flood and destroyed all.
42.17.28.1^likewise, as it came to pass in the days of lot, they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building;
42.17.29.1^in that then day went out lot from sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed all.
42.17.30.1^according - to these will it be in that day the son - of man is revealed.
42.17.31.1^in that - day, the one who will be on the housetop, and the goods of him in the house, not let him come down to take away them;
42.17.31.2^and the one in the field, likewise not let him return to the things behind.
42.17.32.1^remember the wife of lot!
42.17.33.1^whoever if may seek the life of him to save, will lose it;
42.17.33.2^whoever also - will lose it, will preserve it.
42.17.34.1^i say to you, in that - night there will be two upon bed one:
42.17.34.2^the one will be taken, and the other will be left.
42.17.35.1^there will be two women grinding at the same place:
42.17.35.2^the one will be taken, - and the other will be left.
42.17.37.1^and answering, they say to him, where, lord?
42.17.37.2^- and he said to them, where the body is, there also the vultures will be gathered together.
42.18.1.1^he was speaking then a parable to them about the way it behooves always to pray them and not to lose heart,
42.18.2.1^saying, a judge certain there was in a certain city, - god not fearing and man not respecting.
42.18.3.1^a widow then there was in the city that, and she was coming to him, saying, avenge me of the adversary of me.
42.18.4.1^and not he would for a time;
42.18.4.2^afterward however he said within himself, if even - god not i fear, nor man respect,
42.18.5.1^because yet - causes me trouble the widow this, i will avenge her, so that not to end coming, she exhaust me.
42.18.6.1^said then the lord, hear what the judge - unrighteous says.
42.18.7.1^- and god no not shall execute the avenging of the elect of him, the ones crying out to him day and night, and be deferring in regard to them?
42.18.8.1^i say to you that he will execute the avenging of them in quickness.
42.18.8.2^nevertheless, the son - of man having come, indeed will he find - faith on the earth?
42.18.9.1^he spoke now also to some - trusting in themselves that they are righteous, and despising the others, the parable this:
42.18.10.1^men two went up into the temple to pray, the one a pharisee, and the other a tax collector.
42.18.11.1^the pharisee, having stood, toward himself thus was praying, - god, i thank you that not i am like the rest of the men   swindlers, unrighteous, adulterers   or even like this - tax collector.
42.18.12.1^i fast twice in the week;
42.18.12.2^i tithe all things, as many as i gain.
42.18.13.1^- but the tax collector, afar off standing, not was willing not even the eyes to lift up to - heaven, but was striking the breast of himself, saying -, god, be merciful to me, the sinner!
42.18.14.1^i say to you, went down this one justified to the house of him, rather than that.
42.18.14.2^for everyone - exalting himself will be humbled;
42.18.14.3^the one however humbling himself will be exalted.
42.18.15.1^they were bringing then to him also the infants, that them he might touch;
42.18.15.2^having seen however, the disciples were rebuking them.
42.18.16.1^- but jesus, having called to him them, said, permit the little children to come to me, and not do forbid them;
42.18.16.2^of the for such is the kingdom - of god.
42.18.17.1^truly i say to you, whoever - not shall receive the kingdom - of god as a child, no not shall enter into it.
42.18.18.1^and asked a certain him ruler, saying, teacher good, what having done, life eternal will i inherit?
42.18.19.1^said then to him - jesus, why me call you good?
42.18.19.2^no one is good, if not alone - god.
42.18.20.1^the commandments you know:
42.18.20.2^not shall you commit adultery, not shall you murder, not shall you steal, not shall you bear false witness, you shall honor the father of you and the mother.
42.18.21.1^- and he said, these all have i kept from the youth
42.18.22.1^having heard then, - jesus said to him, yet one thing to you is lacking:
42.18.22.2^all, as much as you have, sell, and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens;
42.18.22.3^and come, follow me.
42.18.23.1^- and having heard these things, very sorrowful he became;
42.18.23.2^he was for rich extremely.
42.18.24.1^having seen then him, - jesus sorrowful became, saying, how difficultly those - riches having, into the kingdom - of god shall enter.
42.18.25.1^easier for it is a camel through an eye of a needle to go, than a rich man into the kingdom - of god to enter.
42.18.26.1^said then those having heard, then who is able to be saved?
42.18.27.1^- but he said, the things impossible with men, possible with - god are.
42.18.28.1^said then - peter, behold, we having left the own, followed you.
42.18.29.1^- and he said to them, truly i say to you that no one there is who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom - of god,
42.18.30.1^who no nothing shall receive manifold more in the time this   and in the age that is coming, life eternal.
42.18.31.1^having taken aside then the twelve, he said to them, behold, we go up to jerusalem, and will be accomplished all things - having been written by the prophets about the son - of man.
42.18.32.1^he will be betrayed for to the gentiles, and will be mocked, and will be insulted, and will be spit upon.
42.18.33.1^and having flogged him, they will kill him;
42.18.33.2^and on the day - third he will rise again.
42.18.34.1^and they none of these things understood;
42.18.34.2^and was the word this hidden from them, and neither they knew the things being spoken.
42.18.35.1^it came to pass then in the drawing near of him to jericho, a blind man certain was sitting beside the road, begging.
42.18.36.1^having heard now a crowd passing along, he was asking what might be this.
42.18.37.1^they told then him -, jesus of nazareth is passing by.
42.18.38.1^and he called out saying, jesus, son of david, have mercy on me.
42.18.39.1^and those going before were rebuking him, that he should be silent.
42.18.39.2^he however much more kept crying out, son of david, have mercy on me.
42.18.40.1^having stopped then, - jesus commanded him to be brought to him.
42.18.40.2^having drawn near then him, he asked him,
42.18.41.1^what to you desire you i shall do?
42.18.41.2^- and he said, lord, that i might receive sight.
42.18.42.1^and - jesus said to him, receive sight!
42.18.42.2^the faith of you has healed you.
42.18.43.1^and immediately he received sight and began following him, glorifying - god.
42.18.43.2^and all the people, having seen it, gave praise - to god.
42.19.1.1^and having entered, he was passing through - jericho.
42.19.2.1^and behold, a man by name called zacchaeus, and he was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.
42.19.3.1^and he was seeking to see - jesus, who he is, and not he was able because of the crowd, because - in stature small he was.
42.19.4.1^and having run to the front he went up into a sycamore-fig tree, so that he might see him, for that way he was about to pass.
42.19.5.1^and as he came to the place, having looked up, - jesus said to him, zacchaeus, having hurried come down;
42.19.5.2^today for in the house of you it behooves me to stay.
42.19.6.1^and having hurried, he came down and received him, rejoicing.
42.19.7.1^and having seen it, all were grumbling, saying -, with a sinful man he has entered to stay.
42.19.8.1^having stood then, zacchaeus said to the lord, behold, the half of me of the possessions, lord, to the poor i give;
42.19.8.2^and if of anyone anything i have defrauded, i restore it fourfold.
42.19.9.1^said then to him - jesus -, today salvation to the house this has come, because also he a son of abraham is.
42.19.10.1^came for the son - of man to seek and to save that having been lost.
42.19.11.1^were hearing while they these things, having proceeded, he spoke a parable, because - near being jerusalem of his, and thinking their that immediately is about the kingdom - of god to appear.
42.19.12.1^he said therefore, a man certain of noble birth proceeded to a country distant, to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.
42.19.13.1^having called then ten servants of himself, he gave to them ten minas and said to them, do business until that i come back.
42.19.14.1^- but the citizens of him hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, not we are willing for this man to reign over us.
42.19.15.1^and it came to pass on the returning of him, having received the kingdom, that he directed to be called to him the servants these to whom he had given the money, in order that he might know what they had gained by trading.
42.19.16.1^came up then the first, saying, lord, the mina of you, ten has produced more minas.
42.19.17.1^and he said to him, well done, good servant!
42.19.17.2^because in very little, faithful you were, to be having authority you are over ten cities.
42.19.18.1^and came the second, saying, the mina of you, lord, has made five minas.
42.19.19.1^he said then also to this one, and you over are to be five cities.
42.19.20.1^and - another came, saying, lord, behold the mina of you, which i kept lying away in a piece of cloth.
42.19.21.1^i was afraid for of you, because a man harsh you are.
42.19.21.2^you take up what not you did lay down, and you reap what not you did sow.
42.19.22.1^he says to him, out of the mouth of you i will judge you, evil servant.
42.19.22.2^you knew that i a man harsh am, taking up what not i did lay down and reaping what not i did sow?
42.19.23.1^then because of why not did you give of me the money to the bank, and i having come, with interest - it might have collected?
42.19.24.1^and to those standing by he said, take from him the mina, and give it to the one the ten minas having.
42.19.25.1^and they said to him, master, he has ten minas.
42.19.26.1^i say to you that to everyone - having will be given;
42.19.26.2^from however the one not having, even that which he has will be taken away.
42.19.27.1^furthermore, the enemies of mine these, those not having been willing for me to reign over them, bring here and slay them before me.
42.19.28.1^and having said these things he went on ahead, going up to jerusalem.
42.19.29.1^and it came to pass as he drew near to bethphage and bethany, toward the mount - called olivet, he sent two of the disciples,
42.19.30.1^saying, go into the ahead village, in which entering you will find a colt having been tied, on which no one ever yet of men has sat;
42.19.30.2^and having untied it, bring it.
42.19.31.1^and if anyone you asks, because of why do you untie it?
42.19.31.2^thus will you say, because the lord of it need has.
42.19.32.1^having departed then, those having been sent found it as he had said to them.
42.19.33.1^on untying then of them the colt, said the masters of it to them, why untie you the colt?
42.19.34.1^- and they said -, the lord of it need has.
42.19.35.1^and they led it to - jesus, and having cast their - garments on the colt, they put on it - jesus.
42.19.36.1^going then of him, they were spreading the garments of them on the road.
42.19.37.1^drawing near then of him already at the descent of the mount - of olives, began all the multitude of the disciples, rejoicing, to praise - god in a voice loud for all which they had seen the mighty works,
42.19.38.1^saying:
42.19.38.2^blessed is the coming - king in the name of the lord.
42.19.38.3^in heaven peace, and glory in the highest.
42.19.39.1^and some of the pharisees from the crowd said to him, teacher, rebuke the disciples of you.
42.19.40.1^and answering, he said, i say to you if these will be silent, the stones will cry out.
42.19.41.1^and as he drew near, having seen the city, he wept over it,
42.19.42.1^saying -, if you had known in the day this, even you, the things for peace!
42.19.42.2^now however they are hidden from eyes of you.
42.19.43.1^for will come days upon you that will cast around the enemies of you a barricade you;
42.19.43.2^and they will surround you and will hem in you on every side,
42.19.44.1^and will level to the ground you and the children of you within you, and not will leave a stone upon a stone within you, in place of which not you knew the season the of visitation of you.
42.19.45.1^and having entered into the temple, he began to cast out those selling,
42.19.46.1^saying to them, it has been written:
42.19.46.2^and will be the house of me a house of prayer.
42.19.46.3^you however it have made a den of robbers.
42.19.47.1^and he was teaching - every day in the temple;
42.19.47.2^the however chief priests and the scribes were seeking him to destroy, and the foremost of the people.
42.19.48.1^and not they found - what they might do;
42.19.48.2^the people for all were hanging on his words, listening.
42.20.1.1^and it came to pass on one of the days, as was teaching he the people in the temple and proclaiming the gospel, came up the chief priests and the scribes with the elders
42.20.2.1^and spoke, saying to him, tell us by what authority these things you do, or who is the one having given to you the authority this?
42.20.3.1^answering now, he said to them, will ask you i also one thing, and you tell me:
42.20.4.1^the baptism of john, from heaven was it, or from men?
42.20.5.1^- and they reasoned among themselves, saying -, if we should say from heaven, he will say, because of why not did you believe him?
42.20.6.1^if however we should say, from men, the people all will stone us;
42.20.6.2^having been persuaded for they are, john a prophet to be.
42.20.7.1^and they answered, not they knew from where.
42.20.8.1^and - jesus said to them, neither i tell you by what authority these things i am doing.
42.20.9.1^he began then to the people to speak the parable this:
42.20.9.2^a man certain planted a vineyard, and rented it to farmers, and went abroad a time long.
42.20.10.1^and in the season, he sent to the farmers a servant, that from the fruit of the vineyard they will give to him.
42.20.10.2^- but the farmers sent away him, having beaten him, empty-handed.
42.20.11.1^and he proceeded another to send a servant;
42.20.11.2^- but him having beaten and having dishonored, they sent away empty-handed.
42.20.12.1^and he proceeded a third to send;
42.20.12.2^- then also him having wounded, they cast out.
42.20.13.1^said then the master of the vineyard, what shall i do?
42.20.13.2^i will send the son of me, the beloved;
42.20.13.3^perhaps him they will respect.
42.20.14.1^having seen now him, the farmers began reasoning among themselves, saying, this is the heir;
42.20.14.2^let us kill him, so that ours might become the inheritance.
42.20.15.1^and having cast forth him outside the vineyard, they killed him.
42.20.15.2^what therefore will do to them the master of the vineyard?
42.20.16.1^he will come and will destroy the farmers these, and will give the vineyard to others.
42.20.16.2^having heard it, then they said, never may it be!
42.20.17.1^- but having looked at them, he said, what then is that has been written this:
42.20.17.2^the stone which rejected those building, this has become into the head of the corner
42.20.18.1^everyone - falling on that - stone will be broken;
42.20.18.2^on whomever but - it might fall, it will grind into powder him.
42.20.19.1^and sought the scribes and the chief priests to lay on him - hands in that - hour;
42.20.19.2^and they feared the people;
42.20.19.3^they perceived for that against them he was speaking the parable this.
42.20.20.1^and having watched him, they sent spies, feigning themselves righteous to be, that they might catch him in talk, in order to deliver him to the rule and to the authority of the governor.
42.20.21.1^and they questioned him, saying, teacher, we know that rightly you speak and teach, and not receive any person, but on the basis of truth the way - of god teach.
42.20.22.1^is it lawful for us to caesar tribute to give, or not?
42.20.23.1^having perceived however of them the craftiness, he said to them,
42.20.24.1^show me a denarius.
42.20.24.2^of whom has it the image and inscription?
42.20.24.3^- and they said, caesar s.
42.20.25.1^- and he said to them, therefore give back the things of caesar to caesar, and the things - of god - to god.
42.20.26.1^and not they were able to catch him in his word before the people;
42.20.26.2^and having marveled at the answer of him, they became silent.
42.20.27.1^having approached then some of the sadducees, the ones denying a resurrection not there is, they questioned him,
42.20.28.1^saying, teacher, moses wrote to us if anyone s brother should die having a wife, and he childless is, that should take the brother of him the wife and should raise up seed to the brother of him.
42.20.29.1^seven therefore brothers there were;
42.20.29.2^and the first, having taken a wife, died childless;
42.20.30.1^and the second,
42.20.31.1^and the third took her;
42.20.31.2^likewise then also the seven not did leave children, and died.
42.20.32.1^finally also the woman died.
42.20.33.1^the woman therefore, in the resurrection, of which of them does she become wife?
42.20.33.2^- for the seven had her as wife.
42.20.34.1^and said to them - jesus, the sons of the age this marry and are given in marriage;
42.20.35.1^those however having been considered worthy to the age that which is to obtain, and the resurrection which is out from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage;
42.20.36.1^neither for to die any more are they able, like the angels for they are;
42.20.36.2^and sons they are of god, of the resurrection sons being.
42.20.37.1^that however are raised the dead, even moses showed at the bush, when he calls the lord the god of abraham, and god of isaac, and god of jacob.
42.20.38.1^god now not he is of the dead, but of the living;
42.20.38.2^all for to him live.
42.20.39.1^answering now, some of the scribes said, teacher, well you have spoken.
42.20.40.1^no longer then did they dare to ask him anything.
42.20.41.1^he said then to them, how do they declare the christ to be of david son?
42.20.42.1^himself for david says in the book of psalms:
42.20.42.2^said the lord to the lord of me, sit at the right hand of me,
42.20.43.1^until - i place the enemies of you, as a footstool of the feet of you.
42.20.44.1^david therefore lord him calls, and how of him son is he?
42.20.45.1^were listening now all the people, he said to the disciples of him,
42.20.46.1^beware of the scribes, - desiring to walk in long robes, and loving greetings in the marketplaces, and first seats in the synagogues, and first places in the banquets;
42.20.47.1^who devour the houses of widows, and as a pretext at great length pray.
42.20.47.2^these will receive more abundant condemnation.
42.21.1.1^having looked up now, he saw the ones casting into the treasury the gifts of them rich.
42.21.2.1^he saw then a certain widow poor casting in lepta two.
42.21.3.1^and he said, truly i say to you that the widow this - poor, more than all has cast in;
42.21.4.1^all for these out of that which was abounding to them cast in the gifts;
42.21.4.2^she however, out of the poverty of her, all the livelihood that she had did cast.
42.21.5.1^and as some were speaking about the temple, that with stones goodly and consecrated gifts it was adorned, he said,
42.21.6.1^as to these things which you are beholding, will come the days in which not will be left stone upon stone which not will be thrown down.
42.21.7.1^they asked then him, saying, teacher, when then these things will be, and what will be the sign when are about these things to take place?
42.21.8.1^- and he said, take heed, lest you be led astray;
42.21.8.2^many for will come in the name of me, saying, i am he, and the time is drawn near.
42.21.8.3^not go after them.
42.21.9.1^when then you should hear of wars and commotions, not be terrified;
42.21.9.2^it behooves for these things to take place first, but not immediately is the end.
42.21.10.1^then he was saying to them, will rise up nation against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
42.21.11.1^earthquakes both great, and in different places famines and pestilences there will be;
42.21.11.2^fearful sights also and from heaven signs great will there be.
42.21.12.1^before however these things all, they will lay upon you the hands of them, and will persecute you, delivering you to the synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors on account of the name of me.
42.21.13.1^it will result to you for a testimony.
42.21.14.1^settle therefore in the minds of you not to premeditate to make a defense;
42.21.15.1^i for will give you a mouth and wisdom, which not will be able to resist nor to reply to all those opposing you.
42.21.16.1^you will be betrayed then even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and they will put to death some from among you.
42.21.17.1^and you will be hated by all because of the name of me.
42.21.18.1^but a hair of the head of you no not should perish.
42.21.19.1^by the patient endurance of you, you will gain the souls of you.
42.21.20.1^when then you see being encircled by encampments jerusalem, then know that has drawn near the desolation of her.
42.21.21.1^then those in - judea, let them flee to the mountains;
42.21.21.2^and those in midst of her, let them depart out;
42.21.21.3^and those in the countries, not let them enter into her;
42.21.22.1^for the days of avenging these are, - to fulfill all things - having been written.
42.21.23.1^but woe to those in womb having, and to the ones nursing in those the days;
42.21.23.2^there will be for distress great upon the land and wrath to the people this.
42.21.24.1^and they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into the nations;
42.21.24.2^all and jerusalem will be trodden down by the gentiles, until that are fulfilled the times of the gentiles.
42.21.25.1^and there will be signs in sun, and moon, and stars;
42.21.25.2^and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity, the roaring of the sea and rolling surge,
42.21.26.1^fainting men from fear and expectation of that which is coming on the earth;
42.21.26.2^- for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
42.21.27.1^and then will they see the son - of man coming in a cloud, with power and glory great.
42.21.28.1^beginning then of these things to come to pass, look up and lift up the heads of you, because draws near the redemption of you.
42.21.29.1^and he spoke a parable to them:
42.21.29.2^behold the fig tree and all the trees.
42.21.30.1^when they sprout already, looking on them for yourselves, you know that already near the summer is.
42.21.31.1^so also you, when you see these things coming to pass, know that near is the kingdom - of god.
42.21.32.1^truly i say to you, that no not will have passed away the generation this, until - all these things shall have taken place.
42.21.33.1^the heaven and the earth will pass away, - but the words of me no not will pass away.
42.21.34.1^take heed now to yourselves, lest ever be burdened of you the hearts with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of life   and would come upon you suddenly the day that
42.21.35.1^as a snare.
42.21.35.2^it will come for upon all those sitting upon the face of all the earth.
42.21.36.1^watch also at every season, praying that you may have strength to escape these things all that are about to come to pass and to stand before the son - of man.
42.21.37.1^he was now during the day in the temple teaching, - and the evening going out, he was lodging on the mount - called olivet.
42.21.38.1^and all the people would come early in the morning to him in the temple to hear him.
42.22.1.1^was drawing near now the feast of unleavened bread, - called passover.
42.22.2.1^and were seeking the chief priests and the scribes - how they might put to death him;
42.22.2.2^they were afraid for of the people.
42.22.3.1^entered then satan into judas, the one being called iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.
42.22.4.1^and having gone away, he spoke with the chief priests and captains, the how to them he might betray him.
42.22.5.1^and they rejoiced and agreed him money to give.
42.22.6.1^and he promised, and began seeking opportunity - to betray him apart from a crowd to them.
42.22.7.1^came then the day of unleavened bread on which it was necessary for to be sacrificed the passover lamb.
42.22.8.1^and he sent peter and john, having said, having gone, prepare for us the passover, that we might eat it.
42.22.9.1^- and they said to him, where will you we should prepare?
42.22.10.1^- and he said to them, behold, having entered of you into the city, will meet you a man, a pitcher of water carrying;
42.22.10.2^follow him into the house into which he enters;
42.22.11.1^and you shall say to the master of the house, says to you the teacher, where is the guest room, where the passover with the disciples of me i may eat?
42.22.12.1^and he you will show an upper room large, furnished;
42.22.12.2^there prepare.
42.22.13.1^having gone then, they found it as he had said to them;
42.22.13.2^and they prepared the passover.
42.22.14.1^and when was come the hour, he reclined, and the apostles with him.
42.22.15.1^and he said to them, with desire i have desired this - passover to eat with you before - i suffer.
42.22.16.1^i say for to you that never not will i eat thereof, until when it is fulfilled in the kingdom - of god.
42.22.17.1^and having received the cup, having given thanks, he said, take this, and divide it among yourselves.
42.22.18.1^i say for to you, that no not will i drink from - now of the fruit of the vine, until that the kingdom - of god shall come.
42.22.19.1^and having taken the bread, having given thanks, he broke it and gave to them, saying, this is the body of me, which for you is given;
42.22.19.2^this do in the of me remembrance,
42.22.20.1^and the cup likewise after which having supped, saying, this - cup is the new covenant in the blood of me, which for you is being poured out.
42.22.21.1^but, behold, the hand of him betraying me is with me on the table.
42.22.22.1^for the son indeed of man, according to that having been determined goes, but woe to the man that by whom he is betrayed.
42.22.23.1^and they began to question among themselves - who then it might be of them who this is about to do.
42.22.24.1^there was then also a dispute among them, - which of them is thought to be the greatest.
42.22.25.1^- and he said to them, the kings of the gentiles rule over them, and those exercising authority over them, benefactors are called.
42.22.26.1^you however not thus shall be.
42.22.26.2^instead, the greatest among you, let him be as the younger;
42.22.26.3^and the one leading, as the one serving.
42.22.27.1^who for is greater, the one reclining or the one serving?
42.22.27.2^is not the one reclining?
42.22.27.3^i however in the midst of you am, as the one serving.
42.22.28.1^you now are those having remained with me in the trials of me.
42.22.29.1^and i appoint to you, as appointed to me the father of me, a kingdom,
42.22.30.1^so that you may eat and may drink at the table of me in the kingdom of me, and may sit on thrones, the twelve tribes judging of israel.
42.22.31.1^simon, simon, behold, - satan demanded to have all of you - to sift like - wheat;
42.22.32.1^i however begged for you, that not may fail the faith of you;
42.22.32.2^and you, when you have turned back, strengthen the brothers of you.
42.22.33.1^- and he said to him, lord, with you ready i am both to prison and to death to go.
42.22.34.1^- and he said, i tell you peter, not will crow today the rooster, until three times me you will deny knowing.
42.22.35.1^and he said to them, when i sent you without purse and bag and sandals, not anything did you lack?
42.22.35.2^- and they said, nothing.
42.22.36.1^he said then to them, but now the one having a purse, let him take it;
42.22.36.2^likewise also a bag;
42.22.36.3^and the one not having, let him sell the cloak of him and buy one a sword.
42.22.37.1^i say for to you that this which has been written, it behooves to be accomplished in me:
42.22.37.2^- and with the lawless he was reckoned.
42.22.37.3^and for the things concerning me an end have.
42.22.38.1^- and they said, lord, behold, swords here are two.
42.22.38.2^- and he said to them, enough it is.
42.22.39.1^and having gone forth, he went according to the custom to the mount - of olives;
42.22.39.2^followed then him also the disciples.
42.22.40.1^having come then to the place, he said to them, pray not to enter into temptation.
42.22.41.1^and he withdrew from them about a stone s throw, and having fallen on the knees, he was praying,
42.22.42.1^saying, father, if you are willing, take away this - cup from me.
42.22.42.2^yet not the will of me, but - of you be done.
42.22.43.1^appeared then to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.
42.22.44.1^and having been in agony, more earnestly he was praying.
42.22.44.2^and became the sweat of him like great drops of blood, falling down upon the ground.
42.22.45.1^and having risen up from the prayer, having come to the disciples, he found sleeping them from the grief,
42.22.46.1^and he said to them, why are you sleeping?
42.22.46.2^having risen up pray, that not you might enter into temptation.
42.22.47.1^while still of him speaking, behold, a crowd, and he who is called judas, one of the twelve, was going before them, and he drew near - to jesus to kiss him.
42.22.48.1^jesus then said to him, judas, with a kiss the son - of man are you betraying?
42.22.49.1^having seen then those around him what would be, they said, lord, if will we strike with the sword?
42.22.50.1^and struck one a certain of them of the high priest the servant, and cut off the ear, his - right.
42.22.51.1^answering now, - jesus said, allow you as far as thus!
42.22.51.2^and having touched the ear, he healed him.
42.22.52.1^said then jesus to those having come out against him, chief priests, and captains of the temple, and elders, as against a robber have you come out with swords and clubs?
42.22.53.1^every day being of me with you in the temple, not did you stretch out the hands against me;
42.22.53.2^but this is of you the hour, and the power of the darkness.
42.22.54.1^having seized then him, they led him away, and led him into the house of the high priest.
42.22.54.2^- and peter was following afar off.
42.22.55.1^they having kindled then a fire in the midst of the courtyard, and having sat down together, was sitting - peter among them.
42.22.56.1^having seen then him a servant girl certain sitting by the light, and having looked intently on him, she said, also this one with him was.
42.22.57.1^- but he denied it, saying, not i do know him, woman.
42.22.58.1^and after a little, another having seen him, was saying, also you of them are.
42.22.58.2^- but peter was saying, man, not i am.
42.22.59.1^and having elapsed about hour one, other a certain strongly affirmed it, saying, of a truth, also this one with him was;
42.22.59.2^also for a galilean he is.
42.22.60.1^said however - peter, man, not i know what you say.
42.22.60.2^and immediately while he was speaking of him, crowed the rooster.
42.22.61.1^and having turned, the lord looked at - peter, and remembered - peter the word of the lord, how he had said to him -, before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.
42.22.62.1^and having gone forth outside, he wept bitterly.
42.22.63.1^and the men who are holding him began mocking him, beating him.
42.22.64.1^and having blindfolded him, they were questioning him, saying, prophesy, who is the one having struck you?
42.22.65.1^and other things many, blaspheming, they were saying to him.
42.22.66.1^and when it became day, were gathered together the elderhood of the people, chief priests both and scribes, and they led him into the council of them,
42.22.67.1^saying, if you are the christ, tell us.
42.22.67.2^he said then to them, if you i should tell, no not would you believe;
42.22.68.1^if then i should ask you, no not would you answer.
42.22.69.1^from - now on also will be the son - of man sitting at the right hand of the power - of god.
42.22.70.1^they said then all, you then are the son - of god?
42.22.70.2^- and to them he was saying, you say that i am.
42.22.71.1^- and they said, what any more have we of witness need?
42.22.71.2^we ourselves for have heard it from the mouth of him.
42.23.1.1^and having risen up, all the multitude of them led him to - pilate.
42.23.2.1^they began then to accuse him, saying, this man we found misleading the nation of us and forbidding tribute to caesar to be given, and declaring himself christ, a king, to be.
42.23.3.1^- and pilate questioned him, saying, you are the king of the jews?
42.23.3.2^- and answering him, he was saying, you say.
42.23.4.1^- and pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, not find i guilt in the man this.
42.23.5.1^- but they kept insisting, saying -, he stirs up the people, teaching throughout all - of judea, and he has begun from - galilee even to here.
42.23.6.1^pilate now having heard, asked whether the man a galilean is,
42.23.7.1^and having learned that from the jurisdiction of herod he is, he sent up him to herod, being also he himself in jerusalem in those - days.
42.23.8.1^- and herod, having seen - jesus, was glad exceedingly;
42.23.8.2^he was for of a long time wishing to see him, because of - hearing concerning him;
42.23.8.3^and he was hoping some sign to see by him done.
42.23.9.1^he kept questioning then him in words many;
42.23.9.2^he however nothing answered him.
42.23.10.1^had been standing by now the chief priests and the scribes, vehemently accusing him.
42.23.11.1^having set at naught then him, also - herod with the troops of him, and having mocked him, having put on him apparel splendid, sent back him to pilate.
42.23.12.1^became then friends - both herod and - pilate on that - day with one another;
42.23.12.2^previously it had been that for at enmity they were between themselves.
42.23.13.1^pilate then, having called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
42.23.14.1^said to them, you brought to me the man this, as misleading the people;
42.23.14.2^and behold, i before you having examined him, nothing found in the man this guilty of that accusation you are bringing against him.
42.23.15.1^no, not even herod did;
42.23.15.2^he sent back for him to us.
42.23.15.3^and behold, nothing worthy of death is done by him.
42.23.16.1^having chastised therefore him, i will release him.
42.23.18.1^they cried out however all together, saying, away with this man, release now to us - barabbas,
42.23.19.1^who was on account of insurrection a certain having been made in the city, and murder, having been cast into the prison.
42.23.20.1^again therefore - pilate called to them, wishing to release - jesus.
42.23.21.1^- but they were crying out, saying, crucify, crucify him.
42.23.22.1^- and a third time he said to them, what for evil did commit this man?
42.23.22.2^no cause of death found i in him.
42.23.22.3^having chastised therefore him, i will release him.
42.23.23.1^- but they were urgent, with voices loud, asking for him to be crucified.
42.23.23.2^and were prevailing the voices of them.
42.23.24.1^and pilate sentenced to be done the demand of them.
42.23.25.1^he released then the one on account of insurrection and murder having been cast into prison, whom they had asked for;
42.23.25.2^- and jesus he delivered to the will of them.
42.23.26.1^and as they led away him, having laid hold on simon, a certain of cyrene, coming from the country, they put upon him the cross, to carry behind - jesus.
42.23.27.1^were following now him a great multitude of the people, and of women, who were mourning and lamenting for him.
42.23.28.1^having turned then to them, - jesus said, daughters of jerusalem, not weep for me, but for yourselves weep, and for the children of you.
42.23.29.1^for behold, are coming days in which they will say, blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never did bear, and breasts that never nursed.
42.23.30.1^then they will begin to say to the mountains, fall upon us, and to the hills, cover us.
42.23.31.1^for if in the green tree, these things they do;
42.23.31.2^in the dry, what might take place?
42.23.32.1^were being led away now also other criminals two, with him to be put to death.
42.23.33.1^and when they came to the place - called the skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one - on the right;
42.23.33.2^one now on the left.
42.23.34.1^- and jesus was saying, father, forgive them, not for they know what they do.
42.23.34.2^dividing then the garments of him, they cast lots.
42.23.35.1^and stood the people beholding.
42.23.35.2^were deriding him then also the rulers, saying, others he saved;
42.23.35.3^let him save himself if this is the christ - of god, the chosen one.
42.23.36.1^mocked then him also the soldiers, coming near, sour wine offering him,
42.23.37.1^and saying, if you are the king of the jews, save yourself!
42.23.38.1^there was now also an inscription over him, the king of the jews this.
42.23.39.1^one now of the having been hanged criminals was railing at him, saying not you are if the christ?
42.23.39.2^save yourself and us!
42.23.40.1^answering now, the other was rebuking him, saying, not even do fear you - god, that under the same judgment you are,
42.23.41.1^and we indeed justly?
42.23.41.2^worthy for of what we did we are receiving;
42.23.41.3^this man however nothing wrong did.
42.23.42.1^and he was saying, jesus, remember me when you come into the kingdom of you!
42.23.43.1^and he said to him, truly to you i say, today with me you will be in - paradise.
42.23.44.1^and it was now about the hour sixth, and darkness came over all the land until the hour ninth.
42.23.45.1^the sun was darkened;
42.23.45.2^was torn then the veil of the temple in the middle.
42.23.46.1^and having called out in a voice loud, - jesus said, father, into the hands of you i commit the spirit of me.
42.23.46.2^this now having said, he breathed his last.
42.23.47.1^having seen now the centurion that having taken place, he began glorifying - god, saying, certainly the man this righteous was.
42.23.48.1^and all the having come together crowds to the spectacle this, having seen the things having taken place, beating the breasts were returning home.
42.23.49.1^stood now all those who knew him from afar off, also women, those having followed him from - galilee, beholding these things.
42.23.50.1^and behold, a man named joseph, a council member, being also a man good and righteous,
42.23.51.1^he not was having consented to the counsel and the deed of them, from arimathea, a city of the jews, who was waiting for the kingdom - of god.
42.23.52.1^he having gone - to pilate, asked for the body - of jesus.
42.23.53.1^and having taken it down, he wrapped it in a linen cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in a rock, in which no had been no one not yet laid.
42.23.54.1^and the day it was of preparation, and sabbath was just beginning.
42.23.55.1^having followed then, the women who were come out of - galilee with him, saw the tomb and how was laid the body of him.
42.23.56.1^having returned then, they prepared spices and anointing oils.
42.23.56.2^and on the indeed sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
42.24.1.1^the however first day of the week, dawn very early, to the tomb they came, bringing that they had prepared spices.
42.24.2.1^they found then the stone having been rolled away from the tomb.
42.24.3.1^having entered however, not they found the body of the lord jesus.
42.24.4.1^and it came to pass while - are perplexed they about this, that behold, men two stood by them in garments dazzling.
42.24.5.1^terrified then having become of them and bowing the faces to the ground, they said to them, why seek you the living among the dead?
42.24.6.1^not he is here, but he is risen!
42.24.6.2^remember how he spoke to you, yet being in - galilee,
42.24.7.1^saying, the son - of man - it behooves to be delivered into hands of men sinful, and to be crucified, and the third day to arise.
42.24.8.1^and they remembered the words of him.
42.24.9.1^and having returned from the tomb, they related these things all to the eleven and to all the rest.
42.24.10.1^it was now - magdalene mary, and joanna, and mary the mother of james, and the other women with them, telling to the apostles these things.
42.24.11.1^and appeared before them like folly the words of them, and they did not believe them.
42.24.12.1^- but peter, having risen up, ran to the tomb, and having stooped down, he sees the linen strips only, and he went away, in himself wondering at that having come to pass.
42.24.13.1^and behold, two of them on same the day were going to a village being distant, stadia sixty from jerusalem, whose name is emmaus;
42.24.14.1^and they were talking with one another about all - having taken place these things.
42.24.15.1^and it came to pass in the talking of them and reasoning, that himself jesus, having drawn near, was walking along with them;
42.24.16.1^- but the eyes of them were held - not to know him.
42.24.17.1^he said then to them, what - words are these that you exchange with one another walking?
42.24.17.2^and they stood still, looking sad.
42.24.18.1^answering now, the one named cleopas said to him, you alone visit jerusalem and not have known the things having come to pass in it in the days these?
42.24.19.1^and he said to them, what things?
42.24.19.2^- and they said to him, the things concerning jesus of nazareth, who was a man, a prophet mighty in deed and word before - god and all the people;
42.24.20.1^that then delivered up him the chief priests and the rulers of us to the judgment of death, and crucified him.
42.24.21.1^we however were hoping - he it is who is about to redeem - israel.
42.24.21.2^but indeed also with all these things, the third this day brings, away from which these things came to pass.
42.24.22.1^however also women certain out from us astonished us.
42.24.22.2^having been early to the tomb
42.24.23.1^and not having found the body of him, they came declaring also a vision of angels to have seen, who say he is alive.
42.24.24.1^and went some of those with us to the tomb and found it so, as also the women said;
42.24.24.2^him however not they saw.
42.24.25.1^and he said to them, o foolish and slow - of heart - to believe in all that have spoken the prophets.
42.24.26.1^not these things was it necessary for to suffer the christ and to enter into the glory of him?
42.24.27.1^and having begun from moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.
42.24.28.1^and they drew near to the village where they were going, and he appeared farther to be going.
42.24.29.1^and they constrained him, saying, abide with us, for toward evening it is, and has declined now the day.
42.24.29.2^and he entered in - to abide with them.
42.24.30.1^and it came to pass in the reclining of him with them, having taken the bread he blessed it, and having broken it, he began giving it to them.
42.24.31.1^of them then were opened the eyes, and they knew him.
42.24.31.2^and he vanished being seen from them.
42.24.32.1^and they said to one another, not the heart of us burning was within us as he was speaking with us on the road, as he was opening to us the scriptures?
42.24.33.1^and having risen up that same - hour, they returned to jerusalem, and they found gathered together the eleven and those with them,
42.24.34.1^saying -, indeed has risen the lord and he has appeared to simon.
42.24.35.1^and they began relating the things on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.
42.24.36.1^these things now of them as they were telling, he himself stood in midst of them and says to them, peace to you.
42.24.37.1^having been terrified however, and filled with fear having been, they were thinking themselves a spirit to see.
42.24.38.1^and he said to them, why troubled are you, and through why doubts do come up in the hearts of you?
42.24.39.1^see the hands of me and the feet of me, that i am he.
42.24.39.2^touch me and see, for a spirit flesh and bones not has, as me you see having.
42.24.40.1^and this having said, he showed to them the hands and the feet.
42.24.41.1^still now, while they were disbelieving of them for the joy and amazement, he said to them, have you anything to eat here?
42.24.42.1^- and they gave to him of a fish broiled part.
42.24.43.1^and having taken it, before them he ate it.
42.24.44.1^he said now unto to them, these are the words of me, which i spoke to you still being with you, that it behooves to be fulfilled all things - having been written in the law of moses, and the prophets and the psalms concerning me.
42.24.45.1^then he opened their - mind - to understand the scriptures.
42.24.46.1^and he said to them -, thus it has been written:
42.24.46.2^was to suffer the christ, and to rise out from the dead the third day;
42.24.47.1^and to be proclaimed in the name of him repentance and forgiveness of sins to all - nations, having begun from jerusalem.
42.24.48.1^you are witnesses of these things.
42.24.49.1^and behold, i am sending the promise of the father of me upon you;
42.24.49.2^you however remain in the city until that you should be clothed with from on high power.
42.24.50.1^he led now them out as far as to bethany, and having lifted up the hands of him, he blessed them.
42.24.51.1^and it came to pass in the blessing of him them, he was separated from them and was carried up into - heaven.
42.24.52.1^and they having worshiped him, returned to jerusalem with joy great,
42.24.53.1^and were continually all in the temple, blessing - god.
43.1.1.1^in the beginning was the word, and the word was with - god, and god was the word.
43.1.2.1^he was in the beginning with - god.
43.1.3.1^all things through him came into being, and without him came into being not even one thing that has come into being.
43.1.4.1^in him life was, and the life was the light - of men.
43.1.5.1^and the light in the darkness shines, and the darkness it not overcame.
43.1.6.1^there came a man having been sent from god;
43.1.6.2^the name to him was john.
43.1.7.1^he came as a witness, that he might testify concerning the light, that all might believe through him.
43.1.8.1^not was he the light, but that he might witness concerning the light.
43.1.9.1^was the light - true, who enlightens every man, coming into the world.
43.1.10.1^in the world he was, and the world through him came into being, and the world him not knew.
43.1.11.1^to the own he came, and the own him not received.
43.1.12.1^as many as however received him, he gave to them authority children of god to be, to those believing in the name of him,
43.1.13.1^who not of blood, nor of will of flesh, nor of will of man, but of god were born.
43.1.14.1^and the word flesh became and dwelt among us, and we beheld the glory of him, a glory as of an only begotten from the father, full of grace and truth.
43.1.15.1^john witnesses concerning him, and he cried out, saying, this was he of whom i was saying, the one after me coming, precedence over me has, because before me he was.
43.1.16.1^for from the fullness of him, we all have received then grace for grace.
43.1.17.1^for the law through moses was given;
43.1.17.2^- grace and - truth through jesus christ came.
43.1.18.1^god no one has seen ever yet;
43.1.18.2^the only begotten god, the one being in the bosom of the father, he has made him known.
43.1.19.1^and this is the testimony - of john, when sent to him the jews from jerusalem, priests and levites, that they might ask him, you, who are?
43.1.20.1^and he confessed and not denied, but confessed -, i not am the christ.
43.1.21.1^and they asked him, what then?
43.1.21.2^you elijah are?
43.1.21.3^and he says, not i am.
43.1.21.4^the prophet are you?
43.1.21.5^and he answered, no.
43.1.22.1^they said therefore to him, who are you?
43.1.22.2^that an answer we might give to those having sent us;
43.1.22.3^what say you about yourself?
43.1.23.1^he was saying, i am a voice crying in the wilderness, make straight the way of the lord,   as said isaiah the prophet.
43.1.24.1^and those having been sent were out from the pharisees.
43.1.25.1^and they asked him and said to him, why then baptize you, if you not are the christ, nor elijah, nor the prophet?
43.1.26.1^answered them - john saying, i baptize with water;
43.1.26.2^but in the midst of you stands one whom you not know,
43.1.27.1^the one after me coming, of whom not am i worthy that i should untie of him the strap of the sandal.
43.1.28.1^these things in bethany took place, across the jordan, where was - john baptizing.
43.1.29.1^on the next day he sees - jesus coming to him and says, behold the lamb - of god, - taking away the sin of the world.
43.1.30.1^he it is concerning whom i said, after me comes a man, who precedence over me has, because before me he was.
43.1.31.1^and i not knew him;
43.1.31.2^but that he might be revealed - to israel, because of this, came i with water baptizing.
43.1.32.1^and bore witness john saying -, i have beheld the spirit, descending as a dove out of heaven, and it remained upon him.
43.1.33.1^and i not knew him;
43.1.33.2^but the one having sent me to baptize with water, he to me said, upon whom - you shall see the spirit descending and abiding on him, he is the one baptizing with the spirit holy.
43.1.34.1^and i have seen and have borne witness that this is the son - of god.
43.1.35.1^on the next day again was standing - john, and of the disciples of him two.
43.1.36.1^and having looked at - jesus walking, he says, behold the lamb - of god!
43.1.37.1^and heard the two disciples him speaking, and followed - jesus.
43.1.38.1^having turned then - jesus, and having beheld them following, he says to them, what seek you?
43.1.38.2^- and they said to him, rabbi which is to say, being translated, teacher   where are you staying?
43.1.39.1^he says to them, come and you will see.
43.1.39.2^they went therefore and saw where he abides;
43.1.39.3^and with him they stayed the day that.
43.1.39.4^the hour was about the tenth.
43.1.40.1^was andrew, the brother of simon peter, one of the two - having heard from john, and having followed him.
43.1.41.1^finds he first the brother - own simon, and he says to him, we have found the messiah, which is translated christ.
43.1.42.1^he led him to - jesus.
43.1.42.2^having looked at him, - jesus said, you are simon the son of john;
43.1.42.3^you will be called cephas which means peter.
43.1.43.1^on the next day he desired to go forth into - galilee.
43.1.43.2^and he finds philip.
43.1.43.3^and says to him - jesus, follow me.
43.1.44.1^was now - philip from bethsaida, from the city of andrew and peter.
43.1.45.1^finds philip - nathanael and says to him, him whom wrote of moses in the law, also the prophets, we have found, jesus son - of joseph, - of nazareth.
43.1.46.1^and said to him nathanael, out of nazareth is able any good thing to be?
43.1.46.2^says to him - philip, come and see.
43.1.47.1^saw - jesus - nathanael coming to him, and he says concerning him, behold truly an israelite, in whom deceit not there is.
43.1.48.1^says to him nathanael, from where me know you?
43.1.48.2^answered jesus and said to him, before - you philip calling, being under the fig tree, i saw you.
43.1.49.1^answered him nathanael, rabbi, you are the son - of god;
43.1.49.2^you king are - of israel.
43.1.50.1^answered jesus and said to him, because i said to you that i saw you under the fig tree, believe you?
43.1.50.2^greater things than these you will see.
43.1.51.1^and he says to him, truly, truly, i say to all of you, you will see the heaven opened and the angels - of god ascending and descending on the son - of man.
43.2.1.1^and on the day - third a wedding took place in cana - of galilee, and was the mother - of jesus there.
43.2.2.1^was invited then also - jesus and the disciples of him to the wedding.
43.2.3.1^and having been deficient of wine, says the mother - of jesus to him, wine not they have.
43.2.4.1^and says to her - jesus, what to me and to you, woman?
43.2.4.2^not yet is come the hour of me.
43.2.5.1^says the mother of him to the servants, whatever anyhow - he may say to you, do.
43.2.6.1^there were now there of stone, water jars six, according to the purification of the jews, standing, having space for metretae two or three.
43.2.7.1^says to them - jesus, fill the jars with water.
43.2.7.2^and they filled them up to the brim.
43.2.8.1^and he says to them, draw out now and carry to the master of the feast.
43.2.8.2^- and they carried it.
43.2.9.1^when then had tasted the master of the feast the water wine having become, and not he knew from where it is   the however servants knew - having drawn the water   calls the bridegroom the master of the feast
43.2.10.1^and says to him, every man first the good wine sets out, and when they might have drunk freely, the inferior;
43.2.10.2^you have kept the good wine until now.
43.2.11.1^this did, the beginning of the signs, - jesus in cana - of galilee, and he revealed the glory of him, and believed in him the disciples of him.
43.2.12.1^after this he went down to capernaum, he and the mother of him and the brothers of him and the disciples of him, and there they stayed not many days.
43.2.13.1^and near was the passover of the jews, and went up to jerusalem - jesus.
43.2.14.1^and he found in the temple those selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers sitting.
43.2.15.1^and having made a whip of cords, all he drove out from the temple, - both sheep and - oxen;
43.2.15.2^and of the money changers he poured out the coins, and the tables he overthrew.
43.2.16.1^and to those - doves selling he said, take these things from here;
43.2.16.2^not make the house of the father of me a house of trade.
43.2.17.1^remembered the disciples of him that written it is:
43.2.17.2^the zeal of the house of you will consume me.
43.2.18.1^answered therefore the jews and said to him, what sign show you to us, that these things you do?
43.2.19.1^answered jesus and said to them, destroy the temple this, and in three days i will raise up it.
43.2.20.1^said therefore the jews, forty and six years was built the temple this, and you in three days will raise up it?
43.2.21.1^he however was speaking concerning the temple of the body of him.
43.2.22.1^when therefore he was raised up out from the dead, remembered the disciples of him that this he had said, and they believed the scripture and the word that had spoken - jesus.
43.2.23.1^when then he was in - jerusalem in the passover, in the feast, many believed in the name of him, beholding of him the signs that he was doing.
43.2.24.1^on his part however jesus not did entrust himself to them, because of - his knowing all men,
43.2.25.1^and because no need he had that anyone should testify concerning the man;
43.2.25.2^he himself for knew what was in the man.
43.3.1.1^there was now a man of the pharisees, nicodemus name to him, a ruler of the jews;
43.3.2.1^he came to him by night and said to him, rabbi, we know that from god you have come, a teacher;
43.3.2.2^no one for is able these - signs to do that you do, if not should be - god with him.
43.3.3.1^answered jesus and said to him, truly, truly i say to you, if not anyone be born from above, not he is able to see the kingdom - of god.
43.3.4.1^says to him - nicodemus, how is able a man to be born, old being?
43.3.4.2^not is he able into the womb of the mother of him a second time to enter, and to be born?
43.3.5.1^answered jesus, truly, truly, i say to you, if not anyone be born of water and of the spirit, not he is able to enter into the kingdom - of god.
43.3.6.1^that having been born of the flesh, flesh is;
43.3.6.2^and that having been born of the spirit, spirit is.
43.3.7.1^not do wonder that i said to you, it is necessary for you all to be born from above.
43.3.8.1^the wind where it wishes blows, and the sound of it you hear, but not you know from where it comes, and where it goes;
43.3.8.2^thus is everyone - having been born of the spirit.
43.3.9.1^answered nicodemus and said to him, how are able these things to be?
43.3.10.1^answered jesus and said to him, you are the teacher - of israel, and these things not know?
43.3.11.1^truly, truly, i say to you that what we know we speak, and what we have seen we bear witness to;
43.3.11.2^and the witness of us not you people receive.
43.3.12.1^if things earthly i have told you, and not you believe, how if i tell to you the things heavenly, will you believe?
43.3.13.1^and no one has gone up into - heaven if not the one out of - heaven having come down, the son - of man.
43.3.14.1^and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus to be lifted up it behooves the son - of man,
43.3.15.1^so that everyone - believing in him may have life eternal.
43.3.16.1^thus for loved - god the world, that the son, the only begotten, he gave, so that everyone - believing in him not should perish, but should have life eternal.
43.3.17.1^not for sent - god - his son into the world that he might judge the world, but that might be saved the world through him.
43.3.18.1^the one believing on him not is judged;
43.3.18.2^the one but not believing already has been judged, because not he has believed in the name of the only begotten son - of god.
43.3.19.1^this now is the judgement, that the light has come into the world, and loved - men rather the darkness than the light;
43.3.19.2^were for of them evil the deeds.
43.3.20.1^everyone for - evil practicing hates the light and not comes to the light, so that not may be exposed the works of him;
43.3.21.1^the one however practicing the truth comes to the light, that may be manifest his - works that in god have been done.
43.3.22.1^after these things came - jesus and the disciples of him into the judean land, and there he was staying with them, and was baptizing.
43.3.23.1^was now also - john baptizing in aenon, near - salim, because waters many were there, and they were coming and being baptized.
43.3.24.1^not yet for had been cast into the prison - john.
43.3.25.1^arose then a debate among the disciples of john, with a certain jew, about purification.
43.3.26.1^and they came to - john and said to him, rabbi, he who was with you beyond the jordan, to whom you have borne witness, behold he baptizes, and all are coming to him.
43.3.27.1^answered john and said, nothing is able a man to receive, nothing one if not it is given to him from - heaven.
43.3.28.1^yourselves you to me bear witness, that i said, - not am i the christ, but - sent i am before him.
43.3.29.1^the one having the bride, the bridegroom is;
43.3.29.2^the now friend of the bridegroom, the one standing and listening for him, with joy rejoices because of the voice of the bridegroom.
43.3.29.3^this therefore, the joy - of mine, is fulfilled.
43.3.30.1^him it behooves to increase;
43.3.30.2^me however to decrease.
43.3.31.1^the one from above coming, above all is.
43.3.31.2^the one being from the earth, from the earth is, and from the earth speaks.
43.3.31.3^the one from - heaven coming, above all is.
43.3.32.1^what he has seen and heard, this he testifies;
43.3.32.2^and the testimony of him, no one receives.
43.3.33.1^the one having received his - testimony has set his seal that - god true is.
43.3.34.1^he whom for sent - god, the words - of god speaks, not for by measure he gives the spirit.
43.3.35.1^the father loves the son, and all things has given into the hand of him.
43.3.36.1^the one believing in the son has life eternal;
43.3.36.2^the one however not obeying the son, not will see life, but the wrath - of god abides on him.
43.4.1.1^when therefore knew - jesus that heard the pharisees that jesus more disciples makes and baptizes than john
43.4.2.1^although indeed jesus himself not was baptizing, but the disciples of him
43.4.3.1^he left - judea, and went away again into - galilee.
43.4.4.1^it was necessary for now him to pass through - samaria.
43.4.5.1^he comes therefore to a city - of samaria called sychar, near the plot of ground that had given jacob to joseph, the son of him.
43.4.6.1^was now there the well - of jacob.
43.4.6.2^- therefore jesus, being wearied from the journey, was sitting thus at the well.
43.4.6.3^the hour was about the sixth.
43.4.7.1^comes a woman out of - samaria to draw water.
43.4.7.2^says to her - jesus, give me to drink.
43.4.8.1^- for the disciples of him had gone away into the city, that food they might buy.
43.4.9.1^says therefore to him the woman - samaritan, how you a jew being, from me to drink do ask, a woman samaritan being?
43.4.9.2^not for have association jews with samaritans.
43.4.10.1^answered jesus and said to her, if you had known the gift - of god, and who it is - saying to you, give me to drink, you - would have asked him, and he would have given - to you water living.
43.4.11.1^says to him the woman sir, nothing to draw with you have, and the well is deep;
43.4.11.2^from where then have you the water - living?
43.4.12.1^not you greater than are the father of us jacob, who gave us the well, and himself of it drank, and the sons of him, and the livestock of him?
43.4.13.1^answered jesus and said to her, everyone - drinking of the water this will thirst again;
43.4.14.1^whoever however - may drink of the water that i will give him, never not will thirst, to the age.
43.4.14.2^instead, the water that i will give to him will become in him a spring of water, welling up into life eternal.
43.4.15.1^says to him the woman, sir, give me this - water, that not i might thirst, nor come here to draw.
43.4.16.1^he says to her, go, call the husband of you and come here.
43.4.17.1^answered the woman and said to him not i have a husband.
43.4.17.2^says to her - jesus, correctly you have spoken -, a husband not i have.
43.4.18.1^five for husbands you have had, and now he whom you have, not is your husband;
43.4.18.2^this truly you have spoken.
43.4.19.1^says to him the woman, sir, i understand that a prophet are you.
43.4.20.1^the fathers of us on the mountain this worshiped, and you say that in jerusalem is the place where to worship it is necessary.
43.4.21.1^says to her - jesus, believe me, woman, that is coming an hour when neither on the mountain this, nor in jerusalem, will you worship the father.
43.4.22.1^you worship what not you know;
43.4.22.2^we worship what we know, for - salvation of the jews is.
43.4.23.1^but is coming an hour and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and truth;
43.4.23.2^also for the father such seeks, who worship him.
43.4.24.1^spirit - god is, and those worshiping him in spirit and truth it behooves to worship.
43.4.25.1^says to him the woman, i know that messiah is coming, who is called christ;
43.4.25.2^when comes he, he will tell us all things.
43.4.26.1^says to her - jesus, i am he, the one speaking to you.
43.4.27.1^and upon this came the disciples of him, and were amazed that with a woman he was speaking;
43.4.27.2^no one however said, what seek you?
43.4.27.3^or why speak you with her?
43.4.28.1^left then the water pot of her the woman, and went away into the city, and says to the men,
43.4.29.1^come, see a man who told me all things whatever i did.
43.4.29.2^can it be that this is the christ?
43.4.30.1^they went forth out of the city and were coming unto him.
43.4.31.1^but in the meantime were asking him the disciples, saying, rabbi, eat.
43.4.32.1^- but he said to them, i food have to eat that you not know.
43.4.33.1^were saying therefore the disciples to one another, no one did bring him anything to eat?
43.4.34.1^says to them - jesus, my food is that i should do the will of the one having sent me, and should finish of him the work.
43.4.35.1^not you say that yet four months it is, and the harvest comes?
43.4.35.2^behold, i say to you, lift up the eyes of you and see the fields, because white they are toward harvest already!
43.4.36.1^the one reaping a reward receives and gathers fruit unto life eternal, so that the one sowing together may rejoice, and the one reaping.
43.4.37.1^in for this the saying is true -, one is - sowing, and another - reaping.
43.4.38.1^i sent you to reap what not you have toiled for;
43.4.38.2^others have toiled, and you into the labor of them have entered.
43.4.39.1^out of now the city that, many believed in him of the samaritans, because of the word of the woman testifying -, he told me all things whatever i did.
43.4.40.1^when therefore came to him the samaritans, they were asking him to abide with them, and he stayed there two days.
43.4.41.1^and many more believed, because of the word of him;
43.4.42.1^- and to the woman they were saying -, no longer because of - your speech we believe;
43.4.42.2^we ourselves for have heard, and we know that this is truly the savior of the world.
43.4.43.1^after then the two days, he went forth from there into - galilee.
43.4.44.1^himself for jesus testified that a prophet in the own hometown, honor not has.
43.4.45.1^when therefore he came into - galilee, received him the galileans, all things having seen how great he had done in jerusalem during the feast;
43.4.45.2^also themselves for they had gone to the feast.
43.4.46.1^he came therefore again to - cana - of galilee, where he had made the water wine.
43.4.46.2^and there was a certain royal official whose - son was sick in capernaum.
43.4.47.1^he, having heard that jesus had come out of - judea into - galilee, went to him and was asking that he would come down and heal his - son;
43.4.47.2^he was about for to die.
43.4.48.1^said therefore - jesus to him, if not signs and wonders you people see, no not will you believe.
43.4.49.1^says to him the royal official, sir, come down before dies the child of me.
43.4.50.1^says to him - jesus, go, the son of you lives.
43.4.50.2^believed the man the word that said to him - jesus, and he went on his way.
43.4.51.1^already then as he is going down, the servants of him met him, saying that the boy of him lives.
43.4.52.1^he inquired therefore the hour from them in which better he got.
43.4.52.2^they said therefore to him -, yesterday at the hour seventh, left him the fever.
43.4.53.1^knew therefore the father that it was in that the hour at which said to him - jesus, the son of you lives.
43.4.53.2^and he believed himself, and the household of him all.
43.4.54.1^this is now again the second sign did - jesus, having come out of - judea into - galilee.
43.5.1.1^after these things there was a feast of the jews, and went up jesus to jerusalem.
43.5.2.1^there is now in - jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool, - called in hebrew bethesda, five porches having.
43.5.3.1^in these were lying a multitude of those ailing, blind, lame, paralyzed.
43.5.5.1^was now a certain man there, thirty and eight years being in - infirmity himself.
43.5.6.1^him having seen - jesus lying, and having known that a long already time he has been, he says to him, desire you well to become?
43.5.7.1^answered him the one ailing, sir, a man not i have, that when has been stirred the water, he might put me into the pool, in which now am going i, another before me descends.
43.5.8.1^says to him - jesus, arise, take up the mat of you, and walk.
43.5.9.1^and immediately became well the man, and he took up the mat of him and began to walk.
43.5.9.2^it was now sabbath on that - day.
43.5.10.1^were saying therefore the jews to the one having been healed, sabbath it is, and not it is lawful for you to take up the mat of you,
43.5.11.1^who however answered them, the one having made me well, that one to me said, take up the mat of you and walk.
43.5.12.1^they asked him, who is the man - having said to you, take up and walk?
43.5.13.1^the one now having been healed not knew who it is, - for jesus had moved away, a crowd being in the place.
43.5.14.1^after these things finds him - jesus in the temple and said to him, behold, well you have become;
43.5.14.2^no more sin, that not worse to you something happens.
43.5.15.1^went away the man and told the jews that jesus it is the one having made him well.
43.5.16.1^and because of this, were persecuting the jews - jesus, because these things he was doing on the sabbath.
43.5.17.1^- but jesus answered them, the father of me until now is working, and i am working.
43.5.18.1^because of this therefore, the more were seeking him the jews to kill, because not only was he breaking the sabbath, but also father his own he was calling - god, equal himself making to god.
43.5.19.1^answered therefore - jesus and was saying to them, truly, truly, i say to you, not is able the son to do of himself nothing, if not anything he might see the father doing;
43.5.19.2^whatever for - he does, these things also the son likewise does.
43.5.20.1^- for the father loves the son, and all things shows to him that he does;
43.5.20.2^and greater than these he will show him works, so that you may marvel.
43.5.21.1^even as for the father raises up the dead and gives life, thus also the son to whom he will, gives life.
43.5.22.1^not even for the father judges no one, but - judgment all has given to the son,
43.5.23.1^so that all may honor the son, even as they honor the father.
43.5.23.2^he who not is honoring the son, not is honoring the father, the one having sent him.
43.5.24.1^truly, truly i say to you that the one the word of me hearing, and believing the one having sent me, he has life eternal and into judgment not comes, but has passed out of - death into - life.
43.5.25.1^truly, truly, i say to you that is coming an hour, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the son - of god, and those having heard will live.
43.5.26.1^as for the father has life in himself, so also to the son he gave life, to have in himself.
43.5.27.1^and authority he gave him judgment to execute, because son of man he is.
43.5.28.1^not marvel at this, for is coming an hour in which all those in the tombs will hear the voice of him,
43.5.29.1^and will come forth   those - good having done, to the resurrection of life;
43.5.29.2^- and those evil having done, to the resurrection of judgment.
43.5.30.1^not am able i to do of myself nothing;
43.5.30.2^as i hear, i judge;
43.5.30.3^and the judgment - of me just is, because not i seek the will - of me, but the will of the one having sent me.
43.5.31.1^if i bear witness concerning myself, the testimony of me not is true.
43.5.32.1^another it is - bearing witness concerning me, and i know that true is the testimony which he bears witness concerning me.
43.5.33.1^you have sent unto john and he has borne witness to the truth.
43.5.34.1^i now not from man the testimony receive, but these things i say that you may be saved.
43.5.35.1^he was the lamp - burning and shining;
43.5.35.2^you now were willing to rejoice for a season in the light of him.
43.5.36.1^i however have the testimony greater than that of john.
43.5.36.2^- for the works that has given me the father that i should complete them, same the works which i do, bear witness concerning me that the father me has sent.
43.5.37.1^and the one having sent me, the father himself, has borne witness concerning me.
43.5.37.2^neither voice of him at any time have you heard, nor form of him have you seen.
43.5.38.1^and the word of him not you have in you abiding;
43.5.38.2^for whom sent he, him you not believe.
43.5.39.1^you diligently search the scriptures, for you think in them life eternal to have;
43.5.39.2^and these are they - bearing witness concerning me;
43.5.40.1^and not you are willing to come to me that life you may have.
43.5.41.1^glory from men not i take;
43.5.42.1^but i have known you, that the love - of god not you have in yourselves.
43.5.43.1^i have come in the name of the father of me, and not you receive me;
43.5.43.2^if another should come in the name the own, him you will receive.
43.5.44.1^how are able you to believe, glory from one another receiving, and the glory that is from the only god, not you seek?
43.5.45.1^not think that i will accuse you to the father.
43.5.45.2^there is one accusing you, moses, in whom you have hoped.
43.5.46.1^if for you were believing moses, you would have believed - me;
43.5.46.2^concerning for me he wrote.
43.5.47.1^if now - his writings not you believe, how - my words will you believe?
43.6.1.1^after these things went away - jesus over the sea - of galilee   - of tiberias.
43.6.2.1^was following now him a crowd great, because they were seeing the signs which he was doing upon those being sick.
43.6.3.1^went up now on the mountain jesus, and there he was sitting with the disciples of him.
43.6.4.1^was now near the passover, the feast of the jews.
43.6.5.1^having lifted up then the eyes - jesus and having seen that a great crowd is coming to him, he says to philip, from where shall we buy bread that might eat these?
43.6.6.1^this now he was saying testing him;
43.6.6.2^he for knew what he was about to do.
43.6.7.1^answered him - philip, two hundred denarii worth of loaves not are sufficient for them that each little piece one might receive.
43.6.8.1^says to him one of the disciples of him, andrew, the brother of simon peter,
43.6.9.1^is a little boy here, who has five loaves barley and two small fish;
43.6.9.2^but these what are for so many?
43.6.10.1^said - jesus, make the men to recline.
43.6.10.2^there was now grass much in the place.
43.6.10.3^reclined therefore the men, the number about five thousand.
43.6.11.1^took then the loaves - jesus, and having given thanks, he distributed to those reclining;
43.6.11.2^likewise also of the fish, as much as they wished.
43.6.12.1^when now they were filled, he says to the disciples of him, gather together the having been over and above fragments, so that nothing anything may be lost.
43.6.13.1^they gathered together therefore, and filled twelve hand-baskets of fragments from the five loaves - barley which were over and above to those having eaten.
43.6.14.1^the therefore people, having seen what he had done, the sign, were saying -, this is truly the prophet who is coming into the world.
43.6.15.1^jesus therefore, having known that they are about to come and to seize him that they might make him king, withdrew again to the mountain himself alone.
43.6.16.1^when now evening it became, went down the disciples of him to the sea,
43.6.17.1^and having entered into a boat, they were going over the sea to capernaum.
43.6.17.2^and dark already it had become, and not had come to them - jesus.
43.6.18.1^- and the sea by a wind strong blowing was agitated.
43.6.19.1^having rowed therefore about stadia twenty five or thirty, they see - jesus walking on the sea, and near the boat coming, and they were frightened.
43.6.20.1^- and he says to them, i am he;
43.6.20.2^not fear.
43.6.21.1^they were willing then to receive him into the boat, and immediately was the boat at the land to which they were going.
43.6.22.1^on the next day the crowd - standing on the other side of the sea, having seen that boat other no was there if not one, and that not went with the disciples of him - jesus into the boat, but alone the disciples of him went away;
43.6.23.1^but other came boats from tiberias, near the place where they ate the bread, having given thanks the lord.
43.6.24.1^when therefore saw the crowd that jesus not is there, nor the disciples of him, they entered themselves into the boats and came to capernaum, seeking - jesus.
43.6.25.1^and having found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, rabbi, when here have you come?
43.6.26.1^answered them - jesus and said, truly, truly, i say to you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were satisfied.
43.6.27.1^work not for the food that is perishing, but for the food - enduring unto life eternal, which the son - of man to you will give.
43.6.27.2^him for the father has sealed, - god.
43.6.28.1^they said therefore to him, what must we do, that we may be doing the works - of god?
43.6.29.1^answered - jesus and said to them, this is the work - of god, that you should believe in him whom has sent he.
43.6.30.1^they said therefore to him, what then do you as a sign, that we may see and may believe you?
43.6.30.2^what work do you perform?
43.6.31.1^the fathers of us the manna ate in the wilderness, as it is written:
43.6.31.2^bread from - heaven he gave them to eat.
43.6.32.1^said therefore to them - jesus, truly, truly, i say to you, not moses has given you the bread from - heaven, but the father of me gives you the bread from - heaven - true.
43.6.33.1^the for bread - of god is the one coming down out of - heaven and life giving to the world.
43.6.34.1^they said therefore to him, sir, always give to us the bread this.
43.6.35.1^said to them - jesus, i am the bread - of life;
43.6.35.2^the one coming to me never not shall hunger, and the one believing in me no not shall thirst at any time.
43.6.36.1^but i said to you that also you have seen me, and yet not believe.
43.6.37.1^all that gives me the father, to me will come, and the one coming to me, no not shall i cast out.
43.6.38.1^for i have come down from - heaven, not that i should do the will - of me, but the will of the one having sent me.
43.6.39.1^this now is the will of the one having sent me, that all that he has given me, none i should lose of it, but will raise up it in the last day.
43.6.40.1^this for is the will of the father of me, that everyone - beholding the son and believing in him should have life eternal, and will raise up him i in the last day.
43.6.41.1^were grumbling therefore the jews about him because he said, i am the bread - having come down from - heaven.
43.6.42.1^and they were saying, not this is jesus the son of joseph, of whom we know the father and the mother?
43.6.42.2^how then says he -, from - heaven i have come down?
43.6.43.1^answered jesus and said to them, not grumble with one another.
43.6.44.1^no one is able to come to me, if not the father, the one having sent me, draws him, and i will raise up him in the last day.
43.6.45.1^it is written in the prophets:
43.6.45.2^and they will be all taught of god.
43.6.45.3^everyone - having heard from the father and having learned, comes to me.
43.6.46.1^not that the father has seen anyone, if not the one being from - god;
43.6.46.2^he has seen the father.
43.6.47.1^truly, truly, i say to you, the one believing has life eternal.
43.6.48.1^i am the bread - of life.
43.6.49.1^the fathers of you ate in the wilderness the manna, and died.
43.6.50.1^this is the bread - from - heaven coming down, that anyone of it may eat, and not die.
43.6.51.1^i am the bread - living, - from - heaven having come down;
43.6.51.2^if anyone shall have eaten of this - bread, he will live to the age;
43.6.51.3^and the bread also that i will give, the flesh of me is for the of the world life.
43.6.52.1^were arguing therefore with one another the jews, saying, how is able this man us to give the flesh of him to eat?
43.6.53.1^said therefore to them - jesus, truly, truly, i say to you, if not you shall have eaten the flesh of the son - of man, and shall have drunk of him the blood, not you have life in yourselves.
43.6.54.1^the one eating of me the flesh, and drinking of me the blood, has life eternal, and i will raise up him in the last day.
43.6.55.1^the for flesh of me, true is food, and the blood of me, true is drink.
43.6.56.1^the one eating of me the flesh and drinking of me the blood, in me abides, and i in him.
43.6.57.1^as sent me the living father, and i live because of the father, also the one feeding on me, he also will live because of me.
43.6.58.1^this is the bread - from heaven having come down, not as ate the fathers and died.
43.6.58.2^the one eating this - bread will live to the age.
43.6.59.1^these things he said in the synagogue, teaching in capernaum.
43.6.60.1^many therefore, having heard, of the disciples of him, said, difficult is the word this;
43.6.60.2^who is able it to hear?
43.6.61.1^knowing however - jesus in himself that are grumbling about this the disciples of him, he said to them, this you does offend?
43.6.62.1^what if then you should see the son - of man ascending where he was - before?
43.6.63.1^the spirit it is - giving life;
43.6.63.2^the flesh not profits nothing.
43.6.63.3^the words that i speak to you spirit are, and life they are.
43.6.64.1^but they are of you some who not believe.
43.6.64.2^knew for from the beginning - jesus who are those not believing and who it is who will betray him.
43.6.65.1^and he was saying, because of this have i said to you that no one is able to come to me, if not it shall have been granted to him from the father.
43.6.66.1^from that time, many out of the disciples of him departed to the back and no longer with him walked.
43.6.67.1^said therefore - jesus to the twelve, not also you are wishing to go away?
43.6.68.1^answered him simon peter, lord, to whom will we go?
43.6.68.2^the words of life eternal you have;
43.6.69.1^and we have believed and have known that you are the holy one - of god.
43.6.70.1^answered them - jesus, not i you the twelve did choose, and of you one a devil is?
43.6.71.1^he was speaking now - of judas son of simon iscariot;
43.6.71.2^he for was about to betray him, one of the twelve.
43.7.1.1^and after these things, was walking - jesus in - galilee;
43.7.1.2^not for he did desire in - judea to walk, because were seeking him the jews to kill.
43.7.2.1^was now near the feast of the jews, of booths.
43.7.3.1^said therefore to him the brothers of him, depart from here and go into - judea, so that also the disciples of you will see of you the works that you are doing.
43.7.4.1^no one for anything in secret does and seeks himself in public to be.
43.7.4.2^if these things you do, show yourself to the world.
43.7.5.1^not even for the brothers of him were believing in him.
43.7.6.1^says therefore to them - jesus, the time - of me not yet is come, - but the time - of you always is ready.
43.7.7.1^not is able the world to hate you;
43.7.7.2^me however it hates, because i bear witness concerning it that the works of it evil are.
43.7.8.1^you go up to the feast.
43.7.8.2^i not am going up to the feast this, for - my time not yet has been fulfilled.
43.7.9.1^these things now having said to them, he remained in - galilee.
43.7.10.1^when however had gone up the brothers of him to the feast, then also he went up, not openly, but as in secret.
43.7.11.1^the therefore jews were seeking him at the feast and were saying, where is he?
43.7.12.1^and murmuring about him there was much among the crowds.
43.7.12.2^some indeed were saying -, good he is.
43.7.12.3^others however were saying, no, but he deceives the people.
43.7.13.1^no one however publicly was speaking about him, because of the fear of the jews.
43.7.14.1^now also of the feast being in the middle, went up jesus into the temple and was teaching.
43.7.15.1^were marveling then the jews, saying, how this one writings knows, not having studied?
43.7.16.1^answered therefore them - jesus and said -, my teaching not is of myself, but of the one having sent me.
43.7.17.1^if anyone desires the will of him to do, he will know concerning the teaching, whether from - god it is, or i from myself speak.
43.7.18.1^the one from himself speaking, the glory the own seeks;
43.7.18.2^the one however seeking the glory of the one having sent him, he true is, and unrighteousness in him not is.
43.7.19.1^not moses has given to you the law, and no one of you keeps the law?
43.7.19.2^why me do you seek to kill?
43.7.20.1^answered the crowd, a demon you have;
43.7.20.2^who you seeks to kill?
43.7.21.1^answered jesus and said to them, one work i did, and all you marvel.
43.7.22.1^because of the fact that moses has given you - circumcision   not that of - moses it is, but of the fathers   also on sabbath you circumcise a man.
43.7.23.1^if circumcision receives a man on sabbath so that not might be broken the law of moses, with me are you angry because entirely a man sound i made on the sabbath?
43.7.24.1^not judge according to appearance, but the righteous judgment judge.
43.7.25.1^were saying therefore some of those of jerusalem, not this is he whom they seek to kill?
43.7.26.1^and behold, publicly he speaks, and nothing to him they say not ever.
43.7.26.2^truly have recognized the rulers that this is the christ?
43.7.27.1^but this man, we know from where he is.
43.7.27.2^the however christ, whenever he may come, no one knows from where he is.
43.7.28.1^cried out therefore in the temple teaching - jesus, and saying, me you know, and you know from where i am;
43.7.28.2^and of myself not i have come, but is true the one having sent me, whom you not know.
43.7.29.1^but i know him, because from him i am, and he me sent.
43.7.30.1^they were seeking therefore him to take, but no one laid upon him the hand, because not yet had come the hour of him.
43.7.31.1^out of the crowd now many believed in him and were saying, the christ, when he comes, not more signs will he do than this man has done?
43.7.32.1^heard the pharisees the crowd murmuring about him these things, and sent the chief priests and the pharisees officers, that they might seize him.
43.7.33.1^said therefore - jesus, yet time a little with you i am, and i go to the one having sent me.
43.7.34.1^you will seek me and not will find me;
43.7.34.2^and where am i, you not are able to come.
43.7.35.1^said therefore the jews among themselves, where he is about to go that we not will find him?
43.7.35.2^not to the dispersion among the greeks is he about to go and to teach the greeks?
43.7.36.1^what is the word this that he said, you will seek me, and not will find me, and where am i you not are able to come
43.7.37.1^in now the last day, the great day of the feast, stood - jesus and cried out, saying, if anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink.
43.7.38.1^the one believing in me, as has said the scripture:
43.7.38.2^rivers out of the belly of him will flow of water living.
43.7.39.1^this now he said concerning the spirit, whom were about to receive those having believed in him;
43.7.39.2^not yet given for was the spirit, because jesus not yet was glorified.
43.7.40.1^some of the crowd therefore, having heard the words these, were saying this is truly the prophet.
43.7.41.1^others were saying, this is the christ.
43.7.41.2^others however were saying, not indeed out of - galilee the christ comes?
43.7.42.1^not the scripture has said that out of the seed of david and from bethlehem, the village where was david, comes the christ?
43.7.43.1^a division therefore occurred in the crowd because of him.
43.7.44.1^some now desired of them to seize him, but no one laid on him the hands.
43.7.45.1^came therefore the officers to the chief priests and pharisees, and said to them that, because of why not did you bring him?
43.7.46.1^answered the officers, never spoke like this.
43.7.46.2^a man
43.7.47.1^answered therefore them the pharisees, not also you have been deceived?
43.7.48.1^not any of the rulers has believed on him, or of the pharisees?
43.7.49.1^but the crowd this, - not knowing the law, accursed are.
43.7.50.1^says nicodemus to them, the one having come to him, the former one being of them,
43.7.51.1^not the law of us does judge the man, if not it has heard first from him and known what he does?
43.7.52.1^they answered and said to him, not also you from - galilee are?
43.7.52.2^search and see that out of - galilee a prophet not is raised.
43.7.53.1^and went each to the home of him.
43.8.1.1^jesus however went to the mount - of olives.
43.8.2.1^early in the morning then again he came into the temple, and all the people were coming to him.
43.8.2.2^and having sat down, he was teaching them.
43.8.3.1^bring now the scribes and the pharisees a woman in adultery having been caught, and having set her in the midst,
43.8.4.1^they say to him, teacher, this - woman was caught in the very act, committing adultery.
43.8.5.1^in now the law, us moses commanded - such to be stoned.
43.8.5.2^you therefore, what say you?
43.8.6.1^this now they were saying, testing him so that they might have grounds to accuse him.
43.8.6.2^- but jesus, down having stooped, with his finger began writing on the ground.
43.8.7.1^as however they continued asking him, having lifted himself up also, he said to them, the one sinless among you, the first at her let him cast.
43.8.7.2^stone
43.8.8.1^and again having stooped down, he continued to write on the ground.
43.8.9.1^- and having heard, they began to go away one by one having begun from the elder ones, and he was left alone, and the woman in the midst being.
43.8.10.1^having lifted up then, - jesus said to her, woman, where are they?
43.8.10.2^no one you has condemned?
43.8.11.1^- and she said, no one, sir.
43.8.11.2^said then - jesus, neither i you do condemn;
43.8.11.3^go, and from - now on no more sin.
43.8.12.1^again therefore to them spoke - jesus, saying, i am the light of the world;
43.8.12.2^the one following me no not shall walk in the darkness, but will have the light - of life.
43.8.13.1^said therefore to him the pharisees, you concerning yourself are bearing witness;
43.8.13.2^the testimony of you not is true.
43.8.14.1^answered jesus and said to them, even if i am bearing witness concerning myself, true is the testimony of me, because i know from where i came and where i am going.
43.8.14.2^you however not know from where i come or where i am going.
43.8.15.1^you according to the flesh judge;
43.8.15.2^i not am judging no one.
43.8.16.1^and if judge however i, - judgment - my true is, because alone not i am, but i and the having sent me father.
43.8.17.1^and in the law also - of you it has been written that of two men the testimony true is.
43.8.18.1^i am the one bearing witness concerning myself, and bears witness concerning me the having sent me father.
43.8.19.1^they were saying therefore to him, where is the father of you?
43.8.19.2^answered jesus, neither me you know, nor the father of me.
43.8.19.3^if me you had known, also the father of me - you would have known.
43.8.20.1^these - words he spoke in the treasury, teaching in the temple;
43.8.20.2^and no one seized him, for not yet had come the hour of him.
43.8.21.1^he said then again to them, i am going away and you will seek me, and in the sin of you, you will die;
43.8.21.2^where i go, you not are able to come.
43.8.22.1^were saying therefore the jews, not will he kill himself, that he says, where i go, you not are able to come?
43.8.23.1^and he was saying to them, you from - below are;
43.8.23.2^i from - above am.
43.8.23.3^you of this the world are, i not am of the world this.
43.8.24.1^i said therefore to you that you will die in the sins of you;
43.8.24.2^if for not you believe that i am he, you will die in the sins of you.
43.8.25.1^they were saying therefore to him, you who are?
43.8.25.2^said to them - jesus, from the beginning - what also i am saying to you.
43.8.26.1^many things i have concerning you to say, and to judge;
43.8.26.2^but the one having sent me true is;
43.8.26.3^and i what i have heard from him, these things i say to the world.
43.8.27.1^not they understood that about the father to them he was speaking.
43.8.28.1^said therefore to them - jesus, when you shall have lifted up the son - of man, then you will know that i am he, and from myself i do nothing, but as taught me the father, these things i speak.
43.8.29.1^and the one having sent me, with me is;
43.8.29.2^not he has left me alone, because i the things pleasing to him do always.
43.8.30.1^these things of his speaking, many believed in him.
43.8.31.1^was saying therefore - jesus to the having believed in him jews, if you abide in the word - my, truly disciples of me you are.
43.8.32.1^and you will know the truth, and the truth will set free you.
43.8.33.1^they answered unto him, seed of abraham we are, and to no one have we been under bondage ever.
43.8.33.2^how you say -, free you will become?
43.8.34.1^answered them - jesus, truly, truly, i say to you that everyone - practicing the sin, a slave is of the sin.
43.8.35.1^- now the slave not abides in the house to the age;
43.8.35.2^the son abides to the age.
43.8.36.1^if therefore the son you shall set free, indeed free you will be.
43.8.37.1^i know that seed of abraham you are;
43.8.37.2^but you seek me to kill, because the word - of me not receives a place in you.
43.8.38.1^that which i have seen with the father, i speak;
43.8.38.2^also you therefore what you have heard from the father, you do.
43.8.39.1^they answered and said to him, the father of us abraham is.
43.8.39.2^says to them - jesus, if children - of abraham you were, the works - of abraham you would do;
43.8.40.1^now however you seek me to kill, a man who the truth to you has spoken, that i heard from - god.
43.8.40.2^this abraham not did.
43.8.41.1^you are doing the works of the father of you.
43.8.41.2^they said therefore to him, we of sexual immorality not have been born;
43.8.41.3^one father we have, - god.
43.8.42.1^said to them - jesus, if - god father of you were, you would have loved - me, i for from - god came forth and am here;
43.8.42.2^not even for of myself have i come, but he me sent.
43.8.43.1^because of why the speech - my not do you understand?
43.8.43.2^because not you are able to hear the word - my.
43.8.44.1^you of the father the devil are, and the desires of father of you, you desire to do.
43.8.44.2^he a murderer was from the beginning, and in the truth not has stood, because not there is truth in him.
43.8.44.3^whenever he might speak - falsehood, from the own he speaks;
43.8.44.4^for a liar he is, and the father of it.
43.8.45.1^i now because the truth speak, not you do believe me!
43.8.46.1^which of you convicts me concerning sin?
43.8.46.2^if the truth i speak, because of why you not do believe me?
43.8.47.1^he who is of - god, the words - of god hears;
43.8.47.2^because of this you not hear, because of - god, not you are.
43.8.48.1^answered the jews and said to him, not rightly say we that a samaritan are you, and a demon have?
43.8.49.1^answered jesus, i a demon not have;
43.8.49.2^but i honor the father of me, and you dishonor me.
43.8.50.1^i now not seek the glory of me;
43.8.50.2^there is one seeking it and judging.
43.8.51.1^truly, truly, i say to you, if anyone - my word keeps, death never not shall he see, to the age.
43.8.52.1^said therefore to him the jews, now we know that a demon you have.
43.8.52.2^abraham died, and the prophets, and you say, if anyone the word of me keeps, never not shall he taste of death, to the age.
43.8.53.1^not you greater than are the father of us abraham, who died?
43.8.53.2^and the prophets died!
43.8.53.3^whom yourself make you?
43.8.54.1^answered jesus, if i glorify myself, the glory of me nothing is;
43.8.54.2^it is the father of me - glorifying me, of whom you say -, god of us he is.
43.8.55.1^and not you have known him, i however know him.
43.8.55.2^and if i say that not i know him, i will be like you, a liar.
43.8.55.3^but i know him, and the word of him i keep.
43.8.56.1^abraham the father of you rejoiced in that he should see - day - my, and he saw and rejoiced.
43.8.57.1^said therefore the jews to him, fifty years old not yet are you, and abraham you have seen?
43.8.58.1^said to them jesus, truly, truly, i say to you, before abraham was, i am.
43.8.59.1^they took up therefore stones, that they might cast at him;
43.8.59.2^jesus however hid himself, and went forth out of the temple.
43.9.1.1^and passing by, he saw a man blind from birth.
43.9.2.1^and asked him the disciples of him saying, rabbi, who sinned, this man or the parents of him, that blind he should be born?
43.9.3.1^answered jesus, neither this man sinned, nor the parents of him;
43.9.3.2^but it was that should be displayed the works - of god in him.
43.9.4.1^us it behooves to work the works of the one having sent me, while day it is;
43.9.4.2^is coming night, when no one is able to work.
43.9.5.1^while in the world i shall be, the light i am of the world.
43.9.6.1^these things having said, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and applied to him the clay to the eyes.
43.9.7.1^and he said to him, go, wash in the pool - of siloam, which means sent.
43.9.7.2^he went therefore and washed, and came back seeing.
43.9.8.1^the therefore neighbors and those having seen him - before, that a beggar he was, were saying, not this is he who was sitting and begging?
43.9.9.1^some were saying -, he it is, but others were saying, no, but like him he is.
43.9.9.2^he kept saying -, i am he.
43.9.10.1^they were saying therefore to him, how then were opened of you the eyes?
43.9.11.1^answered he, the man - called jesus clay made, and anointed of me the eyes, and he said to me -, go to - siloam and wash.
43.9.11.2^having gone therefore and having washed, i received sight.
43.9.12.1^and they said to him, where is he?
43.9.12.2^he says, not i know.
43.9.13.1^they bring him to the pharisees who once was blind.
43.9.14.1^was now sabbath in which day the clay had made - jesus and opened of him the eyes.
43.9.15.1^again therefore were asking him also the pharisees how he had received sight.
43.9.15.2^- and he said to them, clay he put of me on the eyes, and i washed, and i see.
43.9.16.1^were saying therefore of the pharisees some, not is this from god the man, for the sabbath not he does keep.
43.9.16.2^others however were saying, how is able a man sinful such signs to do?
43.9.16.3^and division there was among them.
43.9.17.1^they say therefore to the blind man again, what you say concerning him, for he opened of you the eyes?
43.9.17.2^- and he said -, a prophet he is.
43.9.18.1^not did believe then the jews concerning him that he had been blind and had received sight, until when they called the parents of him - having received sight.
43.9.19.1^and they asked them saying, this is the son of you, of whom you say that blind he was born?
43.9.19.2^how then does he see presently?
43.9.20.1^answered therefore the parents of him and said, we know that this is the son of us, and that blind he was born.
43.9.21.1^how however presently he sees, not we know, or who opened of him the eyes, we not know;
43.9.21.2^him ask;
43.9.21.3^age has he.
43.9.21.4^concerning himself, he will speak.
43.9.22.1^these things said the parents of him because they were afraid of the jews;
43.9.22.2^already for had agreed together the jews that if anyone him should confess christ, expelled from the synagogue he would be.
43.9.23.1^because of this, the parents of him said -, age he has;
43.9.23.2^him ask.
43.9.24.1^they called therefore the man out a second time who had been blind, and said to him, give glory - to god!
43.9.24.2^we know that this - man a sinner is.
43.9.25.1^answered then he, whether a sinner he is, not i know.
43.9.25.2^one thing i do know, that blind being, now i see.
43.9.26.1^they said therefore to him, what did he to you?
43.9.26.2^how opened he of you the eyes?
43.9.27.1^he answered them, i told you already, and not you did listen.
43.9.27.2^why again do you wish to hear?
43.9.27.3^not also you do wish his disciples to become?
43.9.28.1^and they railed at him and said, you a disciple are of that one;
43.9.28.2^we however - of moses are disciples.
43.9.29.1^we know that to moses has spoken - god;
43.9.29.2^this man however not we know from where is.
43.9.30.1^answered the man and said to them, in this for - an amazing thing is, that you not know from where he is, and yet he opened my - eyes.
43.9.31.1^we know that sinners - god not does hear;
43.9.31.2^but if anyone god-fearing is, and the will of him does, him he hears.
43.9.32.1^out of the age never it has been heard, that opened anyone the eyes of one blind having been born.
43.9.33.1^if not were this man from god, not he could do nothing.
43.9.34.1^they answered and said to him, in sins you were born entirely, and you teach us?
43.9.34.2^and they cast him out.
43.9.35.1^heard jesus that they had cast him out, and having found him, he said, you believe in the son of man?
43.9.36.1^answered he and said, and who is he, lord, that i may believe in him?
43.9.37.1^said to him - jesus, both you have seen him, and the one speaking with you he is.
43.9.38.1^- and he was saying, i believe, lord.
43.9.38.2^and he worshiped him.
43.9.39.1^and said - jesus, for judgment i into the world this came, that those not seeing may see;
43.9.39.2^and those seeing, blind may become.
43.9.40.1^heard of the pharisees these things, who with him were, and they said to him, not also we blind are?
43.9.41.1^said to them - jesus, if blind you were, not - you would have sin;
43.9.41.2^since however you say -, we see, the sin of you remains.
43.10.1.1^truly, truly, i say to you, the one not entering in by the door to the fold of the sheep, but climbing up another way, he a thief is and a robber.
43.10.2.1^the one however entering in by the door, shepherd is of the sheep.
43.10.3.1^to him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep the voice of him hear, and the own sheep he calls by name and leads out them.
43.10.4.1^when the own all he has brought out, before them he goes, and the sheep him follow, because they know the voice of him.
43.10.5.1^a stranger however in no way not they will follow, but will flee from him, because not they recognize - of strangers the voice.
43.10.6.1^this - allegory spoke to them - jesus;
43.10.6.2^they however not knew what it was that he was saying to them.
43.10.7.1^said therefore again - jesus, truly, truly, i say to you -, i am the door of the sheep.
43.10.8.1^all who ever came before me, thieves are and robbers;
43.10.8.2^but not did hear them the sheep.
43.10.9.1^i am the door;
43.10.9.2^by me if anyone enters in, he will be saved, and he will go in and will go out, and pasture will find.
43.10.10.1^the thief not comes if not that he might steal, and might kill, and might destroy.
43.10.10.2^i came that life they may have, and abundantly may have it.
43.10.11.1^i am the shepherd - good.
43.10.11.2^the shepherd - good, the life of him lays down for the sheep;
43.10.12.1^the hired servant however not being the shepherd, whose not are the sheep own, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees   and the wolf snatches them and scatters
43.10.13.1^because a hired servant he is, and not is himself concerned to him about the sheep.
43.10.14.1^i am the shepherd - good;
43.10.14.2^and i know - my own, and am known i by mine.
43.10.15.1^as knows me the father, i also know the father;
43.10.15.2^and the life of me i lay down for the sheep.
43.10.16.1^and other sheep i have, which not are of the fold this;
43.10.16.2^those also it behooves me to bring, and the voice of me they will hear;
43.10.16.3^and there will be one flock, with one shepherd.
43.10.17.1^because of this, me the father loves, because i lay down the life of me, that again i might take it.
43.10.18.1^no one takes it from me, but i lay down it of myself.
43.10.18.2^authority i have to lay down it, and authority i have again to take it.
43.10.18.3^this - commandment i received from the father of me.
43.10.19.1^division again there was among the jews on account of the words these.
43.10.20.1^were saying now many of them, a demon he has, and is insane;
43.10.20.2^why him do you listen to?
43.10.21.1^others were saying, these - sayings not are those of one possessed by a demon.
43.10.21.2^not a demon is able of the blind the eyes to open?
43.10.22.1^took place at the time the feast of dedication, at - jerusalem.
43.10.22.2^winter it was,
43.10.23.1^and was walking - jesus in the temple in the porch - of solomon.
43.10.24.1^encircled therefore him the jews, and they were saying to him, until when the soul of us hold you in suspense?
43.10.24.2^if you are the christ, tell us plainly.
43.10.25.1^answered them - jesus, i told you, and not you believe.
43.10.25.2^the works that i do in the name of the father of me, these bear witness concerning me.
43.10.26.1^but you not believe, because not you are from among the sheep - of me.
43.10.27.1^the sheep - of me, the voice of me hear, and i know them, and they follow me;
43.10.28.1^and i give them life eternal;
43.10.28.2^and never not shall they perish, to the age, and never will seize anyone them out of the hand of me.
43.10.29.1^the father of me who has given them to me, than all greater is, and no one is able to seize them out of the hand the father.
43.10.30.1^i and the father one are.
43.10.31.1^took up again stones the jews, that they might stone him.
43.10.32.1^answered them - jesus, many works good i have shown you from the father;
43.10.32.2^because of which of these work, me do you stone?
43.10.33.1^answered him the jews, for a good work not we do stone you, but for blasphemy, and because you, a man being, make yourself god.
43.10.34.1^answered them - jesus, not is it written in the law of you -:
43.10.34.2^i said gods you are
43.10.35.1^if them he called gods, to whom the word - of god came, and not is able to be broken the scripture,
43.10.36.1^of him whom the father sanctified and sent into the world, you do say -, you blaspheme, because i said, son - of god i am?
43.10.37.1^if not i do the works of the father of me, not believe me.
43.10.38.1^if however i do, even if me not you believe, the works believe, so that you may know and may understand that in me is the father, and i in the father.
43.10.39.1^they were seeking therefore him again to seize, but he went forth out of the hand of them.
43.10.40.1^and he departed again beyond the jordan, to the place where was john - at first baptizing.
43.10.40.2^and he stayed there.
43.10.41.1^and many came to him and were saying -, john indeed sign did no;
43.10.41.2^everything however that said john about this man, true was.
43.10.42.1^and many believed in him there.
43.11.1.1^was now a certain man ailing, lazarus of bethany, of the village of mary and martha, the sister of her.
43.11.2.1^was now mary the one having anointed the lord with fragrant oil and having wiped the feet of him with the hair of her, whose - brother lazarus was sick.
43.11.3.1^sent therefore the sisters to him, saying, lord, behold, he whom you love is sick.
43.11.4.1^having heard then, - jesus said, this - sickness not is unto death, but for the glory - of god, that may be glorified the son - of god by it.
43.11.5.1^loved now - jesus - martha, and the sister of her, and - lazarus.
43.11.6.1^when therefore he heard that he is sick, then indeed he remained in which he was the place two days.
43.11.7.1^then after this he says to the disciples, let us go into - judea again.
43.11.8.1^say to him the disciples, rabbi, just now were seeking you to stone the jews, and again you are going there?
43.11.9.1^answered jesus, not twelve hours are there in the day?
43.11.9.2^if anyone walks in the day, not he stumbles, because the light the world of this he sees;
43.11.10.1^if however anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light not is in him.
43.11.11.1^these things he said, and after this he says to them, lazarus the friend of us has fallen asleep, but i go that i may awaken him.
43.11.12.1^said therefore the disciples of him, lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will get well.
43.11.13.1^had spoken however - jesus of the death of him;
43.11.13.2^they however thought that of the rest - of sleep he speaks.
43.11.14.1^then therefore said to them - jesus plainly, lazarus has died.
43.11.15.1^and i rejoice for sake of you, in order that you might believe, that not i was there.
43.11.15.2^but let us go to him.
43.11.16.1^said therefore thomas, - called didymus, to the fellow disciples, let go also us, that we may die with him.
43.11.17.1^having come therefore, - jesus found him, four already days having been in the tomb.
43.11.18.1^was now - bethany near - jerusalem, about away stadia fifteen.
43.11.19.1^many now of the jews had come unto - martha and mary that they might console them concerning the brother.
43.11.20.1^- therefore martha, when she heard that jesus is coming, met him;
43.11.20.2^mary however in the house was sitting.
43.11.21.1^said then - martha to - jesus, lord, if you had been here, not - would have died the brother of me.
43.11.22.1^nevertheless even now i know that whatever - you might ask - god, will give you - god.
43.11.23.1^says to her - jesus, will rise again the brother of you.
43.11.24.1^says to him - martha, i know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day.
43.11.25.1^said to her - jesus, i am the resurrection and the life;
43.11.25.2^the one believing in me, even if he should die, he will live;
43.11.26.1^and everyone - living and believing in me, never not shall die, to the age.
43.11.26.2^believe you this?
43.11.27.1^she says to him, yes, lord;
43.11.27.2^i have believed that you are the christ, the son - of god, the one into the world coming.
43.11.28.1^and these things having said, she went away and called mary, the sister of her, secretly, having said, the teacher is come, and he calls you.
43.11.29.1^she then when she heard, rose up quickly and was coming to him.
43.11.30.1^not yet now had come - jesus into the village, but was still in the place where had met him - martha.
43.11.31.1^the then jews - being with her in the house and consoling her, having seen - mary that quickly she rose up and went out, followed her, having supposed - she is going to the tomb that she might weep there.
43.11.32.1^- therefore mary, when she came to where was jesus, having seen him, fell of him at the feet, saying to him, lord, if you had been here, not - of me would have died the brother.
43.11.33.1^jesus therefore when he saw her weeping, and the having come with her jews weeping, he was deeply moved - in spirit and troubled himself.
43.11.34.1^and he said, where have you laid him.
43.11.34.2^they say to him, lord, come and see.
43.11.35.1^wept - jesus.
43.11.36.1^were saying therefore the jews, behold how he loved him!
43.11.37.1^some however of them said, not was able this man - having opened the eyes of the blind, to have caused that also this one not should have died?
43.11.38.1^jesus therefore again, being deeply moved in himself, comes to the tomb.
43.11.38.2^it was now a cave, and a stone was lying against it.
43.11.39.1^says - jesus, take away the stone.
43.11.39.2^says to him the sister of the one having died, martha, lord, already he stinks, four days for it is.
43.11.40.1^says to her - jesus, not said i to you that if you should believe, you will see the glory - of god?
43.11.41.1^they took away therefore the stone.
43.11.41.2^- now jesus lifted his eyes upwards and said, father, i thank you that you have heard me.
43.11.42.1^i and knew that always me you hear;
43.11.42.2^but on account of the crowd - standing around i said it, that they may believe that you me sent.
43.11.43.1^and these things having said, in a voice loud he cried out, lazarus, come forth.
43.11.44.1^came forth the one having been dead, being bound the feet and the hands with linen strips, and the face of him in a headcloth bound about.
43.11.44.2^says to them - jesus, unbind him and allow him to go.
43.11.45.1^many therefore of the jews - having come to - mary and having seen what he did, believed in him;
43.11.46.1^some however of them went to the pharisees and told them what had done jesus.
43.11.47.1^gathered therefore the chief priests and the pharisees a council, and they were saying, what are we to do?
43.11.47.2^for this - man many does signs.
43.11.48.1^if we shall let him alone him like this, all will believe in him, and will come the romans and will take away of us both the place and the nation.
43.11.49.1^one however certain of them, caiaphas, high priest being the year same, said to them, you not know nothing,
43.11.50.1^nor consider you that it is profitable for you that one man should die for the people, and not all the nation should perish.
43.11.51.1^this now from himself not he said, but high priest being the year that, he prophesied that was about jesus to die for the nation,
43.11.52.1^and not for the nation only, but that also the children - of god, those having been scattered, he might gather together into one.
43.11.53.1^from that therefore - day they took counsel together that they might kill him.
43.11.54.1^- therefore jesus no longer publicly walked among the jews, but went away from there into the region near the wilderness, to ephraim called a city.
43.11.54.2^and there he stayed with the disciples.
43.11.55.1^was now near the passover of the jews, and went up many to jerusalem out of the region before the passover, so that they might purify themselves.
43.11.56.1^they were seeking therefore - jesus and were saying among one another in the temple standing, what does it seem to you, that no not he will come to the feast?
43.11.57.1^had given now the chief priests and the pharisees a command that if anyone should know where he is, he should show it, so that they might seize him.
43.12.1.1^- therefore jesus, before six days the passover, came to bethany, where was lazarus, whom had raised out from the dead jesus.
43.12.2.1^they made therefore him a supper there, and - martha was serving, - and lazarus one was of those reclining with him.
43.12.3.1^- therefore mary, having taken a litra of fragrant oil of nard pure of great price, anointed the feet - of jesus and wiped with the hair of her the feet of him;
43.12.3.2^the now house was filled with the fragrance of the oil.
43.12.4.1^says however judas - iscariot, one of the disciples of him, - being about him to betray,
43.12.5.1^because of why this - fragrant oil not was sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?
43.12.6.1^he said however this, not because for the poor he was caring to him, but because a thief he was, and the money bag having, that being put into it he used to pilfer.
43.12.7.1^said therefore - jesus, leave alone her, so that for the day of the burial of me she may keep it;
43.12.8.1^the poor for always you have with you;
43.12.8.2^me however not always you have.
43.12.9.1^knew therefore - a crowd great of the jews that there he is;
43.12.9.2^and they came, not because of - jesus only, but that also - lazarus they might see, whom he had raised out from the dead.
43.12.10.1^took counsel however the chief priests that also - lazarus they might kill,
43.12.11.1^because many on account of him were going away of the jews and were believing in - jesus.
43.12.12.1^on the next day the crowd great - having come to the feast, having heard that is coming - jesus into jerusalem,
43.12.13.1^took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet him, and were shouting:
43.12.13.2^hosanna!
43.12.13.3^blessed is the one coming in the name of the lord!
43.12.13.4^and the king - of israel!
43.12.14.1^having found then - jesus a young donkey, he sat upon it, as it is written:
43.12.15.1^not fear, daughter of zion.
43.12.15.2^behold, the king of you comes, sitting on a colt of a donkey.
43.12.16.1^these things not knew of him the disciples from the first, but when was glorified jesus, then they remembered that these things were of him written, and these things they had done to him.
43.12.17.1^continued to bear witness therefore the crowd - being with him when - lazarus he called out of the tomb and raised him out from the dead.
43.12.18.1^on account of this also met him the crowd, because they heard this of his having done the sign.
43.12.19.1^- therefore the pharisees said among themselves, you see that not you gain nothing.
43.12.19.2^behold, the world after him has gone.
43.12.20.1^there were now greeks certain among those coming up that they might worship at the feast;
43.12.21.1^these therefore came to philip, who was from bethsaida - of galilee, and they were asking him saying, sir, we desire - jesus to see.
43.12.22.1^comes - philip and tells - andrew;
43.12.22.2^come andrew and philip and tell - jesus.
43.12.23.1^- and jesus answered them saying, has come the hour that should be glorified the son - of man.
43.12.24.1^truly, truly, i say to you, if not the grain - of wheat, having fallen into the ground, should die, it alone abides;
43.12.24.2^if however it should die, much fruit it bears.
43.12.25.1^the one loving the life of him, loses it, and the one hating the life of him in the world this, to life eternal will keep it.
43.12.26.1^if me anyone serves, me let him follow;
43.12.26.2^and where am i, there also the servant - of me will be.
43.12.26.3^if anyone me serves, will honor him the father.
43.12.27.1^now the soul of me has been troubled, and what shall i say?
43.12.27.2^father, save me from the hour this.
43.12.27.3^but on account of this i came to the hour this.
43.12.28.1^father, glorify of you the name.
43.12.28.2^came therefore a voice from - heaven:
43.12.28.3^both i have glorified it, and again i will glorify it.
43.12.29.1^- therefore the crowd - having stood and having heard was saying, thunder there has been.
43.12.29.2^others were saying, an angel to him has spoken.
43.12.30.1^answered jesus and said not because of me the voice this has come, but because of you.
43.12.31.1^now the judgment is the world of this;
43.12.31.2^now the prince of the world this will be cast out.
43.12.32.1^and i, if i am lifted up from the earth, all will draw to myself.
43.12.33.1^this now he was saying, signifying by what death he was about to die.
43.12.34.1^answered then him the crowd, we have heard from the law that the christ abides to the age, and how say you that it behooves to be lifted up the son - of man?
43.12.34.2^who is this - son - of man?
43.12.35.1^said therefore to them - jesus, yet a little while the light with you is.
43.12.35.2^walk while the light you have, so that not darkness you might overtake.
43.12.35.3^and the one walking in the darkness not knows where he is going.
43.12.36.1^while the light you have, believe in the light, so that sons of light you may become.
43.12.36.2^these things spoke jesus, and having gone away, he was hidden from them.
43.12.37.1^so many however of him signs having been done before them, not they believed in him,
43.12.38.1^so that the word of isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled that said:
43.12.38.2^lord, who has believed the report of us?
43.12.38.3^and the arm of the lord to whom has been revealed?
43.12.39.1^because of this, not they were able to believe, for again said isaiah:
43.12.40.1^he has blinded of them the eyes, and has hardened of them the heart, that not they should see with the eyes, and understand with the heart, and turn, and i will heal them.
43.12.41.1^these things said isaiah because he saw the glory of him and spoke concerning him.
43.12.42.1^nevertheless, indeed even of the rulers many believed in him;
43.12.42.2^but on account of the pharisees not they were confessing, so that not put out of the synagogue they might be;
43.12.43.1^they loved for the glory - of men more than the glory - of god.
43.12.44.1^jesus then cried out and said, the one believing in me, not believes in me, but in the one having sent me;
43.12.45.1^and the one beholding me, beholds the one having sent me.
43.12.46.1^i a light into the world have come, so that everyone - believing in me, in the darkness not should abide.
43.12.47.1^and if anyone of me hears the words and not keeps them, i not do judge him, not for i came that i might judge the world, but that i might save the world.
43.12.48.1^the one rejecting me and not receiving the words of me has one judging him:
43.12.48.2^the word which i spoke, that will judge him in the last day.
43.12.49.1^for i from myself not spoke, but the having sent me father himself, me a commandment gave what i should say and what i should speak.
43.12.50.1^and i know that the commandment of him life eternal is.
43.12.50.2^what therefore i speak, as has said to me the father, so i speak.
43.13.1.1^before now the feast of the passover, knowing - jesus that had come his - hour, that he would depart out of the world this to the father, having loved the own who were in the world, to the end he loved them.
43.13.2.1^and supper taking place, the devil already having put into the heart that he should betray him of judas, son of simon iscariot,
43.13.3.1^knowing that all things has given him the father into the hands, and that from god he came forth and to - god he is going,
43.13.4.1^he rises from the supper and lays aside the garments.
43.13.4.2^and having taken a towel, he girded himself.
43.13.5.1^after that, he pours water into the basin, and he began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.
43.13.6.1^he comes then to simon peter, who says to him, lord, you of me do wash the feet?
43.13.7.1^answered jesus and said to him, what i do you not know presently;
43.13.7.2^you will know however after these things.
43.13.8.1^says to him peter, no not shall you wash of me the feet to the age.
43.13.8.2^answered jesus him, if not i wash you, not you have part with me.
43.13.9.1^says to him simon peter, lord, not the feet of me only, but also the hands and the head.
43.13.10.1^says to him - jesus, the one having been bathed not has need, if not the feet to wash, but is clean wholly;
43.13.10.2^and you all clean are, but not all.
43.13.11.1^he knew for the one who was betraying him;
43.13.11.2^on account of this he said -, not all clean you are.
43.13.12.1^when therefore he had washed the feet of them and taken the garments of him, and having reclined again, he said to them, do you know what i have done to you?
43.13.13.1^you call me - teacher and - lord, and rightly you say, i am for.
43.13.14.1^if therefore i have washed your - feet, the lord and the teacher, also you ought of one another to wash the feet.
43.13.15.1^a pattern for i gave you, that as i did to you, also you should do.
43.13.16.1^truly, truly, i say to you, not is a servant greater than the master of him, nor a messenger greater than the one having sent him.
43.13.17.1^if these things you know, blessed are you if you do them.
43.13.18.1^not about all of you i speak.
43.13.18.2^i know whom i chose, but that the scripture may be fulfilled:
43.13.18.3^the one eating of me the bread lifted up against me the heel of him.
43.13.19.1^from this time i am telling you before - it comes to pass, so that you should believe when it comes to pass, that i am he.
43.13.20.1^truly, truly, i say to you, the one receiving - any i shall send, me receives;
43.13.20.2^the one now me receiving, receives the one having sent me.
43.13.21.1^these things having said, - jesus was troubled - in spirit, and he testified and said, truly, truly, i say to you that one of you will betray me.
43.13.22.1^began to look upon one another the disciples, being uncertain of whom he is speaking.
43.13.23.1^there was reclining one of the disciples of him in the bosom - of jesus, whom loved - jesus.
43.13.24.1^motions therefore to him simon peter to ask who it is about whom he is speaking?
43.13.25.1^having leaned then he thus on the breast - of jesus, he says to him, lord, who is it?
43.13.26.1^answers - jesus, he it is to whom i will dip the morsel and will give him.
43.13.26.2^having dipped then the morsel, he takes it and gives it to judas, son of simon iscariot.
43.13.27.1^and after the morsel, then entered into him - satan.
43.13.27.2^says therefore to him - jesus, what you do, do quickly.
43.13.28.1^this now no one knew of those reclining to what he spoke to him.
43.13.29.1^some for were thinking, since the money bag had judas, that is saying to him - jesus, buy what things need of we have for the feast, or to the poor that something he should give.
43.13.30.1^having received therefore the morsel, he went out immediately;
43.13.30.2^it was now night.
43.13.31.1^when therefore he had gone out, says jesus, now has been glorified the son - of man, and - god has been glorified in him.
43.13.32.1^if - god is glorified in him, also - god will glorify him in himself, and immediately will glorify him.
43.13.33.1^little children, yet a little while with you i am.
43.13.33.2^you will seek me;
43.13.33.3^and, as i said to the jews -:
43.13.33.4^where i go, you not are able to come, also to you i say now.
43.13.34.1^a commandment new i give to you, that you should love one another;
43.13.34.2^as i have loved you, so also you should love one another.
43.13.35.1^by this will know all that to me disciples you are, if love you have among one another.
43.13.36.1^says to him simon peter, lord, where go you?
43.13.36.2^answered him jesus, where i go, not you are able me now to follow;
43.13.36.3^you will follow however afterward.
43.13.37.1^says to him - peter, lord, because of why not am i able you to follow presently?
43.13.37.2^the life of me for you i will lay down.
43.13.38.1^answered jesus, the life of you for me will you lay down?
43.13.38.2^truly, truly, i say to you, no not the rooster will crow, until that you will deny me three times.
43.14.1.1^not let be troubled of you the heart.
43.14.1.2^you believe in - god, also in me believe.
43.14.2.1^in the house of the father of me, mansions many there are;
43.14.2.2^if now not, would i have told - you that i go to prepare a place for you?
43.14.3.1^and if i go and prepare a place for you, again i am coming and will receive you to myself, that where am i, also you may be.
43.14.4.1^and to the place i am going, you know the way.
43.14.5.1^says to him thomas, lord, not we know where you are going;
43.14.5.2^how can we the way know?
43.14.6.1^says to him - jesus, i am the way, and the truth, and the life.
43.14.6.2^no one comes to the father, if not by me.
43.14.7.1^if you had known me, also the father of me you would have known;
43.14.7.2^- from now you know him and have seen him.
43.14.8.1^says to him philip, lord, show us the father, and it is enough for us.
43.14.9.1^says to him - jesus, so long a time with you am i, and not you have known me, philip?
43.14.9.2^the one having seen me has seen the father;
43.14.9.3^how you say, show us the father?
43.14.10.1^not believe you that i am in the father, and the father in me is?
43.14.10.2^the words that i speak to you, from myself not i speak, - but the father in me dwelling does the works of him.
43.14.11.1^believe me that i am in the father, and the father in me;
43.14.11.2^if but not, because of the works themselves believe.
43.14.12.1^truly, truly, i say to you, the one believing in me, the works that i do, also he will do, and greater than these he will do, because i to the father am going.
43.14.13.1^and - whatever - you might ask in the name of me, this will i do, so that may be glorified the father in the son.
43.14.14.1^if anything you ask me in the name of me, i will do it.
43.14.15.1^if you love me, - commandments - my you will keep.
43.14.16.1^and i will ask the father, and another helper he will give you, that with you to the age, he may be
43.14.17.1^the spirit - of truth, whom the world not is able to receive, because not it does see him, nor know.
43.14.17.2^but you know him, for with you he abides, and in you he will be.
43.14.18.1^not i will leave you as orphans;
43.14.18.2^i am coming to you.
43.14.19.1^yet a little while and the world me no more sees, you however see me;
43.14.19.2^because i live, also you will live.
43.14.20.1^in that - day will know you that i am in the father of me, and you in me, and i in you.
43.14.21.1^the one having the commandments of me and keeping them, he is the one loving me;
43.14.21.2^the one now loving me, will be loved by the father of me;
43.14.21.3^and i will love him and will show to him myself.
43.14.22.1^says to him judas, not - iscariot, lord, then what has occurred that to us you are about to manifest yourself, and not to the world?
43.14.23.1^answered jesus and said to him, if anyone loves me, the word of me he will keep, and the father of me will love him, and to him we will come, and a home with him will make.
43.14.24.1^the one not loving me, the words of me not does keep;
43.14.24.2^and the word that you hear, not is mine, but of the having sent me father.
43.14.25.1^these things i have said to you, with you abiding.
43.14.26.1^the however helper, the spirit - holy, whom will send the father in the name of me, he you will teach all things and will bring to remembrance of you all things that have said to you i.
43.14.27.1^peace i leave with you;
43.14.27.2^peace - my i give to you;
43.14.27.3^not as the world gives, i give to you.
43.14.27.4^not let be troubled of you the heart, nor let it fear.
43.14.28.1^you heard that i said to you, i am going away and i am coming to you.
43.14.28.2^if you loved me, you would have rejoiced - that i am going to the father, because the father greater than i is.
43.14.29.1^and now i have told you before it comes to pass, that when it shall have come to pass, you might believe.
43.14.30.1^no longer much i will speak with you;
43.14.30.2^comes for the of this world ruler, and in me not he has nothing;
43.14.31.1^but that may know the world that i love the father, and as has commanded me the father, thus i do.
43.14.31.2^rise up, let us go from here.
43.15.1.1^i am the vine - true, and the father of me, the vinedresser is.
43.15.2.1^every branch in me not bearing fruit, he takes away it;
43.15.2.2^and every one - fruit bearing, he prunes it, that fruit more it may bear.
43.15.3.1^already you clean are by reason of the word that i have spoken to you.
43.15.4.1^abide in me, and i in you.
43.15.4.2^as the branch not is able fruit to bear of itself, if not it abide in the vine, so neither can you, if not in me you abide.
43.15.5.1^i am the vine;
43.15.5.2^you are the branches.
43.15.5.3^the one abiding in me, and i in him, he bears fruit much.
43.15.5.4^for apart from me not you are able to do nothing.
43.15.6.1^if not anyone abide in me, he is thrown out like the branch and is dried up, and they gather them and into the fire cast, and it is burned.
43.15.7.1^if you abide in me and the words of me in you abide, whatever if you wish, you shall ask, and it will come to pass to you.
43.15.8.1^in this is glorified the father of me, that fruit much you should bear, and you shall be to me disciples.
43.15.9.1^as has loved me the father, i also you have loved.
43.15.9.2^abide in the love - of me.
43.15.10.1^if the commandments of me you keep, you will abide in the love of me, as i, the commandments the father of me have kept, and i abide of him in the love.
43.15.11.1^these things i have spoken to you, that - joy - my in you may be, and the joy of you may be full.
43.15.12.1^this is - commandment - my, that you love one another as i loved you.
43.15.13.1^greater than this love no one has, that one the life of him should lay down for the friends of him.
43.15.14.1^you friends of me are if you do what i command you.
43.15.15.1^no longer i call you servants, for the servant not knows what is doing his - master.
43.15.15.2^you however i have called friends, because all things that i heard from the father of me, i have made known to you.
43.15.16.1^not you me chose, but i chose you, and appointed you that you should go and fruit you should bear, and the fruit of you should remain;
43.15.16.2^so that - whatever - you might ask the father in the name of me, he may give you.
43.15.17.1^these things i command you, that you love one another.
43.15.18.1^if the world you hates, you know that me before you it has hated.
43.15.19.1^if of the world you were, the world - as its own would love you;
43.15.19.2^because however of the world not you are, but i chose you out of the world, on account of this hates you the world.
43.15.20.1^remember the word that i said to you:
43.15.20.2^not is a servant greater than the master of him.
43.15.20.3^if me they persecuted, also you they will persecute;
43.15.20.4^if the word of me they kept, also - yours they will keep.
43.15.21.1^but these things all they will do against you on account of the name of me, because not they have known the one having sent me.
43.15.22.1^if not i had come and spoken to them, sin not they would have had;
43.15.22.2^now however excuse not they have for the sin of them.
43.15.23.1^the one me hating, also the father of me hates.
43.15.24.1^if the works not i had done among them that no other has done, sin not they would have had;
43.15.24.2^now however both they have seen and have hated both me and the father of me.
43.15.25.1^but this is that may be fulfilled the word - in the law of them having been written -:
43.15.25.2^they hated me without cause.
43.15.26.1^when comes the helper, whom i will send to you from the father, the spirit - of truth, who from the father goes forth, he will bear witness concerning me.
43.15.27.1^also you now bear witness, because from the beginning with me you are.
43.16.1.1^these things i have spoken to you that not you might fall away.
43.16.2.1^out of the synagogues they will put you;
43.16.2.2^but is coming an hour that everyone - having killed you will think it is a service to offer - to god.
43.16.3.1^and these things they will do, because not they know the father, nor me.
43.16.4.1^but these things i have said to you, so that when might have come the hour of them, you may remember them, that i said them to you.
43.16.4.2^these things now to you from the beginning not i said, because with you i was.
43.16.5.1^now however i go to the one having sent me, and none of you asks me, where are you going?
43.16.6.1^but because these things i have said to you, - sorrow has filled your - heart.
43.16.7.1^but i the truth say to you, it is profitable for you that i should go away.
43.16.7.2^if for not i go away, the helper no will come to you;
43.16.7.3^if however i go, i will send him to you.
43.16.8.1^and having come, he will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment:
43.16.9.1^concerning sin indeed, because not do they believe in me;
43.16.10.1^concerning righteousness now, because to the father i go away, and no more you behold me;
43.16.11.1^concerning now judgment, because the ruler of the world this has been judged.
43.16.12.1^yet many things i have to you to say, but not you are able to bear them now.
43.16.13.1^when however shall come he, the spirit - of truth, he will guide you into the truth all;
43.16.13.2^not for he will speak from himself, but whatever he may hear, he will speak;
43.16.13.3^and the things coming he will declare to you.
43.16.14.1^he me will glorify, for from that which is mine he will take, and will disclose to you.
43.16.15.1^all things whatever has the father, mine are;
43.16.15.2^because of this, i said that from that which is mine he will take and will disclose to you.
43.16.16.1^a little while and no longer you do behold me;
43.16.16.2^and again a little while and you will see me.
43.16.17.1^said therefore some of the disciples of him to one another, what is this that he says to us, a little while and not you do behold me;
43.16.17.2^and, again a little while and you will see me  and because i am going to the father?
43.16.18.1^they were saying therefore, what is this that he says, a little while?
43.16.18.2^not we do know what he is saying.
43.16.19.1^knew - jesus that they were desiring him to ask, and he said to them, concerning this do you inquire among one another that i said, a little while and not you do behold me, and again a little while and you will see me?
43.16.20.1^truly, truly, i say to you that will weep and will lament you, - but the world will rejoice.
43.16.20.2^you will be grieved, but the grief of you to joy will turn.
43.16.21.1^the woman when she is giving birth, pain has, because has come the hour of her;
43.16.21.2^when however she brings forth the child, no longer she remembers the tribulation, on account of the joy that has been born a man into the world.
43.16.22.1^also you therefore, now indeed grief have;
43.16.22.2^again however i will see you, and will rejoice your - heart, and the joy of you no one will take from you.
43.16.23.1^and in that - day, of me not you will ask nothing.
43.16.23.2^truly, truly, i say to you, - whatever you may ask, the father in the name of me.
43.16.23.3^he will give you,
43.16.24.1^until now not you have asked nothing in the name of me.
43.16.24.2^ask and you will receive, that the joy of you may be full.
43.16.25.1^these things in allegories i have spoken to you;
43.16.25.2^is coming an hour when no more in allegories i will speak to you, but plainly concerning the father i will report to you.
43.16.26.1^in that - day in the name of me you will ask, and not i say to you that i will implore the father for you.
43.16.27.1^himself for the father loves you, because you me have loved and have believed that i from - god came forth.
43.16.28.1^i came forth from the father and have come into the world;
43.16.28.2^again i leave the world and go to the father.
43.16.29.1^say the disciples of him, behold, now in openness you speak, and allegory not speak.
43.16.30.1^now we know that you know all things, and not need have that anyone you should ask.
43.16.30.2^in this we believe that from god you came forth.
43.16.31.1^answered them jesus, now do you believe?
43.16.32.1^behold, is coming an hour, and has come, when you will be scattered, each to the own, and i alone you shall leave;
43.16.32.2^yet not i am alone, for the father with me is.
43.16.33.1^these things i have spoken to you so that in me peace you may have.
43.16.33.2^in the world tribulation you have.
43.16.33.3^but take courage;
43.16.33.4^i have overcome the world.
43.17.1.1^these things spoke jesus, and having lifted up the eyes of him to - heaven, he said, father, has come the hour;
43.17.1.2^glorify your - son, that the son may glorify you.
43.17.2.1^as you gave him authority over all flesh, so that all whom you have given him, he may give to them life eternal.
43.17.3.1^this now is - eternal life, that they may know you, the only true god, and whom you have sent, jesus christ.
43.17.4.1^i you glorified on the earth, the work having completed that you have given me that i should do.
43.17.5.1^and now glorify me you, father, with yourself, with the glory that i had before - the world existed, with you.
43.17.6.1^i revealed your - name to the men whom you have given me out of the world.
43.17.6.2^yours they were, and to me them you gave, and the word of you they have kept.
43.17.7.1^now they have known that all things whatever you have given me, of you are;
43.17.8.1^for the words that you have given me, i have given them, and they received them and knew truly that from you i came forth;
43.17.8.2^and they believed that you me sent.
43.17.9.1^i concerning them am praying.
43.17.9.2^not concerning the world do i pray, but concerning those whom you have given me, for yours they are.
43.17.10.1^and things of mine all, yours are;
43.17.10.2^and - yours, mine;
43.17.10.3^and i have been glorified in them.
43.17.11.1^and no longer i am in the world, and yet themselves in the world they are, and i to you am coming.
43.17.11.2^father holy, keep them in the name of you, which you have given me, that they may be one as we are.
43.17.12.1^when i was with them, i was keeping them in the name of you, which you have given me.
43.17.12.2^and i guarded them, and none of them has perished, if not the son - of destruction, that the scripture might be fulfilled.
43.17.13.1^now however to you i am coming;
43.17.13.2^and these things i speak in the world, so that they may have - joy - my fulfilled within them.
43.17.14.1^i have given them the word of you, and the world hated them, because not they are of the world, even as i not am of the world.
43.17.15.1^not i do ask that you should take them out of the world, but that you should keep them from - evil.
43.17.16.1^of the world not they are, as i not am of the world.
43.17.17.1^sanctify them by the truth;
43.17.17.2^the word - of you truth is.
43.17.18.1^as me you sent into the world, i also sent them into the world;
43.17.19.1^and for them i sanctify myself, that may be also they sanctified in truth.
43.17.20.1^not for these however do i ask only, but also for those believing through the word of them in me,
43.17.21.1^that all one may be, as you, father, are in me, and i in you, that also they in us may be, that the world may believe that you me sent.
43.17.22.1^and i the glory which you have given me, have given them, so that they may be one, as we are one
43.17.23.1^i in them, and you in me   that they may be perfected in unity, so that may know the world that you me sent and loved them even as me you loved.
43.17.24.1^father, those whom you have given me, i desire that where am i, they also may be with me, that they may behold - glory - my, that you gave me because you loved me before the foundation of the world.
43.17.25.1^father righteous, although the world you not has known, i now you have known, and these have known that you me sent.
43.17.26.1^and i made known to them the name of you, and will make it known, so that the love with which you loved me in them may be, and i in them.
43.18.1.1^these things having said, jesus went out with the disciples of him beyond the winter stream - of kidron, where there was a garden, into which entered he and the disciples of him.
43.18.2.1^knew now also judas, who was delivering up him, the place, because often gathered together jesus there with the disciples of him.
43.18.3.1^- therefore judas, having procured the cohort and from the chief priests and from the pharisees officers, comes there with lanterns, and torches, and weapons.
43.18.4.1^jesus therefore, knowing all things that are coming upon him, having gone forth also said to them, whom seek you?
43.18.5.1^they answered him, jesus of nazareth.
43.18.5.2^he says to them, i am he.
43.18.5.3^had been standing now also judas, who is delivering up him, with them.
43.18.6.1^when therefore he said to them, i am he, they drew toward the back and fell to the ground.
43.18.7.1^again therefore he questioned them, whom seek you?
43.18.7.2^- and they said, jesus of nazareth.
43.18.8.1^answered jesus, i have told you that i am he.
43.18.8.2^if therefore me you seek, allow these to go away,
43.18.9.1^so that might be fulfilled the word that he had spoken -, those whom you have given me, not i lost of them not one.
43.18.10.1^simon then peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the of the high priest servant, and cut off of him the ear - right.
43.18.10.2^was now name of the servant malchus.
43.18.11.1^said therefore - jesus - to peter, put the sword into the sheath.
43.18.11.2^the cup which has given me the father, no not shall i drink it?
43.18.12.1^- then the cohort and the commander and the officers of the jews took hold of - jesus and bound him,
43.18.13.1^and they led him away to annas first;
43.18.13.2^he was for father-in-law - of caiaphas, who was high priest the year same.
43.18.14.1^was now caiaphas the one having given counsel to the jews that it is profitable for one man to perish for the people.
43.18.15.1^were following now - jesus simon peter and the other disciple.
43.18.15.2^since now disciple that was known to the high priest, also he entered with - jesus into the court of the high priest.
43.18.16.1^- but peter stood at the door outside.
43.18.16.2^went out therefore the disciple - other, who was known to the high priest, and spoke to the doorkeeper, and brought in - peter.
43.18.17.1^says therefore - to peter the servant girl, the doorkeeper, not also you of the disciples are of the man this?
43.18.17.2^says he, not i am.
43.18.18.1^were standing now the servants and the officers, a fire of coals having made, for cold it was and they were warming themselves.
43.18.18.2^was now also - peter with them standing and warming himself.
43.18.19.1^- then the high priest questioned - jesus concerning the disciples of him and concerning the teaching of him.
43.18.20.1^answered him jesus, i openly have spoken to the world;
43.18.20.2^i always taught in the synagogue and in the temple, where all the jews come together, and in secret i spoke nothing.
43.18.21.1^why me do you question?
43.18.21.2^question those having heard what i spoke to them;
43.18.21.3^behold, they know what said i.
43.18.22.1^these things now of him having said, one standing by of the officers gave a blow with the palm - to jesus, having said, thus answer you the high priest?
43.18.23.1^answered him jesus, if evil i spoke, bear witness concerning the evil;
43.18.23.2^if however rightly, why me strike you?
43.18.24.1^sent then him - annas, bound, to caiaphas the high priest.
43.18.25.1^was now simon peter standing and warming himself.
43.18.25.2^they said therefore to him, not also you of the disciples of him are?
43.18.25.3^denied he and said, not i am.
43.18.26.1^says one of the servants of the high priest, kinsman being of him of whom had cut off peter the ear, not i you saw in the garden with him?
43.18.27.1^again then denied peter, and immediately a rooster crowed.
43.18.28.1^they are leading then - jesus from - caiaphas into the praetorium.
43.18.28.2^it was now early, and they not entered into the praetorium so that not they should be defiled, but might eat the passover.
43.18.29.1^went therefore - pilate out to them and said, what accusation bring you against the man this?
43.18.30.1^they answered and said to him, if not were he evil doing, not - to you we would have delivered him.
43.18.31.1^said therefore to them - pilate, take him yourselves and according to the law of you judge him.
43.18.31.2^said to him the jews, to us not it is permitted to put to death no one
43.18.32.1^that the word - of jesus might be fulfilled, which he had spoken, signifying what death he was about to die.
43.18.33.1^entered therefore again into the praetorium - pilate, and he called - jesus and said to him, you are the king of the jews?
43.18.34.1^answered jesus, of yourself you this say, or others did say it to you concerning me?
43.18.35.1^answered - pilate, not i a jew am?
43.18.35.2^the nation - of you and the chief priests delivered you to me.
43.18.35.3^what have you done?
43.18.36.1^answered jesus, the kingdom - my not is of the world this;
43.18.36.2^if of the world this were - kingdom - my, - attendants - my would fight - that not i might be betrayed to the jews.
43.18.36.3^now however - kingdom - my not is from here.
43.18.37.1^said therefore to him - pilate, then a king are you?
43.18.37.2^answered - jesus, you say that a king i am.
43.18.37.3^i for this have been born, and for this i have come into the world, that i may bear witness to the truth.
43.18.37.4^everyone - being of the truth hears of me the voice.
43.18.38.1^says to him - pilate, what is truth?
43.18.38.2^and this having said, again he went out to the jews and says to them, i no find in him guilt.
43.18.39.1^it is however a custom with you that one i should release to you at the passover;
43.18.39.2^wish you therefore i should release to you the king of the jews?
43.18.40.1^they cried out then again saying, not this one, but - barabbas!
43.18.40.2^was now - barabbas an insurrectionist.
43.19.1.1^at that time therefore took - pilate - jesus and flogged him.
43.19.2.1^and the soldiers, having twisted together a crown of thorns, put it on of him the head, and a robe purple cast around him,
43.19.3.1^and they began coming up to him and saying, hail, - king of the jews!
43.19.3.2^and they kept giving him blows with the palm.
43.19.4.1^and went forth again outside - pilate, and he says to them, behold, i bring to you him out, so that you may know that no guilt i find in him.
43.19.5.1^went forth therefore - jesus outside, wearing the thorny crown and the purple robe.
43.19.5.2^and he says to them, behold the man!
43.19.6.1^when therefore saw him the chief priests and the officers, they cried out saying, crucify!
43.19.6.2^crucify!
43.19.6.3^says to them - pilate, take him yourselves and crucify him;
43.19.6.4^i for no find in him guilt.
43.19.7.1^answered him the jews, we a law have, and according to the law, he ought to die, because the son of god himself he made.
43.19.8.1^when therefore heard - pilate this - word, the more he was afraid.
43.19.9.1^and he went into the praetorium again, and he says - to jesus, from where are you?
43.19.9.2^- but jesus an answer not did give him.
43.19.10.1^says therefore to him - pilate, to me not speak you?
43.19.10.2^not know you that authority i have to release you, and authority i have to crucify you?
43.19.11.1^answered him jesus, not you would have authority also me against, if not it were given to you from above.
43.19.11.2^because of this, the one having delivered up me to you, greater sin has.
43.19.12.1^out of this - pilate was seeking to release him;
43.19.12.2^- but the jews cried out, saying, if this man you release, not you are a friend - of caesar.
43.19.12.3^everyone - a king himself making, speaks against - caesar.
43.19.13.1^- therefore pilate, having heard the words these, brought out - jesus, and sat down upon the judgment seat at a place called the stone pavement;
43.19.13.2^in hebrew now, gabbatha.
43.19.14.1^it was now the day of preparation of the passover;
43.19.14.2^the hour was about the sixth.
43.19.14.3^and he says to the jews, behold the king of you!
43.19.15.1^they cried out therefore, with him away, away!
43.19.15.2^crucify him!
43.19.15.3^says to them - pilate, the king of you shall i crucify?
43.19.15.4^answered the chief priests, not we have a king, if not caesar.
43.19.16.1^then therefore he delivered him to them, that he might be crucified.
43.19.16.2^they took therefore - jesus.
43.19.17.1^and bearing his own - cross, he went out to the called of the skull place, which is called in hebrew golgotha,
43.19.18.1^where him they crucified, and with him others two, on this side and on that side, in between now - jesus.
43.19.19.1^wrote then also a title - pilate and put it on the cross.
43.19.19.2^it was now written:
43.19.19.3^jesus of nazareth, the king of the jews.
43.19.20.1^this therefore the title many read of the jews, for near was the place, the city, where was crucified - jesus, and it was written in hebrew, in latin, in greek.
43.19.21.1^were saying therefore - to pilate the chief priests of the jews, not write, the king of the jews, but that he said, king i am of the jews.
43.19.22.1^answered - pilate, what i have written, i have written.
43.19.23.1^the then soldiers, when they crucified - jesus, took the garments of him and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and also the tunic.
43.19.23.2^was now the tunic seamless, from the top woven throughout all.
43.19.24.1^they said therefore to one another, not let us tear up it, but let us cast lots for it, whose it will be, that the scripture might be fulfilled that said:
43.19.24.2^they divided the garments of me among them, and for the clothing of me they cast a lot.
43.19.24.3^the indeed therefore soldiers these things did.
43.19.25.1^had been standing now by the cross - of jesus the mother of him, and the sister of the mother of him, mary the wife - of clopas, and mary - magdalene.
43.19.26.1^jesus therefore, having seen his mother and the disciple standing by whom he loved, says to his mother, woman, behold, the son of you.
43.19.27.1^then he says to the disciple, behold the mother of you.
43.19.27.2^and from that - hour took the disciple her to the own.
43.19.28.1^after this, knowing - jesus that now all things had been accomplished, so that might be fulfilled the scripture, he says, i thirst.
43.19.29.1^a vessel had been set there of sour wine full;
43.19.29.2^a sponge therefore filled with sour wine, a stalk of hyssop having put on, they brought it to the mouth.
43.19.30.1^when therefore took the sour wine - jesus, he said, it has been finished.
43.19.30.2^and having bowed the head, he yielded up the spirit.
43.19.31.1^- therefore the jews, because the preparation it was, so that not would remain on the cross the bodies on the sabbath   was for a high - day that - sabbath   asked - pilate that might be broken their - legs, and they might be taken away.
43.19.32.1^came therefore the soldiers, and of the indeed first broke the legs, and of the other - having been crucified with him;
43.19.33.1^to however - jesus having come, when they saw already him having been dead, not they did break his - legs.
43.19.34.1^but one of the soldiers with a spear his - side pierced, and came out immediately blood and water.
43.19.35.1^and the one having seen has borne witness, and true of him is the testimony.
43.19.35.2^and he knows that truth he is speaking, that also you might believe.
43.19.36.1^took place for these things so that the scripture might be fulfilled:
43.19.36.2^bone not one will be broken of him.
43.19.37.1^and again, another scripture says:
43.19.37.2^they will look on the one they have pierced.
43.19.38.1^after then these things, asked - pilate joseph - from arimathea, being a disciple - of jesus   concealed however through the fear of the jews   that he might take away the body - of jesus;
43.19.38.2^and gave permission - pilate.
43.19.38.3^he came therefore and took away the body of him.
43.19.39.1^came now also nicodemus, the one having come to him by night at the first, bearing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about litras a hundred.
43.19.40.1^they took therefore the body - of jesus and bound it in linen cloths, with the spices, as the custom is among the jews to prepare for burial.
43.19.41.1^there was now in the place where he was crucified a garden, and in the garden a tomb new, in which not yet no one was laid.
43.19.42.1^there therefore, on account of the preparation of the jews, because near was the tomb, they laid - jesus.
43.20.1.1^- now the first day of the week, mary - magdalene comes early, dark still it being, to the tomb, and she sees the stone having been removed from the tomb.
43.20.2.1^she runs therefore and comes to simon peter and to the other disciple, whom loved - jesus, and she says to them, they have taken away the lord out of the tomb, and not we know where they have laid him.
43.20.3.1^went forth therefore - peter and the other disciple, and were coming to the tomb.
43.20.4.1^were running now the two together, and the other disciple ran ahead faster - than peter and came first to the tomb.
43.20.5.1^and having stooped down, he sees lying there the linen cloths;
43.20.5.2^not however he entered.
43.20.6.1^comes then also simon peter following him, and he entered into the tomb and sees the linen cloths lying there,
43.20.7.1^and the soudarion, which was upon the head of him, not with the linen cloths lying, but by itself having been folded up in a place.
43.20.8.1^then therefore entered also the other disciple, - having come first to the tomb, and he saw and believed;
43.20.9.1^not yet for understood they the scripture that it behooves him out from the dead to rise.
43.20.10.1^went away therefore again to their homes the disciples.
43.20.11.1^mary however stood at the tomb outside weeping.
43.20.11.2^as therefore she was weeping, she stooped down into the tomb,
43.20.12.1^and she sees two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where had lain the body - of jesus.
43.20.13.1^and say to her they, woman, why weep you?
43.20.13.2^she says to them, because they have taken away the lord of me, and not i know where they have laid him.
43.20.14.1^these things having said, she turned back - around, and she sees - jesus standing there, and not had known that jesus it is.
43.20.15.1^says to her jesus, woman, why do you weep?
43.20.15.2^whom do you seek?
43.20.15.3^she, thinking that the gardener he is, says to him, sir, if you have carried off him, tell me where you have laid him, and i him will take away.
43.20.16.1^says to her jesus, mary.
43.20.16.2^having turned around, she says to him in hebrew, rabboni, that is to say, teacher.
43.20.17.1^says to her jesus, not me touch, not yet for have i ascended to the father;
43.20.17.2^go however to the brothers of me and say to them, i am ascending to the father of me and father of you, and to god of me and god of you.
43.20.18.1^comes mary - magdalene bringing word to the disciples -, i have seen the lord, and that these things he had said to her.
43.20.19.1^it being therefore evening the day same, the first of the week, and the doors having been shut, where were the disciples through the fear of the jews, came - jesus and stood in the midst, and he says to them, peace to you.
43.20.20.1^and this having said, he showed his hands and his side to them.
43.20.20.2^rejoiced then the disciples, having seen the lord.
43.20.21.1^said therefore to them - jesus again, peace to you;
43.20.21.2^as has sent forth me the father, i also send you.
43.20.22.1^and this having said, he breathed on them, and he says to them, receive the spirit holy.
43.20.23.1^if of any, you might forgive the sins, they are forgiven them;
43.20.23.2^if any you might retain, they are retained.
43.20.24.1^thomas however, one of the twelve, the one called didymus, not was with them when came jesus.
43.20.25.1^were saying therefore to him the other disciples, we have seen the lord.
43.20.25.2^- but he said to them, if not i see in the hands of him the mark of the nails, and put the finger of me into the mark of the nails, and put of me the hand into the side of him, no not will i believe.
43.20.26.1^and after days eight again were inside the disciples of him, and thomas with them.
43.20.26.2^comes - jesus, the doors having been shut.
43.20.26.3^and he stood in the midst and said, peace to you.
43.20.27.1^then he says - to thomas, bring the finger of you here, and see the hands of me;
43.20.27.2^and bring the hand of you, and put it into the side of me;
43.20.27.3^and not be unbelieving, but believing.
43.20.28.1^answered thomas and said to him, the lord of me and the god of me!
43.20.29.1^says to him - jesus, because you have seen me, you have believed;
43.20.29.2^blessed are those not having seen, yet having believed.
43.20.30.1^many indeed therefore also other signs did - jesus in the presence of the disciples of him, which not are written in the book this;
43.20.31.1^these however have been written that you may believe that jesus is the christ, the son - of god, and that believing, life you may have in the name of him.
43.21.1.1^after these things, revealed himself again - jesus to the disciples at the sea - of tiberias.
43.21.1.2^he revealed himself now in this way:
43.21.2.1^they were together, simon peter, and thomas - called didymus, and nathanael - from cana - of galilee, and the sons - of zebedee, and others of the disciples his two.
43.21.3.1^says to them simon peter, i am going to fish.
43.21.3.2^they say to him, come also we with you.
43.21.3.3^they went forth and went up into the boat, and during that - night they caught nothing.
43.21.4.1^morning now already having come, stood jesus on the shore;
43.21.4.2^not however knew the disciples that jesus it is.
43.21.5.1^says therefore to them - jesus, children, not any fish have you?
43.21.5.2^they answered him, no.
43.21.6.1^- and he said to them, cast to the right side of the boat the net, and you will find some.
43.21.6.2^they cast therefore, and not it to haul in were they able, from the multitude of the fish.
43.21.7.1^says therefore the disciple that whom loved - jesus - to peter, the lord it is.
43.21.7.2^simon therefore peter, having heard that the lord it is, the outer garment put on he was for naked and he cast himself into the sea.
43.21.8.1^- and the other disciples in the boat came, not for were they far from the land, but about away cubits two hundred, dragging the net with the fish.
43.21.9.1^when therefore they got out onto the land, they see a fire of coals lying, and fish lying on it, and bread.
43.21.10.1^says to them - jesus, bring some of the fish that you have caught now.
43.21.11.1^went up therefore simon peter and drew the net to the land, full of fish large, a hundred fifty three;
43.21.11.2^although so many there are, not was torn the net.
43.21.12.1^says to them - jesus, come, have breakfast.
43.21.12.2^none however dared of the disciples to ask him, you who are?
43.21.12.3^knowing that the lord it is.
43.21.13.1^comes jesus and takes the bread and gives it to them, and the fish likewise.
43.21.14.1^this is now the third time was revealed jesus to the disciples, having been raised out from the dead.
43.21.15.1^when therefore they had dined, says - to simon peter - jesus, simon son of john, love you me more than these?
43.21.15.2^he says to him, yes, lord;
43.21.15.3^you know that i dearly love you.
43.21.15.4^he says to him, feed the lambs of me.
43.21.16.1^he says to him again a second time, simon son of john, love you me?
43.21.16.2^he says to him, yes, lord;
43.21.16.3^you know that i dearly love you.
43.21.16.4^he says to him, shepherd the sheep of me.
43.21.17.1^he says to him the third time, simon son of john, do you dearly love me?
43.21.17.2^was grieved - peter because he said to him the third time, do you dearly love me?
43.21.17.3^and he said to him, lord, all things you know;
43.21.17.4^you know that i dearly love you.
43.21.17.5^says to him - jesus, feed the sheep of me.
43.21.18.1^truly, truly, i say to you, when you were younger, you dressed yourself and walked where you desired;
43.21.18.2^when however you shall be old, you will stretch forth the hands of you, and another you will dress and will bring you where not you do desire.
43.21.19.1^this now he said signifying by what death he will glorify - god.
43.21.19.2^and this having said, he says to him, follow me.
43.21.20.1^having turned, - peter sees the disciple whom loved - jesus following, who also had reclined at the supper on the bosom of him, and said, lord, who is it who is betraying you?
43.21.21.1^him therefore having seen, - peter says - to jesus, lord, this man and what about?
43.21.22.1^says to him - jesus, if him i desire to remain until i come, what is it to you?
43.21.22.2^you me follow!
43.21.23.1^went out therefore this - saying among the brothers, that the disciple that, not dies.
43.21.23.2^not said however to him - jesus that not he dies, but, if him i desire to remain until i come, what is it to you?
43.21.24.1^this is the disciple - bearing witness concerning these things, and the one having written these things, and we know that true of him the testimony is.
43.21.25.1^there are now also other things many that did - jesus, which if they should be written every one, not even itself i suppose the world to have space for the to be written books.
44.1.1.1^the indeed first account i composed concerning all the things, o theophilus, which began - jesus to do both and to teach,
44.1.2.1^until the day, having given orders to the apostles by the spirit holy whom he had chosen, he was taken up,
44.1.3.1^to whom also he presented himself alive after the suffering of him with many proofs, during days forty being seen by them and speaking the things concerning the kingdom - of god.
44.1.4.1^and being assembled together, he instructed them from jerusalem not to depart, but to await the promise of the father:
44.1.4.2^that which you heard of me;
44.1.5.1^for john indeed baptized with water;
44.1.5.2^you however with the spirit will be baptized holy, not after many these days.
44.1.6.1^those indeed therefore having come together, were asking him, saying, lord, if at the time this, are you restoring the kingdom - to israel?
44.1.7.1^he said then to them, not yours it is to know times or seasons which the father put in place by - his own authority.
44.1.8.1^but you will receive power, having come the holy spirit upon you, and you will be for me witnesses, in both jerusalem, and in all - judea, and samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth.
44.1.9.1^and these things having said, beholding they, he was taken up, and a cloud hid him from the eyes of them.
44.1.10.1^and as looking intently they were into the heaven as was going he, then behold men two stood by them in apparel white,
44.1.11.1^who also said, men, galileans, why do you stand looking into - heaven?
44.1.11.2^this - jesus, - having been taken up from you into - heaven, thus will come in that manner you beheld him going into - heaven.
44.1.12.1^then they returned to jerusalem from the mount - called olivet, which is near jerusalem, a sabbath day s holding journey.
44.1.13.1^and when they had entered into the upper room, they went up where they were staying, - both peter and john, and james and andrew, philip and thomas, bartholomew and matthew, james son of alphaeus, and simon the zealot, and judas son of james.
44.1.14.1^these all were steadfastly continuing with one accord - in prayer, with the women, and mary the mother - of jesus, and the brothers of him.
44.1.15.1^and in the days these, having stood up peter in the midst of the brothers, he said   was then the number of names together the same about a hundred twenty
44.1.16.1^men, brothers, it was necessary for to have been fulfilled the scripture which spoke beforehand the spirit - holy by the mouth of david concerning judas, the one having become guide to those having arrested jesus;
44.1.17.1^for numbered he was with us, and was allotted - a share of the ministry this.
44.1.18.1^this man indeed then acquired a field out of the reward - of unrighteousness, and headlong having fallen, he burst open in the middle, and gushed out all the intestines of him.
44.1.19.1^and known it became to all those dwelling in jerusalem, so that was called the field that in the own language of them akeldama, that is, field of blood.
44.1.20.1^it has been written for in the book of psalms:
44.1.20.2^let become the homestead of him desolate, and not let there be one person dwelling in it,  and, the position of him let take another.
44.1.21.1^it behooves therefore the having accompanied us men, during all the time that came in and went out among us the lord jesus,
44.1.22.1^having begun from the baptism of john until the day in which he was taken up from us, a witness of the resurrection of him with us to become one of these.
44.1.23.1^and they put forward two, joseph - called barsabbas, who was called justus, and matthias.
44.1.24.1^and having prayed, they said, you lord, knower of the hearts of all, show which you have chosen of these - two, one
44.1.25.1^to take the place of the ministry this and apostleship, from which turned aside judas to go to the place - own.
44.1.26.1^and they gave lots for them, and fell the lot on matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
44.2.1.1^and during the arriving of the day - of pentecost, they were all together in the one place.
44.2.2.1^and came suddenly out of - heaven a sound, like the rushing of a wind violent, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
44.2.3.1^and there appeared to them dividing tongues as of fire and sat upon one each of them.
44.2.4.1^and they were filled with all spirit holy, and began to speak in other tongues as the spirit was giving to utter forth to them.
44.2.5.1^were now in jerusalem dwelling jews, men devout from every nation of those under - heaven.
44.2.6.1^having come about now the sound of this, came together the multitude and was confounded, because was hearing one each the own language speaking them.
44.2.7.1^they were amazed then and were marveling, saying, not behold all these are who are speaking galileans?
44.2.8.1^and how we hear each the own language of us, in which we were born?
44.2.9.1^parthians, and medes, and elamites;
44.2.9.2^and those inhabiting - mesopotamia, judea also, and cappadocia, pontus and - asia;
44.2.10.1^phrygia both and pamphylia, egypt and the parts - of libya that are around cyrene, and those visiting here from rome;
44.2.11.1^jews both and converts, cretans and arabs   we hear speaking them - in our own tongues the great things - of god!
44.2.12.1^were amazed then all and were perplexed, other to other saying, what wishes this to be?
44.2.13.1^others however mocking were saying -, of new wine full they are.
44.2.14.1^having stood up however - peter with the eleven, he lifted up the voice of him and spoke forth to them:
44.2.14.2^men of judea and those inhabiting jerusalem all, this to you known let be, and give heed to the words of me.
44.2.15.1^not for as you suppose, these are drunkards;
44.2.15.2^it is for the hour third of the day;
44.2.16.1^but this is that having been spoken by the prophet joel:
44.2.17.1^and it will be in the last days, says - god, i will pour out of the spirit of me upon all flesh;
44.2.17.2^and will prophesy the sons of you, and the daughters of you;
44.2.17.3^and the young men of you visions will see, and the elders of you dreams will dream;
44.2.18.1^and even upon the servants of me, and upon the handmaidens of me, in the days those i will pour out of the spirit of me, and they will prophesy.
44.2.19.1^and i will show wonders in - heaven above, and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and vapor of smoke.
44.2.20.1^the sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before coming day of the lord, - great and glorious.
44.2.21.1^and it shall be, everyone who if they shall call upon the name of the lord will be saved.
44.2.22.1^men, israelites, hear the words these:
44.2.22.2^jesus of nazareth, a man having been set forth by - god to you by miracles and wonders and signs, which did by him - god in the midst of you, as you yourselves know,
44.2.23.1^him by the determinate plan and foreknowledge - of god, delivered up by hands lawless, having crucified, you put to death,
44.2.24.1^whom - god raised up, having loosed the agony of death, inasmuch as not it was possible for to be held him by it.
44.2.25.1^david for says about him:
44.2.25.2^i foresaw the lord before me continually everything, because at the right hand of me he is, that not i should be shaken.
44.2.26.1^because of this was glad the heart, of me and rejoiced the tongue of me;
44.2.26.2^and now also the flesh of me will dwell in hope,
44.2.27.1^for not you will abandon the soul of me into hades, nor will you allow the holy one of you to see decay.
44.2.28.1^you have made known to me the paths of life;
44.2.28.2^you will fill me with joy in the presence of you.
44.2.29.1^men, brothers, it is permitted me to speak with freedom to you concerning the patriarch david, that both he died and was buried, and the tomb of him is among us unto the day this.
44.2.30.1^a prophet therefore being, and knowing that with an oath swore to him - god out of the fruit of the loins of him to set upon the throne of him.
44.2.31.1^having foreseen, he spoke concerning the resurrection of the christ, that neither was he abandoned into hades, nor the flesh of him saw decay.
44.2.32.1^this - jesus has raised up - god, whereof all we are witnesses.
44.2.33.1^to the right hand therefore - of god having been exalted, - and the promise of the spirit - holy having received from the father, he has poured out this which you both are seeing and hearing.
44.2.34.1^not for david ascended into the heavens;
44.2.34.2^he says however himself:
44.2.34.3^said the lord to the lord of me, sit at the right hand of me,
44.2.35.1^until - i place the enemies of you, a footstool of the feet of you.
44.2.36.1^assuredly therefore let know all the house of israel that both lord him and christ has made - god   this - jesus whom you crucified.
44.2.37.1^having heard then, they were pierced to the heart;
44.2.37.2^they said then to - peter and the other apostles, what shall we do, men, brothers?
44.2.38.1^peter then to them, repent, he declared, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of the sins of you, and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit.
44.2.39.1^to you for is the promise, and to the children of you, and to all those at a distance, as many as - shall call to himself the lord, the god of us.
44.2.40.1^other and words many he earnestly testified, and was exhorting them, saying, be saved from the generation - perverse this.
44.2.41.1^those indeed therefore having received the word of him were baptized;
44.2.41.2^and were added on the day that, souls about three thousand.
44.2.42.1^they were now steadfastly continuing in the teaching of the apostles, and - in fellowship, the breaking of the bread, and the prayers.
44.2.43.1^there was coming then upon every soul awe, many and both wonders and signs through the apostles were taking place.
44.2.44.1^all now - having believed were together the same and having all things in common;
44.2.45.1^and the possessions and the goods they were selling and were dividing them to all, as - anyone need had.
44.2.46.1^every day and steadfastly continuing with one accord in the temple, breaking then at each house bread, they were partaking of food with gladness and sincerity of heart,
44.2.47.1^praising - god and having favor with all the people.
44.2.47.2^- and the lord kept adding those who were being saved every day to their number.
44.3.1.1^peter now and john were going up into the temple at the hour - of prayer, the ninth.
44.3.2.1^and a certain man, lame from womb of mother of him being, was being carried, whom they placed every day at the gate of the temple - called beautiful - to ask for alms from those who were going into the temple,
44.3.3.1^who having seen peter and john being about to enter into the temple, was asking alms to receive.
44.3.4.1^having looked intently now peter upon him, with - john, he said, look unto us.
44.3.5.1^- and he began to give heed to them, expecting something from them to receive.
44.3.6.1^said however peter, silver and gold none there is to me;
44.3.6.2^what however i have, this to you i give:
44.3.6.3^in the name of jesus christ of nazareth, rise up and walk!
44.3.7.1^and having taken him by the right hand, he raised up him;
44.3.7.2^immediately then were strengthened the feet of him, and the ankles.
44.3.8.1^and leaping up, he stood and began walking, and he entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising - god.
44.3.9.1^and saw all the people him walking and praising - god.
44.3.10.1^they recognized then him, that he was the one for the alms sitting at the beautiful gate of the temple;
44.3.10.2^and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that having happened to him.
44.3.11.1^is clinging now he to peter and - john;
44.3.11.2^ran together all the people to them in the porch - called solomon s, greatly amazed.
44.3.12.1^having seen it however, - peter answered to the people:
44.3.12.2^men, israelites, why wonder you at this?
44.3.12.3^or on us why you look intently, as if by our own power or godliness we have made - to walk him?
44.3.13.1^the god of abraham, and the god of isaac, and the god jacob, the god of the fathers of us, has glorified the servant of him, jesus, whom you indeed betrayed and disowned in the presence of pilate, having adjudged that one to release him.
44.3.14.1^you however the holy and righteous one denied, and requested a man, a murderer, to be granted to you;
44.3.15.1^- and the author - of life you killed, whom - god has raised up out from the dead, whereof we witnesses are.
44.3.16.1^and on the faith in the name of him, this man whom you see and know has strengthened the name of him;
44.3.16.2^and the faith which is through him has given to him the complete soundness this before all of you.
44.3.17.1^and now, brothers, i know that in ignorance you acted, as also the rulers of you.
44.3.18.1^- but god what he foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that should suffer the christ of him, he has fulfilled thus.
44.3.19.1^repent, therefore, and turn again, for the blotting out of your - sins,
44.3.20.1^so that - may come times of refreshing from the presence of the lord, and that he may send the one having been appointed to you, christ jesus,
44.3.21.1^whom it behooves heaven indeed to receive, until the times of restoration of all things, of which spoke - god by the mouth of holy from the age his prophets.
44.3.22.1^moses indeed said -, a prophet to you will raise up the lord the god of you out from the brothers of you, like me;
44.3.22.2^him you will listen to in all things, as many as - he might say to you.
44.3.23.1^it will be that now every soul who, if not might heed the prophet that, will be utterly destroyed out from the people.
44.3.24.1^and all now the prophets from samuel, and those subsequently, as many as have spoken, also have announced the days these.
44.3.25.1^you are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that made - god with the fathers of you, saying to abraham, and in the seed of you will be blessed all the families of the earth.
44.3.26.1^to you first, having raised up - god the servant of him, sent him, blessing you in - turning away each from the wickednesses of you.
44.4.1.1^speaking now of them to the people, came upon them the priests and the captain of the temple and the sadducees,
44.4.2.1^being distressed because of - teaching their the people and proclaiming in - jesus the resurrection - out from the dead;
44.4.3.1^and they laid on them the hands and put them in custody until the next day;
44.4.3.2^it was for evening already.
44.4.4.1^many however of those having heard the word believed, and became the number of the men about thousand five.
44.4.5.1^it came to pass then on the next day were gathered together their - rulers and - elders and - scribes in jerusalem,
44.4.6.1^and annas the high priest, and caiaphas, and john, and alexander, and as many as were of descent high-priestly.
44.4.7.1^and having placed them in the midst, they began to inquire, in what power or in what name did this you?
44.4.8.1^then peter, having been filled with the spirit holy, said to them, rulers of the people and elders,
44.4.9.1^if we this day are being examined as to a good work to the man ailing, by what means he has been healed,
44.4.10.1^known let it be to all you and to all the people of israel that in the name of jesus christ of nazareth, whom you crucified, whom - god raised out from the dead, in him this man stands before you sound.
44.4.11.1^this is the stone - having been rejected by you, the builders, which has become into head of the corner.
44.4.12.1^and not there is in other no one the salvation, not for name is there another under - heaven - having been given among men by which it behooves to be saved us.
44.4.13.1^seeing now the - of peter boldness, and of john, and having understood that men unschooled they are, and ordinary, they were astonished.
44.4.13.2^they recognized then them, that with - jesus they had been.
44.4.14.1^- and the man beholding with them standing - having been healed, nothing they had to contradict.
44.4.15.1^having commanded however them outside the council to go, they began to confer with one another,
44.4.16.1^saying, what shall we do to the men these?
44.4.16.2^that truly for a noteworthy sign has come to pass through them, to all those inhabiting jerusalem is evident, and not we are able to deny it.
44.4.17.1^but that not on further it might spread among the people, let us warn them no longer to speak in the name this to no man.
44.4.18.1^and having called them, they commanded them - at all not to speak nor to teach in the name - of jesus.
44.4.19.1^- but peter and john answering, said to them, whether right it is before - god to you to listen, rather than - god, you must judge;
44.4.20.1^not are able for we, what we have seen and heard, not to speak.
44.4.21.1^- and having further threatened them, they let go them, nothing finding the how they might punish them, on account of the people, because all were glorifying - god for that having happened;
44.4.22.1^years old for was more than forty, the man on whom had taken place the sign this of healing.
44.4.23.1^having been let go now, they came to the own and reported how much to them the chief priests and the elders had said.
44.4.24.1^- and having heard, with one accord they lifted up their voice to - god and said, sovereign lord, you - made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all that is in them,
44.4.25.1^- of the father of us by the spirit holy through the mouth david servant of you having spoken -:
44.4.25.2^why did rage the gentiles, and peoples did devise vain things?
44.4.26.1^took their stand the kings of the earth, and the rulers were gathered together - themselves against the lord and against the christ of him.
44.4.27.1^were gathered together for in truth, in the city this, against the holy servant of you jesus whom you anointed, herod both and pontius pilate, with the gentiles and peoples of israel,
44.4.28.1^to do whatever the hand of you and the purpose of you had determined beforehand to happen.
44.4.29.1^and - now, lord, look upon the threats of them, and grant to the servants of you with boldness all to speak the word of you,
44.4.30.1^in that the hand of you stretch out you for healing, and signs and wonders to take place, through the name of the holy servant of you, jesus.
44.4.31.1^and having prayed they, was shaken the place in which they were assembled, and they were filled with all the holy spirit and were speaking the word - of god with boldness.
44.4.32.1^- and the multitude - having believed were in heart and soul one, and not one anything of that which possessed he, claimed his own to be, but were to them all things in common.
44.4.33.1^and with power great, were giving - testimony the apostles of the resurrection;
44.4.33.2^of the lord jesus grace then abundant was upon all them.
44.4.34.1^not even for in need anyone there was among them;
44.4.34.2^as many as for owners of lands or houses were selling them, were bringing the proceeds of what is sold,
44.4.35.1^and were laying them at the feet of the apostles;
44.4.35.2^distribution was made then to each just as - anyone need had.
44.4.36.1^joseph now - having been called barnabas by the apostles which is translated son of encouragement a levite, a cypriot at the birth,
44.4.37.1^owns by him a field, having sold it, brought the money and laid it at the feet of the apostles.
44.5.1.1^a man now certain, ananias named, with sapphira, the wife of him, sold a property,
44.5.2.1^and he kept back from the proceeds, being aware of it also the wife, and having brought a portion certain, at the feet of the apostles he laid it.
44.5.3.1^said however - peter, ananias, because of why has filled - satan the heart of you to lie to for you the spirit - holy and to keep back from the proceeds of the land?
44.5.4.1^not remaining to you did it remain?
44.5.4.2^and having been sold, in the own authority it was?
44.5.4.3^why - did you purpose in the heart of you the deed this?
44.5.4.4^not you have lied to men, but - to god!
44.5.5.1^hearing now - ananias the words these, having fallen down, he breathed his last.
44.5.5.2^and came fear great upon all those hearing.
44.5.6.1^having arisen then, the younger men covered him, and having carried him out, buried him.
44.5.7.1^it came to pass now about hours three afterward, also the wife of him, not knowing that having come to pass, came in.
44.5.8.1^replied then to her peter, tell me if for so much, the land you sold?
44.5.8.2^- and she said, yes, for so much.
44.5.9.1^- but peter said to her, why is it that have agreed together you to test the spirit of the lord?
44.5.9.2^behold, the feet of those having buried the husband of you are at the door, and they will carry out you.
44.5.10.1^she fell down then immediately at the feet of him and breathed her last.
44.5.10.2^having come in then, the young men found her dead;
44.5.10.3^and having carried out, they buried her by the husband of her.
44.5.11.1^and came fear great upon all the church and upon all those hearing these things.
44.5.12.1^by now the hands of the apostles were happening signs and wonders many among the people.
44.5.12.2^and they were with one accord, all in the colonnade of solomon;
44.5.13.1^of the now rest, no one dared to join them, but were magnifying them the people;
44.5.14.1^more now were added believing in the lord, multitudes of men both, and women,
44.5.15.1^so as even into the streets to bring out the sick, and to put them on cots and mats, that coming of peter, at least the shadow might envelop some of them.
44.5.16.1^were coming together now also the multitude from the surrounding cities jerusalem, bringing the sick and those being tormented by spirits unclean, who were healed all.
44.5.17.1^having risen up however the high priest and all those with him, - being the sect of the sadducees, were filled with jealousy,
44.5.18.1^and they laid the hands on the apostles and put them in the jail public.
44.5.19.1^an angel however of the lord, during the night having opened the doors of the prison, having brought out then them, said,
44.5.20.1^go, and having stood, speak in the temple to the people all the words of the life this.
44.5.21.1^having heard now, they entered at the dawn into the temple and were teaching.
44.5.21.2^having come now the high priest and those with him, they called together the council, even all the senate of the sons of israel, and sent to the prison house to bring them.
44.5.22.1^- and having come, the officers not did find them in the prison;
44.5.22.2^having returned then they reported back,
44.5.23.1^saying -, the prison house we found shut, with all security, and the guards standing before the doors;
44.5.23.2^having opened them however, inside no one we found.
44.5.24.1^when now they heard the words these, - both the captain of the temple and the chief priests were perplexed concerning them, what - might be this.
44.5.25.1^having come then, a certain one reported to them -, behold, the men whom you put in the prison are in the temple, standing and teaching the people!
44.5.26.1^then having gone, the captain with the officers was bringing them, not with force;
44.5.26.2^they were afraid of for the people lest they might be stoned.
44.5.27.1^having brought then them, they set them in the council.
44.5.27.2^and asked them the high priest,
44.5.28.1^saying, not by a charge we commanded you not to teach in the name this?
44.5.28.2^and behold, you have filled - jerusalem with the teaching of you, and you intend to bring upon us the blood of the man this.
44.5.29.1^answering however, peter and the apostles said, to obey it is necessary god, rather than men.
44.5.30.1^the god of the fathers of us raised up jesus, whom you killed, having hanged him on a tree.
44.5.31.1^him - god as prince and savior exalted by the right hand of him, - to give repentance - to israel and forgiveness of sins.
44.5.32.1^and we are witnesses of the things these, and also the spirit - holy, whom has given - god to those obeying him.
44.5.33.1^- and having heard, they were cut to the heart and were desiring to put to death them.
44.5.34.1^having risen up however a certain man in the council, a pharisee named gamaliel, a teacher of the law honored by all the people, he commanded them outside for a short while the men to put.
44.5.35.1^he said then to them, men, israelites, take heed to yourselves with the men these, what you are about to do.
44.5.36.1^before for these - days rose up theudas, affirming to be somebody himself, to whom were joined of men number about four hundred, who was put to death, and all, as many as were persuaded by him, were dispersed, and it came to nothing.
44.5.37.1^after this man rose up judas the galilean in the days of the registration and drew away people after him.
44.5.37.2^and he perished, and all as many as were persuaded by him, were scattered.
44.5.38.1^and - now i say to you, withdraw from the men these, and let alone them, for if be from men, the plan this or the work this, it will be overthrown;
44.5.39.1^if however from god it is, not you will be able to overthrow them, lest ever also fighting against god you would be found.
44.5.39.2^they were persuaded now by him;
44.5.40.1^and having called in the apostles, having beaten, they commanded them not to speak in the name - of jesus, and released them.
44.5.41.1^they indeed therefore departed, rejoicing, from the presence of the council, that they had been counted worthy for the name to suffer dishonor.
44.5.42.1^every then day, in the temple and in house, not they ceased teaching and proclaiming the good news that the christ is jesus.
44.6.1.1^in now the days these, as are multiplying the disciples, there arose a grumbling of the hellenists against the hebrews, because were being overlooked in the distribution - daily the widows of them.
44.6.2.1^having called near then the twelve the multitude of the disciples, they said, not desirable it is for us, having neglected the word - of god, to attend tables.
44.6.3.1^select therefore, brothers, men out from yourselves being well attested, seven full of the spirit and wisdom, whom we will appoint over the task this.
44.6.4.1^we now in the prayer and the ministry of the word will steadfastly continue.
44.6.5.1^and was pleasing the statement before all the multitude;
44.6.5.2^and they chose stephen, a man full of faith and of the spirit holy, and philip, and prochorus, and nicanor, and timon, and parmenas, and nicolas a convert of antioch,
44.6.6.1^whom they set before the apostles;
44.6.6.2^and having prayed, they laid on them the hands.
44.6.7.1^and the word - of god continued to increase, and was multiplied the number of the disciples in jerusalem exceedingly;
44.6.7.2^a great then multitude of the priests were becoming obedient to the faith.
44.6.8.1^stephen now, full grace and power, was performing wonders and signs great among the people.
44.6.9.1^arose however certain of those from the synagogue - called freedmen, including cyrenians and alexandrians and of those from cilicia and asia, disputing with stephen.
44.6.10.1^and not they were able to withstand the wisdom and the spirit by whom he was speaking.
44.6.11.1^then they suborned men, saying -, we have heard him speaking words blasphemous against moses and - god.
44.6.12.1^they stirred up then the people and the elders and the scribes, and having come upon him, they seized him and brought him to the council.
44.6.13.1^they set also witnesses false, saying, the man this, not does stop speaking words against the place - holy this and the law;
44.6.14.1^we have heard for him saying that jesus of nazareth this will destroy the place this and will change the customs that delivered to us moses.
44.6.15.1^and having looked intently on him, all - sitting in the council saw the face of him as the face of an angel.
44.7.1.1^said then the high priest, if these things so are?
44.7.2.1^- and he began to speak:
44.7.2.2^men, brothers, and fathers, listen!
44.7.2.3^the god - of glory appeared to the father of us abraham, being in - mesopotamia, before rather dwelling his in haran,
44.7.3.1^and he said to him, go out from the country of you and from the kindred of you, and come into the land which - to you i will show.
44.7.4.1^then having gone out from the land of chaldeans, he dwelt in haran.
44.7.4.2^and from there, after - died the father of him, he removed him into the land this, in which you now dwell.
44.7.5.1^and not he did give to him an inheritance in it, not even the length of a foot;
44.7.5.2^but he promised to give to him for a possession it, and to the descendants of him after him, not there being to him a child.
44.7.6.1^spoke however thus - god that will be the seed of him a sojourner in a land strange, and they will enslave it, and will mistreat it years four hundred.
44.7.7.1^and the nation to which if they will be in bondage, will judge i, - god said, and after these things they will come forth and will serve me in the place this.
44.7.8.1^and he gave to him the covenant of circumcision;
44.7.8.2^and thus he begat - isaac and circumcised him on the day - eighth;
44.7.8.3^and isaac - jacob, and jacob the twelve patriarchs.
44.7.9.1^and the patriarchs, having envied - joseph, sold him into egypt.
44.7.9.2^but was - god with him,
44.7.10.1^and rescued him out of all the tribulations of him, and gave him favor and wisdom before pharaoh, king of egypt;
44.7.10.2^and he appointed him ruler over egypt, and over all the house of him.
44.7.11.1^came then a famine upon all - of egypt and canaan, and affliction great, and not were finding sustenance the fathers of us.
44.7.12.1^having heard now jacob there is grain in egypt, he sent forth the fathers of us first;
44.7.13.1^and on the second time, was made known joseph to brothers of him, and known became - to pharaoh the family - of joseph.
44.7.14.1^having sent then joseph, he called for jacob, the father of him, and all the kindred, in all souls seventy five.
44.7.15.1^and went down jacob into egypt and died, he and the fathers of us,
44.7.16.1^and they were carried over into shechem and were placed in the tomb which had bought abraham for a sum of silver from the sons of hamor in shechem.
44.7.17.1^as now was drawing near the time of the promise that had made - god - to abraham, increased the people and multiplied in egypt,
44.7.18.1^until that there arose king another over egypt, who not knew - joseph.
44.7.19.1^he having dealt treacherously with the race of us, he mistreated the fathers of us, - making them the infants abandon of them unto the not they would live.
44.7.20.1^in that time was born moses, and he was beautiful - to god, who was brought up months three in the house of the father.
44.7.21.1^having been set outside then he, took up him the daughter of pharaoh, and brought up him for herself for a son.
44.7.22.1^and was instructed moses in all the wisdom of the egyptians;
44.7.22.2^he was now mighty in words and deeds of him.
44.7.23.1^when then was fulfilled to him of forty years a period, it came into the mind of him to visit the brothers of him, the sons of israel.
44.7.24.1^and having seen a certain one being wronged, he defended him and did vengeance for the one being oppressed, having struck down the egyptian.
44.7.25.1^he was supposing now to understand the brothers of him that - god by the hand of him is giving salvation them, - but not they understood.
44.7.26.1^on the and following day, he appeared to those who were quarreling and urged them to peace, having said, men, brothers you are.
44.7.26.2^so that why wrong you one another?
44.7.27.1^the one however mistreating the neighbor pushed away him, having said, who you appointed, ruler and judge over us?
44.7.28.1^not to kill me you desire, the same way you put to death yesterday the egyptian?
44.7.29.1^fled then moses at the remark this, and became exiled in the land of midian, where he begat sons two.
44.7.30.1^and having been passed years forty, appeared to him in the wilderness of the mount sinai an angel in a flame of fire of a bush.
44.7.31.1^- and moses having seen it, marveled at the vision;
44.7.31.2^coming near then of him to behold it, there was the voice of the lord:
44.7.32.1^i am the god of the fathers of you, the god of abraham, and of isaac, and of jacob.
44.7.32.2^terrified then having become moses, not he dared to look.
44.7.33.1^said then to him the lord, take off the sandal of the feet of you, - for the place on which you stand, ground holy is.
44.7.34.1^having seen, i saw the oppression of the people of me - in egypt, and the groans of them i have heard, and i have come down to deliver them;
44.7.34.2^and now come, i will send you to egypt.
44.7.35.1^this - moses, whom they rejected, having said, who you appointed ruler and judge?
44.7.35.2^him whom god as and ruler and redeemer sent by the hand of the angel - having appeared to him in the bush
44.7.36.1^this one led out them, having done wonders and signs in the land of egypt, and in the red sea, and in the wilderness years forty.
44.7.37.1^this is the moses - having said to the sons of israel, a prophet for you will raise up - god out from the brothers of you, like me.
44.7.38.1^this is the one having been in the congregation in the wilderness, with the angel - speaking to him in the mount sinai, and of the fathers of us, who received oracles living to give to us,
44.7.39.1^to whom not were willing obedient to be the fathers of us, but thrust away, and turned back in the hearts of them to egypt,
44.7.40.1^having said - to aaron, make us gods who will go before us.
44.7.40.2^- as for moses this, who brought out us from the land of egypt, not we know what has happened to him.
44.7.41.1^and they made a calf in the days those and offered a sacrifice to the idol, and they were rejoicing in the works of the hands of them.
44.7.42.1^turned away however - god and delivered them to worship the host of heaven, as it has been written in the book of the prophets:
44.7.42.2^not slain beasts and sacrifices did you offer to me, years forty in the wilderness, o house of israel?
44.7.43.1^and you took up the tabernacle - of moloch, and the star of the god of you rephan, the images that you made to worship them;
44.7.43.2^and i will remove you beyond babylon.
44.7.44.1^the tabernacle of the testimony was with fathers of us in the wilderness, just as had commanded the one speaking - to moses, to make it according to the pattern that he had seen,
44.7.45.1^which also brought it, having received by succession, the fathers of us, with joshua in the taking possession of the nations whom drove out - god from the face of the fathers of us, until the days of david,
44.7.46.1^who found favor before - god and asked to find a dwelling place for the house of jacob.
44.7.47.1^solomon however built him the house.
44.7.48.1^yet not the most high in hand-made houses dwells.
44.7.48.2^as the prophet says:
44.7.49.1^- heaven is to me a throne, - and the earth a footstool of the feet of me.
44.7.49.2^what kind of house will you build me, says the lord, or what is the place of the rest of me?
44.7.50.1^not the hand of me has made these things all?
44.7.51.1^stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and - ears, you always the spirit - holy resist;
44.7.51.2^as the fathers of you, also you.
44.7.52.1^which of the prophets not did persecute the fathers of you?
44.7.52.2^and they killed those having foretold about the coming of the righteous one, of whom now you betrayers and murderers have become,
44.7.53.1^who received the law by the ordination of angels, and not have kept it.
44.7.54.1^hearing now these things, they were cut in the hearts of them and began gnashing the teeth at him.
44.7.55.1^he being however full of the spirit holy, having looked intently into - heaven, saw the glory of god and jesus standing at the right hand - of god,
44.7.56.1^and he said, behold, i see the heavens having been opened, and the son - of man at the right hand standing - of god.
44.7.57.1^having cried out then in a voice loud, they held the ears of them and rushed with one accord upon him,
44.7.58.1^and having cast him out of the city, they began to stone him.
44.7.58.2^and the witnesses laid aside the garments of them at the feet of a young man named saul.
44.7.59.1^and as they were stoning - stephen, he was calling out and saying, lord jesus, receive the spirit of me.
44.7.60.1^having fallen then on his knees, he cried in a voice loud, lord, not place to them this - sin.
44.7.60.2^and this having said, he fell asleep.
44.8.1.1^saul now was there consenting to the killing of him.
44.8.1.2^arose then on that - day a persecution great against the church which was in jerusalem.
44.8.1.3^all then were scattered throughout the regions - of judea and samaria, except the apostles.
44.8.2.1^buried now - stephen men devout, and made lamentation great over him.
44.8.3.1^saul however was destroying the church;
44.8.3.2^houses after - houses entering, dragging off then men and women, he was delivering them to prison.
44.8.4.1^those indeed therefore having been scattered went about, preaching the word.
44.8.5.1^philip now, having gone down to - a city - of samaria, was proclaiming to them the christ.
44.8.6.1^were giving heed now the crowds to the things being spoken by - philip with one accord, in the time to hear them and to see the signs that he was performing.
44.8.7.1^many for of those having spirits unclean, crying voice in a loud, they were coming out of them;
44.8.7.2^many now, having been paralyzed and lame, were healed.
44.8.8.1^there was then great joy in the city that.
44.8.9.1^a man now certain, named simon, had been formerly in the city practicing sorcery and amazing the people - of samaria, declaring to be someone himself great,
44.8.10.1^to whom were giving heed all, from small to great, saying, this one is the power - of god that is called great.
44.8.11.1^they were giving heed now to him, because the long time with the magic arts he had amazed them.
44.8.12.1^when however they believed - philip, proclaiming the gospel concerning the kingdom - of god, and the name of jesus christ, they were baptized, men both and women.
44.8.13.1^- and simon also himself believed, and having been baptized, was steadfastly continuing - with philip.
44.8.13.2^beholding then the signs and miracles great being performed, he was amazed.
44.8.14.1^having heard now the in jerusalem apostles that had received - samaria the word - of god, they sent to them peter and john,
44.8.15.1^who having come down, prayed for them that they might receive the spirit holy.
44.8.16.1^not yet for he was upon any of them fallen;
44.8.16.2^only however baptized they had been into the name of the lord jesus.
44.8.17.1^then they began laying the hands upon them, and they received the spirit holy.
44.8.18.1^having seen now - of simon that through the laying on of the hands of the apostles was given the spirit, he offered to them money,
44.8.19.1^saying, give also to me the authority this, that on whom if i may lay the hands, he may receive the spirit holy.
44.8.20.1^peter however said to him, the silver of you, with you may it be to destruction, because the gift - of god you thought by money to be obtained!
44.8.21.1^no there is to you part, nor lot, in the matter this;
44.8.21.2^the for heart of you not is right before - god.
44.8.22.1^repent therefore of the wickedness of yours this, and pray earnestly to the lord, if indeed will be forgiven you the intent of the heart of you;
44.8.23.1^in for the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity, i see you being.
44.8.24.1^answering now, - simon said, pray earnestly you on behalf of me to the lord, so that nothing may come upon me of which you have spoken.
44.8.25.1^they indeed therefore having earnestly testified, and having spoken the word of the lord, traveled back to jerusalem, to many then villages of the samaritans they were preaching the gospel.
44.8.26.1^an angel now of the lord spoke to philip, saying, rise up and go toward the south, to the road - going down from jerusalem to gaza.
44.8.26.2^this is the desert road.
44.8.27.1^and having risen up, he went.
44.8.27.2^and behold, a man an ethiopian, a eunuch, a potentate of candace queen of the ethiopians, who was over all the treasure of her, who had come to worship to jerusalem,
44.8.28.1^he was then returning and sitting in the chariot of him, and he was reading the prophet isaiah.
44.8.29.1^said then the spirit - to philip, go near and join yourself to the chariot this.
44.8.30.1^having run up then, - philip heard him reading isaiah the prophet, and said, then also understand you what you are reading?
44.8.31.1^- and he said, how for - could i be able if not someone will guide me?
44.8.31.2^he invited then - philip, having come up, to sit with him.
44.8.32.1^- now the passage of the scripture which he was reading was this:
44.8.32.2^as a sheep to slaughter he was led, and as a lamb before the one shearing him is silent, so not he opens the mouth of him.
44.8.33.1^in the humiliation of him, - justice from him was taken away.
44.8.33.2^the generation of him, who will describe?
44.8.33.3^for is removed from the earth the life of him.
44.8.34.1^answering now, the eunuch - to philip said, i pray you, concerning whom the prophet says this?
44.8.34.2^concerning himself, or concerning other some?
44.8.35.1^having opened then - philip the mouth of him and having begun from the scripture this, he proclaimed the good news to him   - jesus.
44.8.36.1^as then they were going along the road, they came upon some water, and says the eunuch, behold water;
44.8.36.2^what prevents me to be baptized?
44.8.38.1^and he commanded to stop the chariot.
44.8.38.2^and they went down both to the water, - both philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.
44.8.39.1^when now they came up out of the water, the spirit of the lord carried away - philip, and not saw him no longer the eunuch;
44.8.39.2^he went for the way of him, rejoicing.
44.8.40.1^philip however was found at azotus, and passing through, he was proclaiming the gospel to the towns all, until - coming his to caesarea.
44.9.1.1^- but saul, still breathing out threats and murder toward the disciples of the lord, having gone to the high priest,
44.9.2.1^requested from him letters in damascus to the synagogues, so that if any he found of the way, being men both and women, having bound, he might bring them to jerusalem.
44.9.3.1^in now - proceeding, it came to pass as he draws near - to damascus, suddenly also him flashed around a light from - heaven.
44.9.4.1^and having fallen on the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, saul, saul, why me do you persecute?
44.9.5.1^he said then, who are you, lord?
44.9.5.2^- and he said, i am jesus, whom you are persecuting.
44.9.6.1^but rise up and enter into the city, and it will be told you that what you it behooves to do.
44.9.7.1^- and the men - traveling with him stood speechless, hearing indeed the voice, no one however seeing.
44.9.8.1^rose up then saul from the ground;
44.9.8.2^having been opened however the eyes of him, nothing he could see.
44.9.8.3^leading by the hand then him, they brought him to damascus.
44.9.9.1^and he was days three without seeing, and neither did he eat nor drink.
44.9.10.1^there was now a certain disciple in damascus named ananias.
44.9.10.2^and said to him in a vision the lord, ananias.
44.9.10.3^- and he said, behold me, lord.
44.9.11.1^- and the lord to him said, having risen up, go into the street - called straight, and seek in the house of judas saul named, of tarsus.
44.9.11.2^behold for he is praying,
44.9.12.1^and he saw a man in a vision ananias named, having come and having put on him the hands, so that he might see again.
44.9.13.1^answered but ananias, lord, i have heard from many concerning the man this, how many evils to saints of you he did in jerusalem;
44.9.14.1^and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all those calling on the name of you.
44.9.15.1^said however to him the lord, go, for a vessel of choice is to me this man, - to carry the name of me before the gentiles, and also kings, the sons then of israel;
44.9.16.1^i for will show to him how much it behooves him for the name of me to suffer.
44.9.17.1^went away then ananias and entered into the house;
44.9.17.2^and having laid upon him the hands, he said, saul brother, the lord has sent me, jesus, the one having appeared to you on the road by which you were coming, that you may see again and be filled of the spirit holy.
44.9.18.1^and immediately fell of him from the eyes something like scales, he regained his sight also.
44.9.18.2^and having risen up, he was baptized;
44.9.19.1^and having taken food, he was strengthened.
44.9.19.2^he was now with the in damascus disciples days some.
44.9.20.1^and immediately in the synagogues he began proclaiming - jesus, that he is the son - of god.
44.9.21.1^were amazed then all - hearing, and were saying, not this is the one having ravaged in jerusalem those calling on the name this?
44.9.21.2^and here for this he had come, that having been bound, them he might bring to the chief priests.
44.9.22.1^saul however all the more was empowered, and kept confounding the jews - dwelling in damascus, proving that this is the christ.
44.9.23.1^when now had passed days many, plotted together the jews to kill him;
44.9.24.1^became known however - to saul the plot of them.
44.9.24.2^they were closely watching now also the gates day and also night, so that him they might kill;
44.9.25.1^having taken him however the disciples of him by night, through the wall they let down him, having lowered him in a basket.
44.9.26.1^having arrived then in jerusalem, he was attempting to join the disciples.
44.9.26.2^and all were afraid of him, not believing that he is a disciple.
44.9.27.1^barnabas however, having taken him, brought him to the apostles, and he related to them how on the road he had seen the lord, and that he had spoken to him, and how in damascus he had spoken boldly in the name - of jesus.
44.9.28.1^and he was with them, coming in and going out in jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the lord.
44.9.29.1^he was speaking also and was debating with the hellenists;
44.9.29.2^- but they were seeking to kill him.
44.9.30.1^having known it however, the brothers brought down him to caesarea and sent away him to tarsus.
44.9.31.1^the indeed then church throughout all - of judea, and galilee, and samaria, had peace, being edified and going on in the fear of the lord;
44.9.31.2^and in the comfort of the holy spirit they were multiplied.
44.9.32.1^it came to pass that now peter, passing through all quarters, went down also to the saints - inhabiting lydda.
44.9.33.1^he found then there a man certain, named aeneas, for years eight lying on a bed, who was paralyzed.
44.9.34.1^and said to him - peter, aeneas, heals you jesus christ;
44.9.34.2^rise up, and make the bed for yourself.
44.9.34.3^and immediately he rose up.
44.9.35.1^and saw him all those inhabiting lydda and - sharon, who turned to the lord.
44.9.36.1^in joppa now certain there was a disciple named tabitha, which translated is called dorcas.
44.9.36.2^she was full of works good, and of alms that she continually did.
44.9.37.1^it came to pass however, in the days those, that having become sick, she died.
44.9.37.2^having washed her then, put her they in an upper room.
44.9.38.1^near now being lydda - joppa, the disciples, having heard that peter is in it, sent two men to him, imploring , not to delay coming to us.
44.9.39.1^having risen up then, peter went with them, who having arrived, brought him into the upper room.
44.9.39.2^and stood by him all the widows, weeping and showing the tunics and garments that had made, with them being, - dorcas.
44.9.40.1^having put then outside all - peter, and having bowed the knees, he prayed.
44.9.40.2^and having turned to the body he said, tabitha, arise!
44.9.40.3^- and she opened the eyes of her, and having seen - peter, she sat up.
44.9.41.1^having given then her his hand, he raised up her.
44.9.41.2^having called then the saints and the widows, he presented her living.
44.9.42.1^known then it became throughout all - of joppa, and believed many on the lord.
44.9.43.1^it came to pass then, days many he stayed in joppa with a certain simon, a tanner.
44.10.1.1^a man now certain in caesarea, named cornelius, was a centurion of the cohort that is called italian,
44.10.2.1^devout and fearing - god with all the household of him, doing alms many to the people, and praying to god continually all.
44.10.3.1^he saw in a vision clearly, as if about hour the ninth of the day, an angel - of god having come to him and having said to him, cornelius!
44.10.4.1^- and having looked intently on him, and afraid having become, he said, what is it, lord?
44.10.4.2^he said then to him, the prayers of you and the alms of you have ascended as a memorial before - god.
44.10.5.1^and now send men to joppa and summon simon, a man who is called peter.
44.10.6.1^he lodges with a certain simon a tanner, whose is the house by the sea.
44.10.7.1^when then had departed the angel - speaking to him, having called two of the servants and a soldier devout of those who are attending him,
44.10.8.1^and having related all things to them, he sent them to - joppa.
44.10.9.1^on the now next day, as are journeying these and the city approaching, went up peter on the housetop to pray, about hour the sixth.
44.10.10.1^he became then hungry and desired to eat;
44.10.10.2^as were preparing however they, fell upon him a trance,
44.10.11.1^and he beholds - heaven opening, and descending a vessel certain, as a sheet great, by four corners being let down upon the earth,
44.10.12.1^in which were all the quadrupeds, and creeping things of the earth, and birds of heaven.
44.10.13.1^and came a voice to him:
44.10.13.2^having risen up, peter, kill and eat!
44.10.14.1^- and peter said, in no way, lord;
44.10.14.2^for never have i eaten anything common or unclean.
44.10.15.1^and a voice came again for the second time to him:
44.10.15.2^what - god has cleansed, you not call common.
44.10.16.1^this now took place for three times, and immediately was taken up the vessel into - heaven.
44.10.17.1^while then in himself was perplexed - peter what - might be the vision that he had seen, behold, the men - having been sent from - cornelius, having inquired for the house - of simon, stood at the gate.
44.10.18.1^and having called out, they were asking if simon who is called peter here is lodged.
44.10.19.1^- and of peter thinking over the vision, said to him the spirit, behold, men three are seeking you.
44.10.20.1^but having risen, go down and proceed with them, nothing doubting, because i have sent them.
44.10.21.1^having gone down then peter to the men, he said, behold, i am whom you seek;
44.10.21.2^what is the cause for which you are here?
44.10.22.1^- and they said, cornelius a centurion, a man righteous and fearing - god, being well testified to then by all the nation of the jews, was divinely instructed by an angel holy to send for you to the house of him, and to hear a message from you.
44.10.23.1^having called in therefore them he lodged them.
44.10.23.2^on the now next day having risen up, he went forth with them, and some of the brothers those from joppa went with him.
44.10.24.1^on the now next day, he entered into - caesarea, - and cornelius was expecting them, having called together the relatives of him and - close friends.
44.10.25.1^as then was - entering - peter, having met him - cornelius, having fallen at the feet, worshiped him.
44.10.26.1^- but peter lifted up him, saying, rise up, also i myself a man am.
44.10.27.1^and talking with him, he entered, and he finds having gathered together many.
44.10.28.1^he was saying then to them, you know how unlawful it is for a man a jew to unite himself or to come near to a foreigner.
44.10.28.2^to me however god has shown, not common or unclean to call man.
44.10.29.1^therefore also without objection i came, having been summoned.
44.10.29.2^i inquire therefore, for what reason did you summon me?
44.10.30.1^and - cornelius was saying, ago four days, until this the hour, i was at the ninth hour praying in the house of me;
44.10.30.2^and behold, a man stood before me in apparel bright,
44.10.31.1^and said, cornelius, has been heard your - prayer, and the alms of you have been remembered before - god.
44.10.32.1^send therefore to joppa and call for simon, who is called peter;
44.10.32.2^he lodges in the house of simon, a tanner by the sea.
44.10.33.1^at once therefore i sent to you;
44.10.33.2^you then well did, having come.
44.10.33.3^now therefore, all we before - god are present to hear all the things having been commanded you by the lord.
44.10.34.1^having opened then peter the mouth, he said, of a truth i understand that not is one who shows partiality - god,
44.10.35.1^but in every nation, the one fearing him and working righteousness, acceptable to him is,
44.10.36.1^the word that he sent to the sons of israel, proclaiming the gospel, peace by jesus christ   he is of all lord.
44.10.37.1^you yourselves know the having come declaration through all - judea, having begun from - galilee, after the baptism that proclaimed john:
44.10.38.1^jesus - from nazareth, how anointed him - god spirit with holy and with power, who went about doing good and healing all those being oppressed by the devil, because - god was with him.
44.10.39.1^and we are witnesses of all things that he did in both the region of the jews and in jerusalem, whom also they put to death, having hanged him on a tree.
44.10.40.1^this one - god raised up on the third day, and gave him manifest to become,
44.10.41.1^not to all the people, but to the witnesses - having been chosen beforehand by - god, to us who did eat with and drink with him after - rising his out from the dead.
44.10.42.1^and he instructed us to proclaim to the people and to testify fully that he is the one having been appointed by - god as judge of living and dead.
44.10.43.1^to him all the prophets bear witness that forgiveness of sins receives through the name of him everyone - believing in him.
44.10.44.1^still speaking - of peter the words these, fell the spirit - holy upon all those hearing the word.
44.10.45.1^and were amazed the from the circumcision believers, as many as had come with - peter, that even upon the gentiles the gift of the holy spirit has been poured out.
44.10.46.1^they were hearing for them speaking in tongues and magnifying - god.
44.10.46.2^then answered peter,
44.10.47.1^if not the water is able to withhold anyone - not to baptize these who the spirit - holy have received, just as also have we?
44.10.48.1^he commanded now them in the name of jesus christ to be baptized.
44.10.48.2^then they asked him to remain days some.
44.11.1.1^heard now the apostles and the brothers - being in - judea that also the gentiles had received the word - of god.
44.11.2.1^when also went up peter to jerusalem, began contending with him those of the circumcision,
44.11.3.1^saying -, you went to men uncircumcision having, and ate with them.
44.11.4.1^having begun now peter, he set it forth to them in order, saying,
44.11.5.1^i was in the city of joppa praying, and i saw in a trance a vision, descending a vessel certain like a sheet great, by four corners being let down out of - heaven, and it came down as far as me.
44.11.6.1^on it having looked intently, i was observing it, and i saw the quadrupeds of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the birds of the air.
44.11.7.1^i heard then also a voice saying to me, having risen up, peter, kill and eat.
44.11.8.1^i said however, in no way, lord, for common or unclean nothing ever has entered into the mouth of me.
44.11.9.1^answered however the voice for a second time out of - heaven, what - god has cleansed, you not do call unholy.
44.11.10.1^this now happened on three times, and was drawn up again all into - heaven.
44.11.11.1^and behold, immediately three men stood at the house in which i was, having been sent from caesarea to me.
44.11.12.1^told now the spirit me to go with them, not having discriminated.
44.11.12.2^went now with me also - six brothers these, and we entered into the house of the man.
44.11.13.1^he related then to us how he had seen the angel in the house of him, having stood and having said, send forth to joppa, and send for simon, who is called peter,
44.11.14.1^who will speak words to you, in which will be saved you and all the household of you.
44.11.15.1^in then - beginning my to speak, fell the spirit - holy upon them, even as also upon us in the beginning.
44.11.16.1^i remembered then the word of the lord, how he had said, john indeed baptized with water;
44.11.16.2^you however will be baptized with the spirit holy.
44.11.17.1^if then the same gift has given to them - god as also to us having believed on the lord jesus christ, i how was able to forbid - god?
44.11.18.1^having heard then these things, they were silent and glorified - god, saying, then indeed also to the gentiles - god - repentance unto life has given.
44.11.19.1^those indeed therefore having been scattered by the tribulation - having taken place over stephen, passed through to phoenicia, and cyprus, and antioch, to no one speaking the word if not only to jews.
44.11.20.1^were however some of them, men of cyprus and of cyrene, who having come into antioch, were speaking also to the hellenists, proclaiming the gospel   the lord jesus.
44.11.21.1^and was the hand of the lord with them;
44.11.21.2^a great then number - having believed, turned to the lord.
44.11.22.1^was heard now the report in the ears of the church - being in jerusalem concerning them, and they sent forth barnabas to go as far as antioch,
44.11.23.1^who having come and having seen the grace of - god, rejoiced and was exhorting all with resolute purpose - of heart to abide in the lord.
44.11.24.1^for he was a man good, and full of the spirit holy, and of faith.
44.11.24.2^and was added a crowd large to the lord.
44.11.25.1^he went forth then to tarsus to seek saul,
44.11.26.1^and having found him, he brought him to antioch.
44.11.26.2^it came to pass that now they also a year whole gathered together in the church and taught a crowd large.
44.11.26.3^were called then first in antioch the disciples, christians.
44.11.27.1^in these now - days came down from jerusalem prophets to antioch.
44.11.28.1^having risen up now one of them named agabus, he signified by the spirit that a famine great is about to be over all the world   which came to pass under claudius.
44.11.29.1^- and the disciples, as was prospered anyone, determined each of them, for ministry, to send to the dwelling in - judea brothers,
44.11.30.1^which also they did, having sent it to the elders by the hand of barnabas and saul.
44.12.1.1^at that now - time, put forth herod the king the hands to mistreat some of those of the church.
44.12.2.1^he put to death then james, the brother of john, with the sword.
44.12.3.1^having seen now that pleasing it is to the jews, he proceeded to take also peter   these were now the days of the unleavened bread
44.12.4.1^whom also having seized, he put in prison, having delivered him to four sets of four soldiers to guard him, intending after the passover to bring out him to the people.
44.12.5.1^- indeed therefore peter was kept in the prison;
44.12.5.2^prayer however was fervent being made by the church to - god concerning him.
44.12.6.1^when then was about to bring forth him - herod, the night that, was - peter sleeping between two soldiers, having been bound with chains two, guards also before the door were watching the prison.
44.12.7.1^and behold, an angel of the lord stood by, and a light shone in the cell.
44.12.7.2^having struck then the side - of peter, he woke up him, saying, rise up in haste.
44.12.7.3^and fell of him the chains off the hands.
44.12.8.1^said then the angel to him, gird yourself about and put on the sandals of you.
44.12.8.2^he did and so.
44.12.8.3^and he says to him, wrap around you the cloak of you and follow me.
44.12.9.1^and having gone forth, he was following and not did know that real is what is happening by means of the angel;
44.12.9.2^he was thinking however a vision he saw.
44.12.10.1^having passed through then a first guard and a second, they came to the gate - iron - leading into the city, which by itself opened to them.
44.12.10.2^and having gone out they went on through street one, and immediately departed the angel from him.
44.12.11.1^and - peter to himself having come, said, now i know truly that has sent forth the lord the angel of him and delivered me out of the hand of herod and all the expectation of the people of the jews.
44.12.12.1^having considered it also, he came to the house of mary the mother of john, who is called mark, where were many having gathered together and praying.
44.12.13.1^having knocked then of him at the door of the gate, came a girl to answer, named rhoda.
44.12.14.1^and having recognized the voice - of peter, from - joy not she opened the gate, having run in;
44.12.14.2^but she reported to be standing - peter before the gate.
44.12.15.1^- and to her they said, you are out of your mind.
44.12.15.2^- but she kept insisting it so to be.
44.12.15.3^- and they kept saying, the angel it is of him.
44.12.16.1^- but peter continued knocking;
44.12.16.2^having opened it then, they saw him and were amazed.
44.12.17.1^having made a sign then to them with the hand to be silent, he related to them how the lord him had brought out of the prison.
44.12.17.2^he said then, report to james and to the brothers these things.
44.12.17.3^and having gone out, he went to another place.
44.12.18.1^having come now day, there was disturbance no small among the soldiers, what then of - peter has become.
44.12.19.1^herod then having sought after him, and not having found him, having examined the guards, he commanded them to be led away to death.
44.12.19.2^and having gone down from - judea to caesarea, he stayed there.
44.12.20.1^he had been now furiously angry with the tyrians and sidonians;
44.12.20.2^with one accord then they came to him.
44.12.20.3^and having gained blastus, who was over the bedchamber of the king, they were seeking peace, because of - being nourished their - region by the king s.
44.12.21.1^on the appointed now day, - herod, having put on apparel royal and having sat on the throne, was making an address to them.
44.12.22.1^- and the people were crying out, of a god this is the voice, and not of a man!
44.12.23.1^immediately then struck him an angel of the lord, in return for that not he gave the glory - to god;
44.12.23.2^and having been eaten by worms, he breathed his last.
44.12.24.1^- but the word - of god continued to grow and to multiply.
44.12.25.1^barnabas then and saul returned, to jerusalem having fulfilled the mission, having taken with them john, the one having been called mark.
44.13.1.1^there were now in antioch, in the being there church, prophets and teachers, - both barnabas and simeon who was called niger, and lucius the cyrenian, manaen also   herod the tetrarch brought up with   and saul.
44.13.2.1^as were ministering now they to the lord and fasting, said the spirit - holy, set apart then to me - barnabas and saul for the work to which i have called them.
44.13.3.1^then having fasted, and having prayed, and having laid the hands on them, they sent them off.
44.13.4.1^they indeed therefore having been sent forth by the holy spirit, went down to seleucia.
44.13.4.2^from there then they sailed to cyprus.
44.13.5.1^and having come into salamis, they began proclaiming the word - of god in the synagogues of the jews.
44.13.5.2^they had now also john as a helper.
44.13.6.1^having passed through now all the island, as far as paphos, they found a man   a certain magician, a false prophet jewish   whose name was bar-jesus,
44.13.7.1^who was with the proconsul sergius paulus, man an intelligent.
44.13.7.2^he having called to him barnabas and saul, desired to hear the word - of god.
44.13.8.1^was opposing however them elymas the magician   thus for means the name of him   seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith.
44.13.9.1^saul then, - also called paul, having been filled the spirit holy, having looked intently upon him,
44.13.10.1^said, o full of all deceit and all craft, son of the devil, enemy of all righteousness, not will you cease perverting the ways the of lord - straight?
44.13.11.1^and now behold, the hand of the lord is upon you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun during a season.
44.13.11.2^immediately then fell upon him mist and darkness, and going about he was seeking someone to lead him by the hand.
44.13.12.1^then having seen the proconsul that having happened, he believed, being astonished at the teaching of the lord.
44.13.13.1^having sailed then from - paphos with those around him, paul came to perga - of pamphylia.
44.13.13.2^john however having departed from them, returned to jerusalem.
44.13.14.1^they now, having passed through from - perga, came to antioch - of pisidia, and having gone into the synagogue on the day of the sabbaths, they sat down.
44.13.15.1^after then the reading of the law and of the prophets, sent the rulers of the synagogue to them, saying, men, brothers, if any there is among you a word of exhortation toward the people, speak.
44.13.16.1^having risen up then paul, and having made a sign with the hand, he said, men, israelites, and those fearing - god, listen.
44.13.17.1^the god of the people this of israel chose the fathers of us, and the people exalted in the sojourn in the land of egypt, and with arm uplifted, brought them out of it,
44.13.18.1^and of about forty years for a period he endured the ways their in the wilderness,
44.13.19.1^and having destroyed nations seven in the land of canaan, he gave as an inheritance the land of them
44.13.20.1^during years four hundred and fifty.
44.13.20.2^and after these things, he gave them judges until samuel the prophet.
44.13.21.1^then they asked for a king, and gave to them - god, - saul son of kish, a man of the tribe of benjamin, years forty.
44.13.22.1^and having removed him, he raised up - david to them as king, to whom also he said, having carried witness:
44.13.22.2^i have found david the son of jesse a man according to the heart of me, who will do all the will of me.
44.13.23.1^of this man - god, of the seed, according to promise, has brought - to israel the savior jesus
44.13.24.1^having proclaimed john before the face of the coming of him a baptism of repentance to all the people of israel.
44.13.25.1^while then was fulfilling john the course, he was saying, whom me do you suppose to be?
44.13.25.2^not am i he, but behold, he comes after me, of whom not i am worthy a sandal of the feet to untie.
44.13.26.1^men, brothers, sons of the family of abraham, and those among you fearing - god, to us the message of the salvation this has been sent.
44.13.27.1^those for dwelling in jerusalem and the rulers of them, him not having known, and the voices of the prophets that on every sabbath are being read, having condemned him they fulfilled them.
44.13.28.1^and no cause of death having found, they begged pilate to put to death him.
44.13.29.1^when then they had finished all the things about him having been written, having taken him down from the tree, they put him in a tomb.
44.13.30.1^- but god raised him out from the dead,
44.13.31.1^who appeared for days many to those having come up with him from - galilee to jerusalem, who now are witnesses of him to the people.
44.13.32.1^and we to you preach the gospel, the to the fathers promise having been made,
44.13.33.1^that this - god has fulfilled, to the children of them, to us, having raised up jesus, as also in the psalm it has been written, the second:
44.13.33.2^son of me are you, i today have begotten you.
44.13.34.1^that then he raised him out from the dead, no more being about to return to decay, thus he spoke -:
44.13.34.2^i will give to you the holy blessings of david, the sure blessings.
44.13.35.1^therefore also in another he says:
44.13.35.2^not you will allow the holy one of you to see decay.
44.13.36.1^david indeed for in his own generation having served the - of god purpose, fell asleep and was added to the fathers of him, and saw decay.
44.13.37.1^the one however - god raised up not did see decay.
44.13.38.1^known therefore be it to you, men, brothers, that through this one, to you forgiveness of sins is proclaimed.
44.13.38.2^and from all things from which not you were able in the law of moses to be justified,
44.13.39.1^in him everyone - believing is justified.
44.13.40.1^take heed therefore, lest might come about that having been said in the prophets:
44.13.41.1^behold, - scoffers, and wonder and perish;
44.13.41.2^for a work am working i in the days of you, a work that never not you would believe, even if one should declare it to you.
44.13.42.1^having departed then, they were begging on the next sabbath to be spoken to them the words these.
44.13.43.1^having broken up then the synagogue, followed many of the jews and of the worshipping converts - paul and - barnabas, who speaking to them kept persuading them to continue in the grace - of god.
44.13.44.1^on the now coming sabbath, almost all the city was gathered together to hear the word - of the lord.
44.13.45.1^having seen however the jews the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began contradicting the things by paul spoken, blaspheming.
44.13.46.1^having spoken boldly also, - paul and - barnabas said, to you it was necessary first to be spoken the word - of god;
44.13.46.2^but since you thrust away it and not worthy you judge yourselves - of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the gentiles.
44.13.47.1^thus for has commanded us the lord:
44.13.47.2^i have set you for a light of the gentiles, - to be you for salvation to the uttermost part of the earth.
44.13.48.1^hearing it then, the gentiles were rejoicing and glorifying the word of the lord, and believed as many as were appointed to life eternal.
44.13.49.1^was carried then the word of the lord through all the region.
44.13.50.1^the but jews incited the worshipping women - of honorable position, and the principals of the city, and they stirred up a persecution against - paul and barnabas, and expelled them from the district of them.
44.13.51.1^- but having shaken off the dust of the feet against them, they went to iconium;
44.13.52.1^- and the disciples were filled with joy and the spirit holy.
44.14.1.1^it came to pass now in iconium, according to the same entered they into the synagogue of the jews and spoke so that believed of jewish both and greeks a great number.
44.14.2.1^the however unbelieving jews stirred up and poisoned the minds of the gentiles against the brothers.
44.14.3.1^a long indeed therefore time they stayed, speaking boldly for the lord, the one bearing witness to the word of the grace of him, granting signs and wonders to be done through the hands of them.
44.14.4.1^was divided now the multitude of the city, and some indeed were with the jews;
44.14.4.2^some however with the apostles.
44.14.5.1^when then there was a rush of the gentiles both and jews, with the rulers of them, to mistreat and to stone them,
44.14.6.1^having become aware, they fled to the cities - of lycaonia, lystra, and derbe, and the surrounding region,
44.14.7.1^and there preaching the gospel they continued.
44.14.8.1^and a certain man crippled, in lystra, in the feet, was sitting, lame from the womb of the mother of him, who never had walked.
44.14.9.1^this man heard - paul speaking, who, having looked intently at him and having seen that he has faith - to be healed,
44.14.10.1^said in a loud voice, stand on the feet of you upright!
44.14.10.2^and he sprang up and began to walk.
44.14.11.1^- and the crowds having seen what had done paul, lifted up the voice of them in lycaonian, saying, the gods, having become like men, have come down to us.
44.14.12.1^they began calling then - barnabas zeus, - and paul hermes, because he was the leading - speaker.
44.14.13.1^- and the priest - of zeus, - being just outside the city, oxen and wreaths to the gates having brought, with the crowds was desiring to sacrifice.
44.14.14.1^having heard however, the apostles barnabas and paul, having torn the garments of them, rushed out into the crowd, crying out
44.14.15.1^and saying, men, why these things do you?
44.14.15.2^also we of like nature are with you men, proclaiming the gospel to you, from these - vanities to turn to god the living, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them,
44.14.16.1^who in the past generations allowed all the nations to go the ways of them.
44.14.17.1^and yet not without witness himself he has left, doing good, from heaven to you rains giving and seasons fruitful, filling with food and gladness the hearts of you.
44.14.18.1^and these things saying, hardly they stopped the crowds - not sacrificing to them.
44.14.19.1^came however from antioch and iconium jews, and having persuaded the crowds, and having stoned - paul, they dragged him outside the city, supposing him to have died.
44.14.20.1^having surrounded however the disciples him, having risen up, he entered into the city.
44.14.20.2^and on the next day he went away with - barnabas to derbe.
44.14.21.1^having proclaimed the gospel to then the city that, and having discipled many, they returned to - lystra, and to iconium, and to antioch,
44.14.22.1^strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many tribulations it behooves us to enter into the kingdom - of god.
44.14.23.1^having chosen now for them in every church elders, having prayed, with fasting they committed them to the lord, in whom they had believed.
44.14.24.1^and having passed through - pisidia, they came to - pamphylia,
44.14.25.1^and having spoken in perga the word, they went down to attalia.
44.14.26.1^and from there they sailed to antioch, from where they had been committed to the grace - of god for the work that they had fulfilled.
44.14.27.1^having arrived now and having gathered together the church, they began declaring all that had done - god with them, and that he had opened to the gentiles a door of faith.
44.14.28.1^they remained then time no little with the disciples.
44.15.1.1^and certain ones having come down from - judea were teaching the brothers -, if not you are circumcised according to the custom - of moses, not you are able to be saved.
44.15.2.1^having been brought about then commotion and discussion no small - by paul and - barnabas with them, they appointed to go up paul and barnabas and certain others out from them, to the apostles and elders, to jerusalem, about the question this.
44.15.3.1^they indeed therefore having been sent forward by the church were passing through - both phoenicia and samaria, relating in detail the conversion of the gentiles, and they were bringing joy great to all the brothers.
44.15.4.1^having come then to jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders.
44.15.4.2^they declared then all that - god had done with them.
44.15.5.1^rose up now certain of those of the sect of the pharisees who believed, saying -, it is necessary to circumcise them, to command them then to keep the law of moses.
44.15.6.1^were gathered together then the apostles and the elders to see about the matter this.
44.15.7.1^of much now discussion having taken place, having risen up, peter said to them, men, brothers, you know that from days early, among you chose - god by the mouth of me to hear the gentiles the word of the gospel, and to believe.
44.15.8.1^and the heart-knowing god bore witness to them, having given them the spirit - holy, as also to us,
44.15.9.1^and not one he made distinction between us also and them, by the faith having purified the hearts of them.
44.15.10.1^now therefore, why are you testing - god, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples that neither the fathers of us, nor we, have been able to bear?
44.15.11.1^but by the grace of the lord jesus, we believe to be saved, in the same manner as they also.
44.15.12.1^kept silent now all the multitude, and were listening to barnabas and paul relating what had done - god, signs and wonders, among the gentiles by them.
44.15.13.1^after now - were silent they, answered james, saying, men, brothers, hear me.
44.15.14.1^simeon has related how first - god visited, to take out of the gentiles a people for the name of him.
44.15.15.1^and with this agree the words of the prophets, as it is written:
44.15.16.1^after these things i will return and will rebuild the tabernacle of david which has fallen, and the ruins of it i will rebuild, and i will set upright it,
44.15.17.1^so that - may seek out the remnant - of men the lord, and all the gentiles, upon whom has been called the name of me upon them, says the lord, doing these things,
44.15.18.1^known from eternity.
44.15.19.1^therefore i judge not to trouble those who, from the gentiles, are turning to - god,
44.15.20.1^but to write to them - to abstain from the pollutions of the idols, and - sexual immorality, and that which is strangled, and from blood.
44.15.21.1^moses for from generations of old, in every city ones proclaiming him has, in the synagogues on every sabbath being read.
44.15.22.1^then it seemed good to the apostles and to the elders, with all the church, having chosen men out from them, to send to antioch with - paul and barnabas:
44.15.22.2^judas - called barsabbas, and silas, men leading among the brothers,
44.15.23.1^having written by the hand of them:
44.15.23.2^the apostles and the elders, brothers, to those in - antioch and syria and cilicia, brothers - among the gentiles:
44.15.23.3^greetings.
44.15.24.1^inasmuch as we have heard that some from us went out troubled you by words, upsetting the minds of you, to whom not we had given instructions,
44.15.25.1^it seemed good to us having come with one accord, having chosen men, to send to you, with the beloved of us, barnabas and paul,
44.15.26.1^men having handed over the lives of them for the name of the lord of us, jesus christ.
44.15.27.1^we have sent therefore judas and silas, and they by word of mouth are telling you the same things.
44.15.28.1^it seemed good for to the spirit - holy and to us, no further to lay upon you burden, except these - necessary things:
44.15.29.1^to abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from sexual immorality.
44.15.29.2^from these keeping yourselves, well you will do.
44.15.29.3^farewell.
44.15.30.1^they indeed therefore, having been sent off, went to antioch, and having gathered the multitude, they delivered the letter.
44.15.31.1^having read it now, they rejoiced at the encouragement.
44.15.32.1^judas both and silas, also themselves prophets being, by talk much exhorted the brothers and strengthened them.
44.15.33.1^having continued then a time, they were sent away in peace from the brothers to those having sent them.
44.15.35.1^paul however and barnabas stayed in antioch, teaching and proclaiming the good news, with also others many, the word of the lord.
44.15.36.1^after now some days, said to barnabas, paul, having turned back indeed let us look after the brothers in city every in which we have announced the word of the lord, how they are.
44.15.37.1^barnabas now purposed to take along also - john - called mark;
44.15.38.1^paul however thought fit, the one having withdrawn from them from pamphylia and not having gone with them to the work, not to take along him.
44.15.39.1^arose therefore a sharp disagreement, so that separated they from one another;
44.15.39.2^- and barnabas, having taken - mark, sailed to cyprus.
44.15.40.1^paul however, having chosen silas, went forth, having been committed to the grace of the lord by the brothers.
44.15.41.1^he was passing through then - syria and - cilicia, strengthening the churches.
44.16.1.1^he came then also to derbe and to lystra.
44.16.1.2^and behold, a disciple certain was there, named timothy, the son of a woman jewish believing, father however a greek,
44.16.2.1^who was well spoken of by the in lystra and iconium brothers.
44.16.3.1^this one wanted - paul with him to go forth, and having taken, he circumcised him on account of the jews - being in the parts those;
44.16.3.2^they knew for all that a greek the father of him was.
44.16.4.1^while then they were passing through the cities, they were delivering to them to keep the decrees - decided on by the apostles and elders who were in jerusalem.
44.16.5.1^the indeed therefore churches were strengthened in the faith, and were increasing - in number every day.
44.16.6.1^having passed through then - phrygia and the galatian region, having been forbidden by the holy spirit to speak the word in - asia,
44.16.7.1^having come then down to - mysia, they were attempting into - bithynia to go;
44.16.7.2^and not did allow them the spirit of jesus;
44.16.8.1^having passed by then - mysia, they came down to troas.
44.16.9.1^and a vision during the night - to paul appeared:
44.16.9.2^a man of macedonia certain was standing and beseeching him and saying, having passed over into macedonia, help us.
44.16.10.1^when now the vision he had seen, immediately we sought to go forth to macedonia, concluding that had called us - god to preach the gospel to them.
44.16.11.1^having sailed then from troas, we made a straight course to samothrace, - and the following day, to nea polis,
44.16.12.1^and from there to philippi, which is the leading district of the of macedonia city, a colony.
44.16.12.2^we were now in this - city staying days some.
44.16.13.1^on the then day of the sabbaths, we went forth outside the city gate, by a river, where was customary a place of prayer to be.
44.16.13.2^and having sat down, we began speaking to the having gathered women.
44.16.14.1^and a certain woman named lydia, a seller of purple of the city of thyatira, worshiping - god, was listening, of whom the lord opened the heart to attend to the things being spoken by - paul.
44.16.15.1^when then she was baptized, and the house of her, she begged, saying, if you have judged me faithful to the lord to be, having entered into the house of me, abide.
44.16.15.2^and she persuaded us.
44.16.16.1^it happened now, going of us to the place of prayer, a girl certain, having a spirit of python, met us, who gain much was bringing the masters of her by fortune-telling.
44.16.17.1^she, having followed - paul and us, was crying out, saying, these - men servants of the god - most high are, who proclaim to you the way of salvation.
44.16.18.1^this then she continued for many days.
44.16.18.2^having been distressed then paul, and having turned to the spirit, he said, i command you in the name of jesus christ to come out from her.
44.16.18.3^and it came out the same - hour.
44.16.19.1^having seen now the masters of her that was gone the hope of the profit of them, having taken hold of - paul and - silas, they dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers;
44.16.20.1^and having brought up them to the magistrates, they said, these - men exceedingly trouble of us the city, jews being,
44.16.21.1^and preach customs, that not it is lawful for us to accept nor to practice, romans being.
44.16.22.1^and rose up together the crowd against them, and the magistrates having torn off of them the garments, were commanding that they be beaten with rods.
44.16.23.1^many then having laid on them blows, they cast them into prison, having charged the jailer securely to keep them,
44.16.24.1^who an order such having received, threw them into the inner prison, and the feet fastened of them in the stocks.
44.16.25.1^toward now - midnight, paul and silas, praying, were singing praises to - god.
44.16.25.2^were listening now to them the prisoners.
44.16.26.1^suddenly then earthquake there was a great, so that were shaken the foundations of the prison house;
44.16.26.2^were opened then immediately the doors all, and of all, the chains were loosed.
44.16.27.1^awoken then having been the jailer, and having seen open the doors of the prison, having drawn his sword, he was about himself to kill, supposing to have escaped the prisoners.
44.16.28.1^called out however loud in a voice, - paul saying, not do to yourself harm;
44.16.28.2^all for we are here.
44.16.29.1^having called for now lights, he rushed in, and terrified having become, he fell down before - paul and - silas.
44.16.30.1^and having brought them out he was saying, sirs, what of me is necessary to do, that i may be saved?
44.16.31.1^- and they said, believe on the lord jesus, and you will be saved, you and the household of you.
44.16.32.1^and they spoke to him the word of the lord, along with all those in the house of him.
44.16.33.1^and having taken them in that - hour of the night, he washed them from the wounds;
44.16.33.2^and he was baptized, he and the household of him all immediately.
44.16.34.1^having brought then them into the house, he laid a table for them, and rejoiced with all his household, having believed - in god.
44.16.35.1^day then having come, sent the magistrates the officers, saying, release the men those.
44.16.36.1^reported then the jailer the words these to - paul -:
44.16.36.2^have sent the captains, that you may be let go.
44.16.36.3^now therefore having gone out, depart in peace.
44.16.37.1^- but paul was saying to them, having beaten us publicly, uncondemned men, romans being, they cast us into prison, and now secretly us do they throw out?
44.16.37.2^no indeed!
44.16.37.3^instead, having come themselves, us let them bring out.
44.16.38.1^reported then to the captains the officers the words these.
44.16.38.2^they were afraid then, having heard that romans they are.
44.16.39.1^and having come, they appealed to them, and having brought them out, they were asking them to go out of the city.
44.16.40.1^having gone forth then out of the prison, they came to - lydia;
44.16.40.2^and having seen them, they exhorted the brothers and departed.
44.17.1.1^having passed through then - amphipolis and - apollonia, they came to thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the jews.
44.17.2.1^according to now the custom - with paul, he went in to them, and for sabbaths three he reasoned with them from the scriptures,
44.17.3.1^opening and setting forth that the christ it behooved to have suffered, and to have risen out from the dead, and that this is the christ - jesus, whom i preach to you.
44.17.4.1^and some of them were obedient and joined themselves - to paul and - to silas, - along with worshipping greeks a multitude great, women then of the leading not a few.
44.17.5.1^having become jealous now the jews, and having taken to them of the market-loungers men certain wicked, and having collected a crowd, they set in uproar the city;
44.17.5.2^and having assailed the house of jason, they were seeking them to bring out to the people.
44.17.6.1^not having found however them, they dragged jason and certain brothers before the city authorities, crying out -, the ones the world having upset, these also here are come,
44.17.7.1^whom has received jason.
44.17.7.2^and these all, contrary to the decrees of caesar do, king another proclaiming to be:
44.17.7.3^jesus.
44.17.8.1^they stirred up then the crowd, and the city authorities, hearing these things.
44.17.9.1^and having taken - security from - jason and the rest, they let go them.
44.17.10.1^- and the brothers immediately by night sent away - both paul and - silas to berea, who having arrived, into the synagogue of the jews went.
44.17.11.1^these now were more noble than those in thessalonica, who received the word with all readiness, every day examining the scriptures if were these things so.
44.17.12.1^many indeed therefore of them believed, and of the grecian women - prominent and men not a few.
44.17.13.1^when however knew those from - thessalonica jews that also in - berea was proclaimed by - paul the word - of god, they came there also, stirring up and agitating the crowds.
44.17.14.1^immediately also then, - paul sent away the brothers to go as to the sea;
44.17.14.2^remained but - both silas and - timothy there.
44.17.15.1^those now escorting - paul brought him unto athens;
44.17.15.2^and having received a command unto - silas and - timothy that as quickly as possible they should come to him, they departed.
44.17.16.1^in now - athens, waiting for them - of paul, was provoked the spirit of him in him, seeing utterly idolatrous to be the city.
44.17.17.1^he was reasoning indeed therefore in the synagogue with the jews and those worshiping, and in the marketplace on every day with those meeting him.
44.17.18.1^some then also of the epicureans and stoics, philosophers, encountered him.
44.17.18.2^and some were saying, what - may desire of the babbler this to say?
44.17.18.3^others however, of foreign gods he seems a proclaimer to be, because - jesus and the resurrection he was proclaiming the gospel of.
44.17.19.1^having taken hold also of him, to the ares hill they brought him, saying, are we able to know what is the new this, which by you is spoken, teaching?
44.17.20.1^strange things for some you are bringing to the ears of us.
44.17.20.2^we resolve therefore to know what wish these things to be.
44.17.21.1^the athenians now all, and the visiting strangers, in nothing else spent their time than to tell something and to hear something new.
44.17.22.1^having stood then - paul in the midst of the ares hill, he was saying, men, athenians, in all things as very religious you i behold.
44.17.23.1^passing through for and beholding the objects of worship of you, i found even an altar on which had been inscribed:
44.17.23.2^to an unknown god.
44.17.23.3^whom therefore not knowing you worship, him i proclaim to you.
44.17.24.1^the god - having made the world and all things that are in it, he of heaven and earth being lord, not in hand-made temples dwells,
44.17.25.1^nor by hands of men is he served, as needing anything, himself giving to all life and breath, and the all;
44.17.26.1^he made then of one, every nation of men, to dwell upon all the face of the earth, having determined the appointed times and the boundaries of the habitation of them,
44.17.27.1^to seek - god, if perhaps indeed they might palpate for him, and might find him.
44.17.27.2^and indeed, not far from one each of us he is.
44.17.28.1^in him for we live and move and are.
44.17.28.2^as also some of the among you poets have said, of him for also offspring we are.
44.17.29.1^offspring therefore being - of god, not we ought to consider to gold, or to silver, or to stone, a graven thing, of craft and imagination of man, the divine being to be like.
44.17.30.1^the indeed therefore times - of ignorance having overlooked - god, - now he commands - men all everywhere to repent,
44.17.31.1^because he set a day in which he is about to judge the world in righteousness, by a man whom he appointed, a guarantee having provided to all, having raised him out from the dead.
44.17.32.1^having heard of now a resurrection of the dead, some indeed began to mock him;
44.17.32.2^some however said, we will hear you concerning this also again.
44.17.33.1^thus - paul went out from the midst of them.
44.17.34.1^some however men, having joined themselves to him, believed, among whom also were dionysius the areopagite, and a woman named damaris, and others with them.
44.18.1.1^and after these things, having departed from - athens, he came to corinth.
44.18.2.1^and having found a certain jew named aquila, of pontus - a native, recently having come from - italy, and priscilla wife of him, because of - having commanded claudius to depart all the jews out of - rome, he came to them,
44.18.3.1^and due to of the same trade being, he stayed with them and worked;
44.18.3.2^they were for tentmakers by the trade.
44.18.4.1^he was reasoning now in the synagogue on every sabbath, persuading both jews and greeks.
44.18.5.1^when now came down from - macedonia - both silas and - timothy, was occupied with the word - paul, earnestly testifying to the jews to be the christ jesus.
44.18.6.1^opposing however of them and reviling him, having shaken out the garments, he said to them, the blood of you be upon the head of you;
44.18.6.2^clean i am.
44.18.6.3^from - now on, to the gentiles i will go.
44.18.7.1^and having departed from there he came to the house of a certain one named titius justus, worshiping - god, of whom the house was adjoining the synagogue.
44.18.8.1^crispus now, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the lord, with all the household of him.
44.18.8.2^and many of the corinthians hearing, believed and were baptized.
44.18.9.1^said now the lord in the night through a vision - to paul, not fear, but continue speaking, and not be silent,
44.18.10.1^because i am with you, and no one will lay a hand on you - to harm you, because people there are to me many in the city this.
44.18.11.1^he remained now a year and months six, teaching among them the word - of god.
44.18.12.1^gallio however proconsul being of achaia, rose up against with one accord the jews - paul, and led him to the judgment seat,
44.18.13.1^saying -, contrary to the law, persuades this man - men to worship - god.
44.18.14.1^being about now - paul to open the mouth, said - gallio to the jews, if indeed it was unrighteousness some or crime wicked, o jews, according to reason - i would have endured with you;
44.18.15.1^if however a question it is about a word, and names, and law - in reference to your, you will see to it yourselves;
44.18.15.2^a judge i of these things not resolve to be.
44.18.16.1^and he drove them from the judgment seat.
44.18.17.1^having seized then all of them sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, they began to beat him before the judgment seat.
44.18.17.2^and nothing about these things - to gallio it mattered.
44.18.18.1^- now paul, more having remained days many, the brothers having taken leave of, sailed away to - syria   and with him priscilla and aquila   having shaved in cenchrea the head;
44.18.18.2^he had for a vow.
44.18.19.1^they came now to ephesus, and them left there.
44.18.19.2^he himself then having entered into the synagogue, he reasoned with the jews.
44.18.20.1^asking him now of them for a longer time to remain, not he did consent,
44.18.21.1^but having taken leave and having said, again i will return to you, - god willing, he sailed from - ephesus,
44.18.22.1^and having landed at caesarea, having gone up and having greeted the church, he went down to antioch.
44.18.23.1^and having stayed time some, he went forth, passing through successively the galatian region and phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.
44.18.24.1^a jew now certain, apollos named, of alexandria - a native, a man eloquent, came to ephesus, mighty being in the scriptures.
44.18.25.1^he was instructed in the way of the lord.
44.18.25.2^and being fervent - in spirit, he was speaking and was teaching earnestly the things concerning - jesus, knowing only the baptism of john.
44.18.26.1^he then began to speak boldly in the synagogue.
44.18.26.2^having heard however him priscilla and aquila, they took to them him and more accurately to him expounded the way of god.
44.18.27.1^resolving then he to pass through into - achaia, having encouraged him, the brothers wrote to the disciples to welcome him, who having arrived, helped greatly those having believed through - grace.
44.18.28.1^powerfully for the jews he was refuting publicly, showing by the scriptures to be the christ jesus.
44.19.1.1^it came to pass now, while - - apollos was in corinth, paul having passed through the upper parts to come down to ephesus, and having found certain disciples,
44.19.2.1^he said also to them, if the spirit holy did you receive, having believed?
44.19.2.2^- and they said to him, but not even that a spirit holy there is, did we hear.
44.19.3.1^he said then, into what then were you baptized?
44.19.3.2^- and they said, into - john s baptism.
44.19.4.1^said then paul, john baptized a baptism of repentance, the people telling in the one coming after him that they should believe, that is, in - jesus.
44.19.5.1^having heard then, they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus.
44.19.6.1^and having laid on them - paul the hands, came the spirit - holy upon them;
44.19.6.2^they were speaking then in tongues and prophesying.
44.19.7.1^there were then the in all men about twelve.
44.19.8.1^having entered then into the synagogue, he was speaking boldly for months three, reasoning and persuading - concerning the kingdom - of god.
44.19.9.1^when however some were hardened and were disbelieving, speaking evil of the way before the multitude, having departed from them, he took separately the disciples, every day reasoning in the lecture hall of tyrannus.
44.19.10.1^this then continued for years two, so that all those inhabiting - asia heard the word of the lord, jews both and greeks.
44.19.11.1^miracles then not - being ordinary, - god was performing by the hands of paul,
44.19.12.1^so that even to the ailing were brought from the skin of him handkerchiefs or aprons, and departed from them the diseases, the also spirits - evil left.
44.19.13.1^attempted now some of also of the itinerant jews, exorcists, to invoke over those having - spirits - evil the name of the lord jesus, saying, i adjure you by jesus whom paul proclaims.
44.19.14.1^they were now certain of sceva, a jew, a high priest, seven sons, this were doing.
44.19.15.1^answering however, the spirit - evil said to them -, - jesus i know, and - paul i am acquainted with;
44.19.15.2^you however, who are you?
44.19.16.1^and having leapt the man on them in whom was the spirit - evil, having overpowered them all, he prevailed against them so that naked and wounded they fled out of the house that.
44.19.17.1^this now became known to all jews both and greeks, those inhabiting - ephesus;
44.19.17.2^and fell fear upon all them, and was being magnified the name of the lord jesus.
44.19.18.1^many then of those having believed were coming, confessing and declaring the deeds of them.
44.19.19.1^many now of those the magic arts having practiced, having brought the books, burned them before all.
44.19.19.2^and they counted up the prices of them and found it of silverlings myriads five.
44.19.20.1^thus with might of the lord the word continued to increase and prevail.
44.19.21.1^after now were fulfilled these things, purposed - paul in the spirit, having passed through - macedonia and achaia, to go to jerusalem, having said -, after - having been my there, it behooves me also rome to see.
44.19.22.1^having sent then into - macedonia two of those ministering to him, timothy and erastus, he remained for a time in - asia.
44.19.23.1^arose now at the time same a disturbance not small concerning the way.
44.19.24.1^demetrius for a certain man named, a silversmith, making shrines silver of artemis, was bringing to the craftsmen no little business,
44.19.25.1^whom having brought together, also the in such things workmen, he said, men, you know that from this - business the wealth of us is.
44.19.26.1^and you see and hear that not only in ephesus, but almost all - of asia, - paul, this having persuaded them, has turned away a great many people, saying that not they are gods - by hands being made.
44.19.27.1^not only but this is endangered to us, the business into disrepute to come, but also the of the great goddess artemis temple for nothing to be reckoned, to be and also deposed the majesty of her, whom all - asia and the world worship.
44.19.28.1^having heard then and having become full of rage, they were crying out, saying, great is - artemis of the ephesians.
44.19.29.1^and was filled the city whole with confusion;
44.19.29.2^they rushed and with one accord to the theatre, having dragged off gaius and aristarchus, macedonians, fellow travelers of paul.
44.19.30.1^of paul however intending to go in to the people, not would allow him the disciples.
44.19.31.1^some then also of the asiarchs, being to him friends, having sent to him, were urging him not to venture himself into the theatre.
44.19.32.1^others indeed therefore some thing were crying out;
44.19.32.2^was for the assembly confused, and - most not did know for what cause they were assembled.
44.19.33.1^out of now the crowd to explain himself alexander, having thrust forward him the jews.
44.19.33.2^- and alexander, having motioned with the hand, was wanting to make a defense to the people.
44.19.34.1^having recognized however that a jew he is, a cry there was one from all, about ongoing hours two crying out, great is - artemis of the ephesians.
44.19.35.1^having calmed then the town clerk the crowd, he says, men, ephesians, what for is there man who not knows the of the ephesians city temple-keeper as being of the great artemis, and of that fallen from the sky?
44.19.36.1^undeniable therefore being these things, necessary it is for you calm to be, and nothing rash to do.
44.19.37.1^you brought for the men these, neither temple plunderers nor blaspheming the goddess of us.
44.19.38.1^if indeed therefore demetrius and the with him craftsmen have against anyone a matter, courts are conducted, and proconsuls there are;
44.19.38.2^let them accuse one another.
44.19.39.1^if however anything beyond this you inquire, in the lawful assembly it will be solved.
44.19.40.1^and for we are in danger of being accused of insurrection in regard to - this day, not one cause there existing concerning which not we will be able to give a reason for the commotion this.
44.19.40.2^and these things having said, he dismissed the assembly.
44.20.1.1^after now - had ceased the uproar, having called to him - paul the disciples and having encouraged, having said farewell, he departed to go to macedonia.
44.20.2.1^having passed through then the districts those, and having exhorted them with talk much, he came to - greece.
44.20.3.1^having continued then months three, having been made a plot against him by the jews, he being about to sail into - syria, arose a purpose - to return through macedonia.
44.20.4.1^was accompanied by then he sopater pyrrhus, a berean;
44.20.4.2^of the thessalonians now, aristarchus and secundus;
44.20.4.3^and gaius of derbe and timothy;
44.20.4.4^the asians now, tychicus and trophimus.
44.20.5.1^these also having gone ahead, waited for us in troas.
44.20.6.1^we then sailed away after the days of the unleavened bread, from philippi, and we came to them at - troas within days five, where we stayed days seven.
44.20.7.1^in then the first day of the week, having come together we to break bread, - paul talked to them, about to depart on the next day;
44.20.7.2^he continued then the talk until midnight.
44.20.8.1^there were now lamps many in the upper room where we were assembled.
44.20.9.1^was sitting then a certain young man named eutychus by the window, overpowered by sleep deep as talked - paul on longer;
44.20.9.2^having been overpowered by the sleep, he fell from the third story down, and was picked up dead.
44.20.10.1^having descended however, - paul fell upon him, and having embraced him, said, not be alarmed, the for life of him in him is.
44.20.11.1^having gone up then, and having broken the bread, and having eaten, for long and having talked until daybreak, so he departed.
44.20.12.1^they brought then the boy alive, and were comforted not a little.
44.20.13.1^we however, having gone ahead to the ship, sailed to - assos, there being about to take in - paul.
44.20.13.2^thus for having arranged, he was readying himself to go on foot.
44.20.14.1^when now he met with us at - assos, having taken in him, we came to mitylene.
44.20.15.1^and from there having sailed away, on the following day we arrived opposite chios;
44.20.15.2^- then the next day we arrived at samos;
44.20.15.3^the now following day we came to miletus.
44.20.16.1^had decided for - paul to sail by - ephesus, so that not it might come upon to him to spend time in - asia;
44.20.16.2^he was hastened for, if possible it was for him, on the day - of pentecost to be in jerusalem.
44.20.17.1^from then - miletus, having sent to ephesus, he called for the elders of the church.
44.20.18.1^when then they had come to him, he said to them, you know from the first day on which i arrived in - asia, how with you the whole time i was,
44.20.19.1^serving the lord with all humility, and tears, and trials - having befallen me in the plots of the jews;
44.20.20.1^how nothing i did shrink back of that being profitable, - not to declare to you, and to teach you publicly and from house to house,
44.20.21.1^earnestly testifying to the jewish both and to greeks, - in god repentance and faith in the lord of us, jesus.
44.20.22.1^and now, behold, bound i in the spirit go to jerusalem, what in it will happen to me not knowing,
44.20.23.1^except that the spirit - holy in every city fully testifies to me, saying that chains and tribulations me await.
44.20.24.1^but not any account i make my life dear to myself, so as to finish the course of me, and the ministry that i received from the lord jesus, to testify fully the gospel of the grace - of god.
44.20.25.1^and now, behold, i know that no more you will see the face of me, you all among whom i have gone about proclaiming the kingdom.
44.20.26.1^therefore i testify to you in - this day, that innocent i am of the blood of all;
44.20.27.1^not for i shrunk back - not from declaring all the counsel - of god to you.
44.20.28.1^take heed to yourselves and to all the flock among which you the spirit - holy has set overseers, to shepherd the church - of god, which he purchased with - blood the own.
44.20.29.1^i know that will come in after the departure of me wolves grievous among you, not sparing the flock,
44.20.30.1^and out from your own selves will rise up men speaking perverse things, - to draw away - disciples after them.
44.20.31.1^therefore stay awake, remembering that three years, night and day, not i ceased with tears admonishing one each.
44.20.32.1^and - now i commit you to god and to the word of the grace of him, - being able to build up and to give you an inheritance among those having been sanctified all.
44.20.33.1^silver or gold or clothing of no one i coveted.
44.20.34.1^you yourselves know that the needs of me and to those being with me, ministered to the hands these.
44.20.35.1^in everything i showed you that by thus straining it behooves us to aid those being weak, to remember and also the words of the lord jesus, how he himself said, blessed it is more to give than to receive.
44.20.36.1^and these things having said, having bowed the knee of him, with all them he prayed.
44.20.37.1^much then weeping there was among all;
44.20.37.2^and having fallen upon the neck - of paul, they were kissing him,
44.20.38.1^sorrowing especially over the word that he had spoken, that no more they are about the face of him to see.
44.20.38.2^they accompanied then him to the ship.
44.21.1.1^after then it happened sailing our, having drawn away from them, having run directly we came to - cos, - and the next day to - rhodes, and from there to patara.
44.21.2.1^and having found a boat passing over into phoenicia, having gone on board, we set sail.
44.21.3.1^having sighted then - cyprus and having left it on the left, we kept sailing to syria and landed at tyre.
44.21.3.2^there for the ship was unloading the cargo.
44.21.4.1^having sought out then the disciples, we remained there days seven, who - to paul kept telling through the spirit not to go up to jerusalem.
44.21.5.1^when then it happened that we had completed the days, having set out, we journeyed, accompanying us all with wives and children, as far as outside the city.
44.21.5.2^and having bowed the knees on the shore, having prayed,
44.21.6.1^having said farewell to one another, then we went up into the boat;
44.21.6.2^they then returned to the own.
44.21.7.1^we then, the voyage having completed from tyre, came down to ptolemais, and having greeted the brothers, we stayed day one with them.
44.21.8.1^on the now next day, having gone forth, we came to caesarea;
44.21.8.2^and having entered into the house of philip the evangelist, being of the seven, we stayed with him.
44.21.9.1^with this man now there were daughters four, virgins, prophesying.
44.21.10.1^remaining now days many, came down a certain one from - judea, a prophet named agabus;
44.21.11.1^and having come to us, and having taken the belt - of paul, having bound of himself the feet and the hands, he said, thus says the spirit - holy, the man of whom is the belt this, in this way will bind in jerusalem the jews and will deliver him into the hands of the gentiles.
44.21.12.1^when then we had heard these things, began begging we both and those of that place, - not to go up him to jerusalem.
44.21.13.1^then answered - paul, what are you doing, weeping and breaking my - heart?
44.21.13.2^i for not only to be bound, but also to die at jerusalem, readiness have, for the name of the lord jesus.
44.21.14.1^not being persuaded then of him, we were silent, having said, of the lord the will be done.
44.21.15.1^after now the days these, having packed the baggage, we started on our way up to jerusalem.
44.21.16.1^went then also some of the disciples from caesarea with us, bringing one with whom we would lodge, mnason, a certain cypriot, an early disciple.
44.21.17.1^having arrived now we at jerusalem, gladly received us the brothers.
44.21.18.1^on the now following day, went in - paul with us unto james, all and arrived the elders.
44.21.19.1^and having greeted them, he began to relate, by one each, the things had done - god among the gentiles through the ministry of him.
44.21.20.1^those then having heard began glorifying - god.
44.21.20.2^they said then to him, you see, brother, how many myriads there are among the jews - having believed, and all zealous ones for the law are.
44.21.21.1^they have been informed now about you, that apostasy you teach, from moses, those among the gentiles all jews, telling not to circumcise them the children, nor in the customs to walk.
44.21.22.1^what then is it?
44.21.22.2^certainly they will hear that you have come.
44.21.23.1^this therefore do you what to you we say.
44.21.23.2^there are with us men four, a vow having on themselves.
44.21.24.1^these men having taken, be purified with them and bear expense for them, so that they will shave the head, and will know all that of which they have been informed about you nothing is, but you walk orderly also yourself, keeping the law.
44.21.25.1^concerning now those having believed of the gentiles, we wrote, having adjudged to keep from them, the things both sacrificed to idols, and blood, and what is strangled, and sexual immorality.
44.21.26.1^then - paul, having taken the men, on the following day, with them having been purified, entered into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of the purification until that was offered for one each of them the sacrifice.
44.21.27.1^when now were about the seven days to be completed, the from - asia jews, having seen him in the temple, began stirring up all the crowd and laid upon him the hands,
44.21.28.1^crying out, men, israelites, help!
44.21.28.2^this is the man who against the people and the law and the place this all those everywhere teaching;
44.21.28.3^besides and also greeks he has brought into the temple and defiled the holy place this.
44.21.29.1^it was they for having previously seen trophimus the ephesian in the city with him, whom they were supposing that into the temple had brought - paul.
44.21.30.1^was thrown into commotion also the city whole, and there was a rushing together of the people.
44.21.30.2^and having laid hold - of paul, they dragged him outside the temple, and immediately were shut the doors.
44.21.31.1^of them seeking then him to kill, there came a report to the commander of the cohort that all was in an uproar jerusalem,
44.21.32.1^who at once, having taken with him soldiers and centurions, ran down upon them.
44.21.32.2^- and having seen the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating - paul.
44.21.33.1^then having drawn near, the commander laid hold of him and commanded him to be bound with chains two, and began inquiring who he might be and what it is he has been doing.
44.21.34.1^others however, another or one thing were crying out in the crowd.
44.21.34.2^not being able now he to know the facts on account of the uproar, he ordered to be brought him into the barracks.
44.21.35.1^when now he came to the stairs, it happened that was carried he by the soldiers, because of the violence of the crowd.
44.21.36.1^were following for the multitude of the people, crying out, away with him.
44.21.37.1^being about then to be brought into the barracks, - paul says to the commander, if is it permitted to me to say something to you?
44.21.37.2^- then he was saying, greek do you know?
44.21.38.1^not then you are the egyptian - before these the days having led a revolt and having led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the assassins?
44.21.39.1^said however - paul, i a man indeed am a jew of tarsus, - of cilicia, not of an insignificant city a citizen.
44.21.39.2^i implore now you, allow me to speak to the people.
44.21.40.1^having allowed him then he, - paul, having stood on the stairs, made a sign with the hand to the people;
44.21.40.2^great then silence having taken place, he spoke to them in the hebrew language, saying:
44.22.1.1^men, brothers, and fathers, hear of me the to you now defense.
44.22.2.1^having heard then that in the hebrew language he was addressing them, even more they became quiet.
44.22.2.2^and he says,
44.22.3.1^i am a man, a jew, born in tarsus - of cilicia, brought up now in the city this at the feet of gamaliel, having been instructed according to the exactness of the of our fathers law, a zealous one being - for god, even as all you are this day;
44.22.4.1^who this - way persecuted as far as death, binding and betraying to prisons men both and women,
44.22.5.1^as also the high priest bears witness to me, and all the elderhood;
44.22.5.2^from whom also letters, having received to the brothers, to damascus i was on my way to bring also those there being, bound to jerusalem, in order that they might be punished.
44.22.6.1^it happened however to me journeying and drawing near - to damascus, about noon, suddenly out of - heaven shone a light great around me.
44.22.7.1^i fell then to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, saul, saul, why me persecute you?
44.22.8.1^i then answered, who are you, lord?
44.22.8.2^he said then to me, i am jesus of nazareth, whom you are persecuting.
44.22.9.1^those then with me being, the indeed light beheld;
44.22.9.2^the however voice not did they hear of the one speaking to me.
44.22.10.1^i said then, what shall i do, lord?
44.22.10.2^- and the lord said to me, having risen up go to damascus, and there you it will be told concerning all things that it has been appointed you to do.
44.22.11.1^while now, not i could see from the brightness of the light that, being led by the hand by those being with me, i came to damascus.
44.22.12.1^ananias then certain, a man devout according to the law, borne witness to by all the dwelling there jews,
44.22.13.1^having come to me and having stood by me, said to me, saul brother, receive your sight.
44.22.13.2^and i the same - hour looked up at him.
44.22.14.1^- and he said, the god of the fathers of us has appointed you to know the will of him, and to see the righteous one, and to hear the voice out of the mouth of him.
44.22.15.1^for you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard.
44.22.16.1^and now why delay you?
44.22.16.2^having arisen, be baptized and wash away the sins of you, calling on the name of him.
44.22.17.1^it happened then to me, having returned to jerusalem, and praying of my in the temple, fell i into a trance
44.22.18.1^and saw him saying to me, make haste and go away with speed out of jerusalem, because not they will receive your testimony about me.
44.22.19.1^and i said, lord, they themselves know that i was imprisoning and beating in each of those synagogues those believing on you.
44.22.20.1^and when was poured out the blood of stephen, the witness of you, also i myself was standing by, and consenting, and watching over the garments of those killing him.
44.22.21.1^and he said to me, go, for i to the gentiles far away will send you.
44.22.22.1^they were listening now to him until this - word, and they lifted up the voice of them, saying, away with from the earth, the such.
44.22.22.2^not for it is fit he to live!
44.22.23.1^were crying out then they, and casting off the garments, and dust throwing into the air.
44.22.24.1^ordered the commander to be brought him into the barracks, having directed by flogging to be examined him, so that he might know for what cause like this they were crying out against him.
44.22.25.1^as however he stretched forward him with the straps, said to the standing by centurion - paul, if a man, a roman and uncondemned, it is lawful to you to flog?
44.22.26.1^having heard then the centurion, having gone to the commander, he reported it, saying, what are you going to do?
44.22.26.2^the for man this a roman is.
44.22.27.1^having come near then, the commander said to him, tell me, you a roman are?
44.22.27.2^- and he was saying, yes.
44.22.28.1^answered then the commander, i with a great sum the citizenship this bought.
44.22.28.2^- but paul was saying, i however even was born so.
44.22.29.1^immediately therefore departed from him those being about him to examine, and the commander also was afraid, having ascertained that a roman he is, and because him he had bound.
44.22.30.1^on the now next day, desiring to know - for certain - why he is accused by the jews, he unbound him and commanded to assemble the chief priests and all the council.
44.22.30.2^and having brought down - paul, he set him among them.
44.23.1.1^having looked intently then - paul at the council, he said, men, brothers, i in all conscience good have lived as a citizen - to god unto this - day.
44.23.2.1^- then the high priest ananias commanded those standing by him to strike of him the mouth.
44.23.3.1^then - paul to him said, to strike you is about - god, wall whitewashed!
44.23.3.2^and you, do you sit judging me according to the law, and violating law, command me to be struck?
44.23.4.1^those who now stood by said, the high priest - of god do you insult?
44.23.5.1^was saying then - paul, not i was aware, brothers, that he is high priest;
44.23.5.2^it has been written for -:
44.23.5.3^the ruler of the people of you, not you shall speak evil of.
44.23.6.1^having known then - paul that the one part consists of sadducees, - but the other of pharisees, he began crying out in the council, men, brothers, i a pharisee am, the son of a pharisee;
44.23.6.2^concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead i am judged.
44.23.7.1^this then of him saying, arose a dissension between the pharisees and sadducees, and was divided the crowd.
44.23.8.1^sadducees indeed for say not there to be resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit;
44.23.8.2^pharisees however confess - both.
44.23.9.1^arose then a clamor great, and having risen up some of the scribes of the party of the pharisees, they were contending, saying, nothing evil we find in the man this.
44.23.9.2^what if now a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel?
44.23.10.1^great then arising dissension, having feared the commander, lest should be torn to pieces - paul by them, he commanded the troop, having gone down, to take by force him from midst of them, to bring him then into the barracks.
44.23.11.1^- but the following night, having stood by him, the lord said, take courage, as for you have fully testified - about me at jerusalem, so you it behooves also in rome to testify.
44.23.12.1^when it was then day, having made a conspiracy, the jews put under an oath themselves, declaring neither to eat nor to drink until that they should kill - paul.
44.23.13.1^there were now more than forty, - this - plot having made,
44.23.14.1^who, having come to the chief priests and the elders, said, with an oath we have bound ourselves, nothing to eat until that we should kill - paul.
44.23.15.1^now therefore you, make a report to the commander along with the council, so that he might bring down him to you, as being about to examine more earnestly the things about him;
44.23.15.2^we then, before - drawing near his, ready are - to kill him.
44.23.16.1^having heard however the son of the sister of paul of the ambush, having come near and having entered into the barracks, he reported it - to paul.
44.23.17.1^having called to him then - paul one of the centurions, he was saying, the young man this take to the commander;
44.23.17.2^he has for to report something to him.
44.23.18.1^the one indeed therefore having taken him brought him to the commander, and he says, the prisoner paul, having called to me, asked me this - young man to lead to you, having something to say to you.
44.23.19.1^having taken hold then the hand of him the commander, and having withdrawn in private, he began to inquire, what is it that you have to report to me?
44.23.20.1^he said then -, the jews have agreed - to ask you that tomorrow - paul you might bring down into the council, as being about something more earnestly to inquire about him.
44.23.21.1^you therefore not should be persuaded by them.
44.23.21.2^lie in wait indeed for him of them men more than forty, who have put under an oath themselves neither to eat nor to drink until that they have killed him;
44.23.21.3^and now they are ready, awaiting the from you promise.
44.23.22.1^- indeed therefore the commander dismissed the young man, having instructed him, no one tell that these things you have reported to me.
44.23.23.1^and having called to him two certain of the centurions, he said, prepare soldiers two hundred, so that they might go as far as caesarea, and horsemen seventy, and spearmen two hundred, for the third hour of the night.
44.23.24.1^mounts then provide, so that having set upon them - paul, they might bring him safely to felix the governor,
44.23.25.1^having written a letter, having the form this:
44.23.26.1^claudius lysias, to the most excellent governor, felix:
44.23.26.2^greetings.
44.23.27.1^the man this, having been seized by the jews, and being about to be killed by them, having come up with the troop, i rescued him, having learned that a roman he is.
44.23.28.1^resolving then to know the charge on account of which they were accusing him, i brought him down to the council of them,
44.23.29.1^whom i found being accused concerning questions of the law of them, no however worthy of death or of chains having accusation.
44.23.30.1^it having been disclosed then to me of a plot that against the man would be, at once i sent him to you, having instructed also the accusers to speak these things against him before you.
44.23.31.1^- indeed therefore the soldiers, according to that having been ordered them, having taken - paul, brought him by night to - antipatris.
44.23.32.1^on the now next day, having allowed the horsemen to go with him, they returned to the barracks,
44.23.33.1^who having entered into - caesarea and having delivered the letter to the governor, presented also - paul to him.
44.23.34.1^having read it then, and having asked from what province he is, and having learned that from cilicia he is,
44.23.35.1^i will hear fully you, he was saying, when also the accusers of you may have arrived, having commanded in the praetorium - of herod to be guarded him.
44.24.1.1^after then five days, came down the high priest ananias, with elders some and an orator tertullus certain, who made a representation to the governor against - paul.
44.24.2.1^having been called then of him, began to accuse - tertullus, saying, great peace we are attaining through you, and excellent measures are being done to the nation this through - your foresight,
44.24.3.1^in every way both and everywhere, we gladly accept it, most excellent felix, with all thankfulness.
44.24.4.1^in order that however not to any longer you i should be a hindrance, i implore to hear you us briefly, in your kindness.
44.24.5.1^having found for the man this a pest, and stirring insurrection among all the jews - in the world, a leader then of the of the nazarenes sect,
44.24.6.1^who even the temple attempted to profane, whom also we seized.
44.24.8.1^from him you will be able yourself, having examined him concerning all these things, to know of which we accuse him.
44.24.9.1^agreed then also the jews, declaring these things so to be.
44.24.10.1^answered then - paul, having made a sign to him the governor to speak:
44.24.10.2^for many years, as being you judge to nation, this knowing, cheerfully to the things concerning myself i make a defense.
44.24.11.1^being able you to know that not more than there are to me days twelve, from which i went up to worship in jerusalem.
44.24.12.1^and neither in the temple did they find me with anyone reasoning, or a tumultuous gathering making of a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city.
44.24.13.1^nor to prove are they able to you, concerning the things of which now they accuse me.
44.24.14.1^i confess however this to you, that according to the way which they call a sect, so i serve the of our fathers god, believing all things - throughout the law, and that in the prophets have been written,
44.24.15.1^a hope having in - god which also they themselves await, that a resurrection there is about to be of the just both and of the unjust.
44.24.16.1^in this also i myself strive, without offense a conscience to have toward - god and - men, through everything.
44.24.17.1^after years now many, alms to bring to the nation of me, i arrived, and offerings,
44.24.18.1^during which they found me purified in the temple, not with a crowd, nor in tumult.
44.24.19.1^some however are from - asia, jews who ought before you to appear and to make accusation, if anything they may have against me.
44.24.20.1^otherwise themselves it let them say any they found unrighteousness, having stood in me before the council,
44.24.21.1^other than concerning one this voice which i cried out among them standing -:
44.24.21.2^concerning the resurrection of the dead i am judged this day by you.
44.24.22.1^put off however them - felix, more precisely having knowledge of the things concerning the way, having said, when lysias the commander might have come down, i will examine the things as to you,
44.24.23.1^having commanded the centurion to keep him, to let him have then ease, and not to forbid the own of him to minister to him.
44.24.24.1^after then days some, having arrived - felix with drusilla, the own wife, being a jewess, he sent for - paul and heard him concerning the in christ jesus faith.
44.24.25.1^reasoning then he concerning righteousness and self-control and the judgment - coming, frightened having become, - felix answered, for the present being go away;
44.24.25.2^opportunity then having found, i will call for you.
44.24.26.1^at the same time also, he is hoping that riches will be given him by - paul.
44.24.26.2^therefore also often him sending for, he was talking with him.
44.24.27.1^two years however having been completed, received as successor - felix, porcius festus;
44.24.27.2^wishing then favor to acquire for himself with the jews, - felix left - paul imprisoned.
44.25.1.1^festus therefore having arrived in the province, after three days he went up to jerusalem from caesarea.
44.25.2.1^made a presentation before then him the chief priests and the chiefs of the jews, against - paul, and they were begging him,
44.25.3.1^asking a favor against him, that he would summon him to jerusalem, an ambush forming to kill him on the way.
44.25.4.1^- indeed therefore festus answered that is to be kept - paul in caesarea;
44.25.4.2^he himself now is about in quickness to set out.
44.25.5.1^those therefore among you, he says, those in power, having gone down too, if anything there is in the man wrong, let them accuse him.
44.25.6.1^having spent then with them days not more than eight or ten, having gone down to caesarea, on the next day having sat on the judgment seat, he commanded - paul to be brought.
44.25.7.1^having arrived then he, stood around him the from jerusalem having come down jews, many and weighty charges bringing, which not they were able to prove.
44.25.8.1^- paul made his defense -:
44.25.8.2^neither against the law of the jews, nor against the temple, nor against caesar, in anything have i sinned.
44.25.9.1^- festus however, wishing on the jews a favor to lay, answering - paul, said, are you willing to jerusalem having gone up, there concerning these things to be judged before me?
44.25.10.1^said then - paul, before the judgment seat of caesar standing i am, where me it behooves to be judged.
44.25.10.2^to the jews nothing i have done wrong, as also you very well know.
44.25.11.1^if indeed therefore i do wrong, and worthy of death have done anything, not i do refuse - to die.
44.25.11.2^if however nothing there is of which they can accuse me, no one me can to them give up.
44.25.11.3^to caesar i appeal!
44.25.12.1^then - festus, having conferred with the council, answered, to caesar you have appealed;
44.25.12.2^to caesar you will go!
44.25.13.1^days now having passed some, agrippa the king and bernice came down to caesarea, greeting - festus.
44.25.14.1^as now many days they stayed there, - festus, the king laid before, the things relating to - paul, saying, a man certain there is left by felix as a prisoner,
44.25.15.1^concerning whom, having been my in jerusalem, made a presentation the chief priests and the elders of the jews, asking against him judgment,
44.25.16.1^to whom i answered that not it is the custom with romans to give up any man before that the one being accused to face may have it the accusers the opportunity, and of defense he may have concerning the accusation.
44.25.17.1^having come together therefore of them here, delay no having made, the next day having sat on the judgment seat, i commanded to be brought the man,
44.25.18.1^concerning whom, having stood up, the accusers no charge were bringing of which i was expecting crimes.
44.25.19.1^questions however certain concerning the own religion they had against him, and concerning a certain jesus having been dead, whom was affirming - paul to be alive.
44.25.20.1^being perplexed now, i - concerning this inquiry was asking if he was willing to go to jerusalem and there to be judged concerning these things.
44.25.21.1^- but of paul having appealed for to be kept himself for the - emperor s decision, i commanded to be kept him until that i might send him to caesar.
44.25.22.1^agrippa then said to - festus, i have been wanting also myself the man to hear.
44.25.22.2^tomorrow, he says, you will hear him.
44.25.23.1^on the therefore next day, having come - agrippa and - bernice with great pomp, and having entered into the audience hall, with both the commanders and men - in prominence in the city, and having commanded - festus, was brought in - paul.
44.25.24.1^and says - festus, agrippa king, and all the being present with us men, you see this one, concerning whom all the multitude of the jews pleaded with me, in both jerusalem and here, crying out that not he ought of him to live no longer.
44.25.25.1^i however, having understood nothing worthy him of death to have done, himself and of this one having appealed to the emperor, i determined to send him,
44.25.26.1^concerning whom, definite anything to write to my lord, not i have.
44.25.26.2^therefore i have brought him before you all, and especially before you, king agrippa, so that the examination having taken place, i might have something to write.
44.25.27.1^absurd for to me it seems in sending a prisoner, not also the against him charges to specify.
44.26.1.1^agrippa then to - paul was saying, it is permitted you for yourself to speak.
44.26.1.2^then - paul, having stretched out the hand, began his defense:
44.26.2.1^concerning all of which i am accused by the jews, king agrippa, i esteem myself fortunate before you, being about today to defend myself.
44.26.3.1^especially acquainted being you with all the of the jews customs, and also controversies;
44.26.3.2^therefore i implore you patiently to hear me.
44.26.4.1^the indeed then manner of life of me, which is from youth, - from its beginning having been among the nation of me, in also jerusalem, know all the jews,
44.26.5.1^knowing me from the first, if they would be willing to testify, that according to the strictest sect - of our religion i lived as a pharisee.
44.26.6.1^and now for the hope of the to the fathers of us promise having been made by - god, i stand being judged,
44.26.7.1^to which the twelve tribes of us in earnestness, night and day, serving, hope to attain;
44.26.7.2^concerning which hope i am accused by the jews, o king.
44.26.8.1^why incredible is it judged by you if - god the dead raises?
44.26.9.1^i indeed therefore thought in myself to the name of jesus - of nazareth, i ought many things contrary to do,
44.26.10.1^which also i did in jerusalem;
44.26.10.2^and many also of the saints i in prisons locked up, the from the chief priests authority having received;
44.26.10.3^being put to death then they, i cast against them a vote.
44.26.11.1^and in all the synagogues, often punishing them, i was compelling them to blaspheme.
44.26.11.2^exceedingly then being furious against them, i kept persecuting them as far as even to - foreign cities,
44.26.12.1^during which, journeying to - damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,
44.26.13.1^day mid on the road i saw, o king, from heaven above, the brightness of the sun, having shone around me, a light;
44.26.13.2^and those with me journeying.
44.26.14.1^all and having fallen down of us to the ground, i heard a voice saying to me in the hebrew language, saul, saul, why me persecute you?
44.26.14.2^it is hard for you against the goads to kick.
44.26.15.1^i then said, who are you, lord?
44.26.15.2^- and the lord said, i am jesus, whom you are persecuting.
44.26.16.1^but rise up and stand on the feet of you;
44.26.16.2^for this purpose for i have appeared to you, to appoint you a servant and a witness of that which both you have seen of me, of the things in which then i will appear to you,
44.26.17.1^delivering you out from the people and from the gentiles, to whom i am sending you,
44.26.18.1^to open eyes of them, that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power - of satan to - god, that may receive they forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those having been sanctified by faith that is in me.
44.26.19.1^so then, o king agrippa, not i was disobedient to the heavenly vision,
44.26.20.1^but to those in damascus first, both and jerusalem all, and the region - of judea, and to the gentiles, i kept declaring to repent and to turn to - god, worthy - of repentance works doing.
44.26.21.1^on account of these things, me the jews having seized being in the temple, they were attempting to kill.
44.26.22.1^help therefore having obtained - from - god unto the day this, i have stood, bearing witness to small both and to great, nothing other saying than what both the prophets said was about to happen, and moses,
44.26.23.1^that would suffer the christ;
44.26.23.2^as first through resurrection from the dead, light he is about to preach to both our people and to the gentiles.
44.26.24.1^these things now of him saying in his defense, - festus in a loud - voice said, you are insane, paul!
44.26.24.2^the great of you learning, to insanity turns you!
44.26.25.1^- but paul, not i am insane, says, most excellent festus, but of truth and sobriety words i utter.
44.26.26.1^understands for concerning these things the king, to whom also using boldness i speak.
44.26.26.2^are hidden from for him any of these things not.
44.26.26.3^i am persuaded none not for is in a corner done, of these things.
44.26.27.1^believe you, king agrippa, the prophets?
44.26.27.2^i know that you believe.
44.26.28.1^- then agrippa said to - paul, within so little me do you persuade a christian to become?
44.26.29.1^- and paul said, i would wish - - to god, both in a little and in much, not only you but also all those hearing me this day, to become such as also i am, except the chains these.
44.26.30.1^rose up then the king and the governor - and bernice and those sitting with them,
44.26.31.1^and having withdrawn, they began speaking to one another saying -, nothing of death or of chains worthy any is doing the man this.
44.26.32.1^agrippa then to festus was saying, have been released could the man this, if not he had appealed to caesar.
44.27.1.1^when now was determined - sailing our to - italy, they delivered - both paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion, named julius of the cohort of augustus.
44.27.2.1^having boarded then a ship of adramyttium being about to sail to the along - asia places, we set sail   being with us aristarchus, a macedonian of thessalonica.
44.27.3.1^the then next day, we landed at sidon.
44.27.3.2^considerately then - julius, - paul having treated, allowed him to his friends having gone, care to receive.
44.27.4.1^and from there having set sail, we sailed under - cyprus, because of - the winds being contrary.
44.27.5.1^- and then - along - cilicia and pamphylia, having sailed across the sea, we came to myra - of lycia.
44.27.6.1^and there, having found the centurion a ship of alexandria sailing to - italy, he placed us into it.
44.27.7.1^for many now days, sailing slowly and with difficulty, having arrived off - cnidus, not permitting us the wind, we sailed under - crete, off salmone.
44.27.8.1^with difficulty and coasting along it, we came to a place certain called fair havens, to which near the city was of lasea.
44.27.9.1^much now time having passed, and being already dangerous the voyage, because of - even the fast already being over, was admonishing them - paul,
44.27.10.1^saying to them, men, i understand that with disaster and much loss, not only of the cargo and of the ship, but also the lives of us, is about to be the voyage.
44.27.11.1^- but the centurion by the pilot and the ship owner rather was persuaded, than by the things by paul spoken.
44.27.12.1^unsuitable now the harbor being to winter in, the majority reached a decision to set sail from there, if somehow they might be able, having arrived at phoenix, to winter there   a harbor - of crete, looking toward the southwest and toward the northwest.
44.27.13.1^having blown gently now a south wind, having thought the purpose to have obtained, having weighed anchor, very near they began coasting along - crete.
44.27.14.1^after not long however, there came down from it a wind tempestuous, - called the northeaster.
44.27.15.1^having been caught then the ship, and not being able to face to the wind, having given way we were driven along.
44.27.16.1^an island then certain having run under, called cauda, we were able with difficulty control to gain of the lifeboat,
44.27.17.1^which having taken up, supports they began using, undergirding the ship.
44.27.17.2^fearing then lest into the sandbars of syrtis they should fall, having lowered the gear, thus they were driven along.
44.27.18.1^violently now being storm-tossed of us, on the next day a jettison of cargo they began to make,
44.27.19.1^and on the third day, with their own hands the tackle of the ship they cast away.
44.27.20.1^neither now sun nor stars appearing for many days, tempest and no small lying on us, from then on was abandoned hope all - being saved of us.
44.27.21.1^much also time without food there being, at that time having stood up - paul in midst of them, he said, it behooved you indeed, o men, having been obedient to me, not to have set sail from - crete, to have incurred then the disaster this and - loss.
44.27.22.1^and yet - now i exhort you to keep up your courage;
44.27.22.2^loss for of life none there will be from among you, only of the ship.
44.27.23.1^stood by for me this - night -, of god, whose am i whom and i serve, an angel,
44.27.24.1^saying, not fear, paul;
44.27.24.2^caesar you it behooves to stand before.
44.27.24.3^and behold, has granted to you - god all those sailing with you.
44.27.25.1^therefore take courage, men;
44.27.25.2^i believe for - god that thus it will be, according to the way it has been said to me.
44.27.26.1^upon an island however certain it behooves us to fall.
44.27.27.1^when then the fourteenth night had come, being driven about of us in the adriatic, toward the middle of the night, began sensing the sailors to be drawing near some to them land.
44.27.28.1^and having taken soundings, they found fathoms twenty.
44.27.28.2^a little then having gone farther and again having taken soundings, they found fathoms fifteen.
44.27.29.1^fearing then lest somewhere on rocky places we might fall, out of the stern having cast anchors four, they were praying for day to come.
44.27.30.1^of the then sailors seeking to flee out of the ship and having let down the lifeboat into the sea under pretense as from the bow anchors being about to cast out,
44.27.31.1^said - paul to the centurion and to the soldiers, if not these remain in the ship, you to be saved not are able.
44.27.32.1^then cut away the soldiers the ropes of the lifeboat, and allowed her to fall away.
44.27.33.1^until then that day was about to come, kept urging - paul all to partake of food, saying, the fourteenth today is day watching without eating you continue, nothing having taken.
44.27.34.1^therefore i exhort you to take food;
44.27.34.2^this indeed for - of you preservation is;
44.27.34.3^not one for of you a hair of the head will perish.
44.27.35.1^having said now these things and having taken bread, he gave thanks - to god before all, and having broken it, he began to eat.
44.27.36.1^encouraged then having been, all also themselves took food.
44.27.37.1^we were then the altogether souls in the ship, two hundred seventy six.
44.27.38.1^having been filled then with food, they began to lighten the ship, casting out the wheat into the sea.
44.27.39.1^when now day it was, the land not they did recognize;
44.27.39.2^a bay however certain they noticed, having a shore, on which they determined, if they should be able, to drive the ship.
44.27.40.1^and the anchors having cut away, they left them in the sea, at the same time having loosened the ropes of the rudders.
44.27.40.2^and having hoisted the foresail to the blowing wind, they began making for the shore.
44.27.41.1^having fallen however into a place between two seas, they ran aground the vessel;
44.27.41.2^and the indeed bow having stuck fast, it remained immovable, - and the stern was being broken up by the violence of the waves.
44.27.42.1^of the now soldiers, the plan was that the prisoners they should kill, lest anyone, having swum away, should escape.
44.27.43.1^- but the centurion, desiring to save - paul, hindered them of the purpose;
44.27.43.2^he commanded then those being able to swim, having cast themselves off first, on the land to go out,
44.27.44.1^and the rest, some indeed on boards, some then on things - from the ship.
44.27.44.2^and thus it came to pass that all were brought safely to the land.
44.28.1.1^and having been saved, then we found out that malta the island is called.
44.28.2.1^- and the natives were showing not just the ordinary kindness to us.
44.28.2.2^having kindled for a fire, they received all of us because of the rain - coming on and because of the cold.
44.28.3.1^having gathered now - paul of sticks a quantity, and having laid them on the fire, a viper out from the heat having come, fastened on the hand of him.
44.28.4.1^when then saw the natives hanging the beast from the hand of him, to one another they began to say, by all means a murderer is the man this, whom having been saved from the sea, - justice to live not has permitted.
44.28.5.1^the one indeed then, having shaken off the creature into the fire, he suffered no injury.
44.28.6.1^- but they were expecting him to be about to become inflamed, or to fall down suddenly dead.
44.28.6.2^a while great however of them waiting and seeing nothing amiss to him happening, having changed their opinion, they began declaring him to be a god.
44.28.7.1^in now the parts around the place that were lands belonging to the chief of the island, named publius, who having received us three, days hospitably entertained us.
44.28.8.1^it came to pass then, the father - of publius, fevers and dysentery oppressed with, was lying, toward whom - paul, having entered and having prayed, having laid the hands on him, healed him.
44.28.9.1^of this then having taken place, also the rest - in the island having infirmities were coming and were healed,
44.28.10.1^who also with many honors honored us, and on setting sail, they laid on us the things for the needs.
44.28.11.1^after then three months, we sailed in a ship having wintered in the island, alexandrian, with a figurehead of the dioscuri.
44.28.12.1^and having put in at syracuse, we stayed days three,
44.28.13.1^from where having gone around, we arrived at rhegium.
44.28.13.2^and after one day, having come on a south wind, on the second day we came to puteoli,
44.28.14.1^where having found some brothers, we were entreated with them to remain days seven.
44.28.14.2^and so to - rome we came.
44.28.15.1^and from there the brothers, having heard the things concerning us, came out to meet us as far as of appius the market and the three taverns, whom having seen - paul, having given thanks to god, took courage.
44.28.16.1^when now we came to rome, was allowed - paul to stay by himself, with the guarding him soldier.
44.28.17.1^it came to pass then, after days three called together he those being of the jews leaders.
44.28.17.2^having come together then of them, he was saying to them, i, men, brothers, nothing against having done the people or the customs - of our fathers, a prisoner from jerusalem was delivered into the hands of the romans,
44.28.18.1^who having examined me, were wanting to let me go, on account of - not one cause of death existing in me.
44.28.19.1^objecting however of the jews, i was compelled to appeal to caesar, not as the nation of me having anything to lay against.
44.28.20.1^for this therefore - cause i have called you, to see and to speak to you;
44.28.20.2^because of for the hope - of israel, the chain this i have around me.
44.28.21.1^- and to him they said, we neither letters concerning you received from - judea, nor having arrived any of the brothers reported or said anything concerning you evil.
44.28.22.1^we deem it worthy however from you to hear what you think, concerning truly for the sect this, known to us it is that everywhere it is spoken against.
44.28.23.1^having appointed then him a day, came to him to the lodging many, to whom he expounded, fully testifying to the kingdom - of god, persuading then them concerning - jesus from both the law of moses and the prophets, from morning to evening.
44.28.24.1^and some indeed were persuaded of the things he is speaking;
44.28.24.2^some however refused to believe.
44.28.25.1^discordant then being with one another, they began to leave, having spoken - paul word one -:
44.28.25.2^rightly the spirit - holy spoke by isaiah the prophet to the fathers of you,
44.28.26.1^saying:
44.28.26.2^go to the people this and say, in hearing you will hear and no not understand;
44.28.26.3^and in seeing you will see and no not perceive.
44.28.27.1^has grown dull for the heart of the people this, and with the ears barely they hear, and the eyes of them they have closed, lest ever they should see with the eyes, and with the ears they should hear, and with the heart they should understand, and should turn, and i will heal them.
44.28.28.1^known therefore be it to you that to the gentiles has been sent this - salvation - of god;
44.28.28.2^they then will listen!
44.28.30.1^he stayed then two years whole in his own rented house, and was welcoming all - coming unto him,
44.28.31.1^proclaiming the kingdom - of god and teaching the things concerning the lord jesus christ with all boldness unhinderedly.
45.1.1.1^paul, a servant of christ jesus, a called apostle having been set apart for the gospel of god,
45.1.2.1^which he promised beforehand through the prophets of him in the scriptures holy,
45.1.3.1^concerning the son of him, - having come of the seed of david according to flesh,
45.1.4.1^- having been declared son of god in power according to the spirit of holiness by resurrection from the dead, jesus christ, the lord of us;
45.1.5.1^through whom we have received grace and apostleship unto obedience of faith among all the gentiles on behalf of the name of him,
45.1.6.1^among whom are also you called of jesus christ.
45.1.7.1^to all those being in rome, beloved of god, called saints:
45.1.7.2^grace to you and peace from god the father of us and the lord jesus christ.
45.1.8.1^first indeed, i thank the god of me through jesus christ for all of you, because the faith of you is being proclaimed in all the world.
45.1.9.1^witness for my is - god, whom i serve in the spirit of me in the gospel of the son of him, how unceasingly mention of you i make,
45.1.10.1^always upon the prayers of me imploring, if perhaps now at last i will make a prosperous journey by the will - of god, to come to you.
45.1.11.1^i long for to see you, that some i may impart gift to you spiritual, to the strengthening of you,
45.1.12.1^that now is, to be encouraged together among you, through the among one another faith of you both and of me.
45.1.13.1^not i do want now you to be ignorant, brothers, that many times i purposed to come to you, and was hindered, until the present, that some fruit i might have also among you, as even among the other gentiles.
45.1.14.1^to greeks both and to barbarians, to the wise both and the foolish, a debtor i am.
45.1.15.1^thus - as to me there is readiness also to you who are in rome, to preach the gospel.
45.1.16.1^not for i am ashamed of the gospel, the power for of god it is, unto salvation to everyone - believing   to jewish both first and to greek.
45.1.17.1^the righteousness for of god in it is revealed, from faith to faith, as it has been written:
45.1.17.2^- and the righteous by faith will live.
45.1.18.1^is revealed for the wrath of god from heaven upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, - the truth by unrighteousness suppressing,
45.1.19.1^because the known - of god manifest is among them, - god for to them has revealed it.
45.1.20.1^the for invisible qualities of him from the creation of the world, by the things made being understood, are clearly seen, the both eternal of him power and divinity, for - to be them without excuse.
45.1.21.1^for having known - god, not as god they glorified him, or were thankful, but they became futile in the thinking of them, and was darkened the foolish of them heart.
45.1.22.1^professing to be wise, they became fools,
45.1.23.1^and they changed the glory of the immortal god into a likeness of an image of mortal man and birds and quadrupeds and creeping things.
45.1.24.1^therefore gave up them - god in the desires of the hearts of them to impurity - to dishonor the bodies of them between themselves,
45.1.25.1^who changed the truth - of god into the falsehood, and reverenced and served the created thing beyond the one having created it, who is blessed to the ages!
45.1.25.2^amen.
45.1.26.1^because of this gave up them - god to passions of dishonor.
45.1.26.2^- even for females of them changed the natural use into that contrary to nature.
45.1.27.1^likewise then also the males, having left the natural use of the female, were inflamed in the desire of them toward one another, males with males, the shame working out, and the recompense which was fitting of the error of them, in themselves receiving.
45.1.28.1^and as not they did see fit - god to have in their knowledge, gave up them - god to a depraved mind, to do things not being proper;
45.1.29.1^being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, malice;
45.1.29.2^full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness;
45.1.29.3^gossips,
45.1.30.1^slanderers, hateful to god, insolent, arrogant, boastful;
45.1.30.2^inventors of evil things, to parents disobedient;
45.1.31.1^foolish, untrustworthy, heartless, unmerciful;
45.1.32.1^who the righteous decree - of god having known, that those such things doing, worthy of death are, not only them are practicing, but also are approving of those practicing them.
45.2.1.1^therefore inexcusable you are, o man, each one who is judging.
45.2.1.2^in that which for you judge the other, yourself you are condemning;
45.2.1.3^- for the same things you do, the one judging.
45.2.2.1^we know however that the judgment - of god is according to truth, upon those - such things practicing.
45.2.3.1^suppose you now this, o man, the one judging those - such things practicing, and doing them yourself, that you will escape the judgment - of god?
45.2.4.1^or the riches of the kindness of him, and the forbearance, and the patience despise you, not knowing that the kindness - of god to repentance you leads?
45.2.5.1^because of however the hardness of you and unrepentant heart, you are treasuring up to yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of righteous judgement - of god,
45.2.6.1^who will give to each, according to the works of him,
45.2.7.1^to those who indeed with endurance in work good, glory and honor and immortality are seeking, life eternal;
45.2.8.1^to those however of self-interest and disobeying the truth, being persuaded about however - unrighteousness, wrath and anger;
45.2.9.1^tribulation and distress upon every soul of man - working - evil, of jewish both first, and also of greek;
45.2.10.1^glory however, and honor, and peace to everyone - doing - good, to jewish both first, and to greek.
45.2.11.1^not for there is partiality with - god.
45.2.12.1^as many as for without the law have sinned, without the law also will perish;
45.2.12.2^and as many as in the law have sinned, by the law will be judged;
45.2.13.1^not for the hearers of the law are righteous with - god, but the doers of the law will be justified.
45.2.14.1^when for gentiles, - not the law having, by nature the things of the law do, these the law not having to themselves are a law,
45.2.15.1^who show the work of the law, written in the hearts of them, bearing witness their - conscience, and between one another, the thoughts accusing or also defending them
45.2.16.1^on the day when will judge - god the secrets - of men, according to the gospel of me, by christ jesus.
45.2.17.1^if however you a jew are called, and rely on the law, and boast in god;
45.2.18.1^and know the will, and approve the things being superior, being instructed out of the law;
45.2.19.1^are persuaded that then you yourself a guide are, of the blind, a light to those in darkness,
45.2.20.1^an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, having the embodiment - of knowledge and of the truth in the law
45.2.21.1^you then teaching another, yourself not do you teach?
45.2.21.2^you preaching not to steal, do you steal?
45.2.22.1^you saying not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery?
45.2.22.2^you abhorring - idols, do you rob temples?
45.2.23.1^you who in law boast, through the transgression of the law, - god dishonor you?
45.2.24.1^- for, the name - of god through you is blasphemed among the gentiles,  as it has been written.
45.2.25.1^circumcision indeed - profits, if the law you do;
45.2.25.2^if however a transgressor of law you are, the circumcision of you uncircumcision has become.
45.2.26.1^if therefore the uncircumcision, the requirements of the law keeps, not the uncircumcision of him for circumcision will be reckoned?
45.2.27.1^and will judge the by nature uncircumcision, the law fulfilling, you who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of law.
45.2.28.1^not for the one on the outward a jew is;
45.2.28.2^neither the one outwardly, the outward in flesh, is circumcision;
45.2.29.1^but he who is on the inward a jew is one;
45.2.29.2^and circumcision is of heart, in spirit, not in letter;
45.2.29.3^of whom the praise is not of men, but of - god.
45.3.1.1^what then is the superiority of the jew?
45.3.1.2^or what is the benefit of the circumcision?
45.3.2.1^much in every way.
45.3.2.2^chiefly indeed for that they were entrusted with the oracles - of god.
45.3.3.1^what for if disbelieved some?
45.3.3.2^not the unbelief of them, the faithfulness - of god will nullify?
45.3.4.1^never may it be!
45.3.4.2^let be however - god true, every now man a liar, as it has been written:
45.3.4.3^that - you may be justified in the words of you, and will prevail in - being judged your.
45.3.5.1^if however the unrighteousness of us, god s righteousness shows, what shall we say?
45.3.5.2^is unrighteous - god, - inflicting the wrath?
45.3.5.3^according to man i speak.
45.3.6.1^never may it be!
45.3.6.2^otherwise, how will judge - god the world?
45.3.7.1^if however the truth - of god, in - my lie, abounded to the glory of him, why still also i as a sinner am judged?
45.3.8.1^and is it not, as we are slanderously charged, and as affirm some that us to say -, let us do things evil, that may come the good things?
45.3.8.2^their - condemnation just is.
45.3.9.1^what then?
45.3.9.2^are we better?
45.3.9.3^not at all.
45.3.9.4^we have already charged for jews both and greeks all under sin to be.
45.3.10.1^as it has been written -:
45.3.10.2^none there is righteous, not even one;
45.3.11.1^none there is - understanding;
45.3.11.2^none there is - seeking after - god.
45.3.12.1^all have turned away, together they have become worthless;
45.3.12.2^none there is who is practicing good, not there is so much as one.
45.3.13.1^a grave having been opened the throat of them is;
45.3.13.2^with the tongues of them they keep practicing deceit;
45.3.13.3^the venom of vipers is under the lips of them,
45.3.14.1^of whom the mouth of cursing and of bitterness is full;
45.3.15.1^swift are the feet of them to shed blood;
45.3.16.1^ruin and misery are in the paths of them;
45.3.17.1^and the way of peace not they have known.
45.3.18.1^not there is fear of god before the eyes of them.
45.3.19.1^we know now that whatever the law says, to those under the law it speaks, so that every mouth may be stopped, and under judgment may be all the world - to god.
45.3.20.1^therefore by works of the law not will be justified any flesh before him;
45.3.20.2^through for the law is knowledge of sin.
45.3.21.1^now however, apart from law, the righteousness of god has been revealed, being borne witness to by the law and the prophets,
45.3.22.1^the righteousness now of god through faith from jesus christ toward all those believing.
45.3.22.2^not for there is distinction.
45.3.23.1^all for have sinned and fall short of the glory - of god,
45.3.24.1^being justified freely by the of him grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus,
45.3.25.1^whom set forth as - god a propitiation, through - faith in - his blood, for a showing forth of the righteousness of him, because of the forbearance of the having taken place beforehand sins
45.3.26.1^in the forbearance - of god;
45.3.26.2^for of the showing forth the righteousness of him in the present time, for - to be him just and justifying the one of faith of jesus.
45.3.27.1^where then is the boasting?
45.3.27.2^it has been excluded.
45.3.27.3^through what principle?
45.3.27.4^that of works?
45.3.27.5^no, but through the principle of faith.
45.3.28.1^we reckon therefore to be justified by faith a man, apart from works of the law.
45.3.29.1^or of jews is he the god only, not also of gentiles?
45.3.29.2^yes, also of gentiles,
45.3.30.1^since indeed one - god is, who will justify the circumcision by faith and the uncircumcision through the same faith.
45.3.31.1^law then do we nullify through - faith?
45.3.31.2^never may it be!
45.3.31.3^instead, law we uphold.
45.4.1.1^what then shall we say discovered abraham, the father of us, according to the flesh?
45.4.2.1^if for abraham by works was justified, he has ground of boasting, but not toward god.
45.4.3.1^what for the scripture says?
45.4.3.2^believed then abraham - god, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness.
45.4.4.1^to the one now working, the reward not is reckoned according to grace, but according to debt.
45.4.5.1^to the one however not working, believing however on the one justifying the ungodly, is reckoned the faith of him for righteousness,
45.4.6.1^just as also david declares the blessedness of the man to whom - god credits righteousness apart from works:
45.4.7.1^blessed are they of whom are forgiven the lawless deeds, and of whom are covered the sins;
45.4.8.1^blessed the man against whom no not will reckon the lord sin.
45.4.9.1^is the blessing then this on the circumcision, or also on the uncircumcision?
45.4.9.2^we are saying for was credited - to abraham the faith as righteousness.
45.4.10.1^how then was it credited?
45.4.10.2^in circumcision being, or in uncircumcision?
45.4.10.3^not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
45.4.11.1^and the sign he received of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith that he had while in the uncircumcision, for the to be him father of all those believing, in uncircumcision, for - to be credited also to them the righteousness,
45.4.12.1^and father of circumcision to those not of circumcision only, but also to those walking in the steps of the during uncircumcision faith of the father of us, abraham.
45.4.13.1^not for through the law the promise was - to abraham or the descendants of him that heir he should be of the world, but through the righteousness of faith.
45.4.14.1^if for those of the law are heirs, has been made void - faith, and made of no effect the promise.
45.4.15.1^- for law wrath brings;
45.4.15.2^where now no there is law, neither is transgression.
45.4.16.1^therefore it is of faith, that it may be according to grace, for - to be sure the promise to all the seed, not to that of the law only, but also to that of the faith of abraham, who is the father of all of us
45.4.17.1^as it has been written -:
45.4.17.2^a father of many nations i have made you.
45.4.17.3^before whom he believed god, the one giving life to the dead and calling the things not into being even existing,
45.4.18.1^who against hope, in hope believed, for - to become him the father of many nations, according to that having been spoken, so shall be the offspring of you.
45.4.19.1^and not having become weak in the faith, he considered - of himself the body already having become dead, a hundred years old about being, and the lifelessness of the womb of sarah.
45.4.20.1^at however the promise - of god, not he did waver - through unbelief, but was strengthened - in faith, having given glory - to god,
45.4.21.1^and having been fully assured that what he had promised, able he is also to do.
45.4.22.1^therefore also it was credited to him unto righteousness.
45.4.23.1^not it was written now on account of him alone that it was credited to him,
45.4.24.1^but also on account of us, to whom it is about to be credited, to those believing on the one having raised jesus the lord of us out from the dead,
45.4.25.1^who was delivered over for the trespasses of us, and was raised for the justification of us.
45.5.1.1^having been justified therefore by faith, peace we have with - god, through the lord of us jesus christ,
45.5.2.1^through whom also - access we have by the faith into the grace this in which we stand;
45.5.2.2^and we boast in hope of the glory - of god.
45.5.3.1^not only so now, but also we glory in - tribulations, knowing that - tribulation, perseverance produces;
45.5.4.1^- and perseverance, character;
45.5.4.2^- and character, hope.
45.5.5.1^- and hope not does make us ashamed, because the love - of god has been poured out into the hearts of us through the spirit holy, the one having been given to us.
45.5.6.1^yet indeed christ, being of us without strength still, according to the right time, for the ungodly died.
45.5.7.1^rarely indeed for a righteous man anyone will die;
45.5.7.2^on behalf of though the good man, perhaps someone even would dare to die.
45.5.8.1^demonstrates however the of himself love to us - god, that still sinners being of us, christ for us died.
45.5.9.1^much therefore more, having been justified now by the blood of him, we will be saved by him from the wrath!
45.5.10.1^if for, enemies being, we were reconciled - to god through the death of the son of him, much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved in the life of him!
45.5.11.1^not only so now, but also we are rejoicing in - god through the lord of us jesus christ, through whom now the reconciliation we have received.
45.5.12.1^because of this, just as through one man - sin into the world entered, and through - sin, - death;
45.5.12.2^also thus to all men - death passed, for that all sinned.
45.5.13.1^until for the law, sin was in the world;
45.5.13.2^sin however not is imputed, not there being law.
45.5.14.1^nevertheless reigned - death from adam until moses, even over those not having sinned in the likeness of the transgression of adam, who is a type of the coming one.
45.5.15.1^but is not like the trespass so also the gift.
45.5.15.2^if for by the of the one trespass, the many died, how much more the grace - of god and the gift in grace which is of the one man, jesus christ, to the many did abound!
45.5.16.1^and is not as through one having sinned, the gift.
45.5.16.2^the truly for judgment was, of one was unto condemnation;
45.5.16.3^- but the gift is out of many trespasses, unto justification.
45.5.17.1^if for, by the of the one trespass, - death reigned through the one, how much more those the abundance - of grace, and of the gift - of righteousness receiving, in life will reign through the one, jesus christ!
45.5.18.1^so then, just as by one trespass, to all men it is unto condemnation, so also by one act of righteousness, to all men it is unto justification of life.
45.5.19.1^for as for through the disobedience of the one man, sinners were made the many, so also through the obedience of the one, righteous will be made the many.
45.5.20.1^the law now entered, so that might abound the trespass;
45.5.20.2^where however abounded - sin, overabounded - grace,
45.5.21.1^so that just as reigned the sin in - death, so also - grace might reign through righteousness, unto life eternal, through jesus christ the lord of us.
45.6.1.1^what then will we say?
45.6.1.2^shall we continue - in sin, that - grace may abound?
45.6.2.1^never may it be!
45.6.2.2^who we died - to sin, how still shall we live in it?
45.6.3.1^or are you unaware that as many as have been baptized into christ jesus, into the death of him have been baptized?
45.6.4.1^we were buried therefore with him through - baptism into - death, so that just as was raised up christ out from the dead by the glory of the father, so also we in newness of life should walk.
45.6.5.1^if for united we have become in the likeness of the death of him, certainly also of the resurrection we will be;
45.6.6.1^this knowing, that - old of us self was crucified with him, so that might be annulled the body - of sin, that no longer are enslaved we - to sin.
45.6.7.1^the one for having died has been freed from - sin.
45.6.8.1^if now we died with christ, we believe that also we will live with him,
45.6.9.1^knowing that christ, having been raised up out from the dead, no more dies.
45.6.9.2^death him no longer rules over.
45.6.10.1^that which for he died, - to sin he died once for all;
45.6.10.2^that which however he lives, he lives - to god.
45.6.11.1^so also you, consider yourselves to be dead indeed - to sin, living however - to god in christ jesus.
45.6.12.1^not therefore let reign - sin in the mortal of you body, in order - to obey the desires of it.
45.6.13.1^neither yield the members of you as instruments of unrighteousness - to sin, but yield yourselves - to god, as out from the dead living, and the members of you, as instruments of righteousness - to god.
45.6.14.1^sin for you not will rule over, not for you are under law, but under grace.
45.6.15.1^what then?
45.6.15.2^shall we sin because not we are under law, but under grace?
45.6.15.3^never may it be!
45.6.16.1^not know you that to whom you yield yourselves as slaves for obedience, slaves you are to him whom you obey, whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?
45.6.17.1^thanks be however - to god that you used to be slaves - of sin, you have become obedient now from the heart, to which you were handed over to the form of teaching.
45.6.18.1^having been set free now from - sin, you have become slaves - to righteousness.
45.6.19.1^in human terms i speak on account of the weakness of the flesh of you.
45.6.19.2^for as for you yielded the members of you in bondage - to impurity and to lawlessness unto - lawlessness, so now yield the members of you in bondage - to righteousness unto sanctification.
45.6.20.1^when for slaves you were - of sin, free you were - from righteousness.
45.6.21.1^what therefore fruit had you then in the things of which now you are ashamed?
45.6.21.2^the for end of those things is death.
45.6.22.1^now however, having been set free from - sin, having become slaves now - to god, you have the fruit of you unto sanctification;
45.6.22.2^- now the end is life eternal.
45.6.23.1^the for wages - of sin is death;
45.6.23.2^- but the gift - of god, life eternal in christ jesus the lord of us.
45.7.1.1^or are you ignorant, brothers   to those knowing for law i speak   that the law rules over the man for as long as the time he is alive?
45.7.2.1^the for married woman, to the living husband is bound by law;
45.7.2.2^if however should die the husband, she is cleared from the law of the husband.
45.7.3.1^then therefore, being alive the husband, an adulteress she will be called if she is to man another;
45.7.3.2^if however should die the husband, free she is from the law, so as for not to be her an adulteress, having been to man another.
45.7.4.1^likewise, brothers of me, also you have been put to death to the law through the body - of christ, for - to belong you to another, to the one out from the dead having been raised, so that we should bear fruit - to god.
45.7.5.1^while for we were in the flesh, the passions - of sins that were through the law were at work in the members of us, to the bringing forth of fruit - to death.
45.7.6.1^now however we have been released from the law, having died to that which we were bound, in order for to serve us in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.
45.7.7.1^what then shall we say?
45.7.7.2^is the law sin?
45.7.7.3^never may it be!
45.7.7.4^but - sin not i have known, if not by law;
45.7.7.5^- then for covetousness, not i had been conscious of, if not the law had said, not you shall covet.
45.7.8.1^an occasion however having taken - sin by the commandment, it produced in me all covetousness;
45.7.8.2^apart from for the law, sin is dead.
45.7.9.1^i however was alive apart from law once;
45.7.9.2^having come however the commandment, the sin revived;
45.7.10.1^i then died.
45.7.10.2^and proved to be me the commandment that was to life, this to death.
45.7.11.1^the for sin, an occasion having taken by the commandment, deceived me, and by it put me to death.
45.7.12.1^so - indeed the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.
45.7.13.1^that which then is good, to me has become death?
45.7.13.2^never may it be!
45.7.13.3^but - sin, in order that it might be shown to be sin, through that which is good to me is working out death;
45.7.13.4^so that might become beyond excess sinful, - sin through the commandment.
45.7.14.1^we know for that - the law spiritual is;
45.7.14.2^i however fleshly am, having been sold under - sin.
45.7.15.1^what for i do, not i understand;
45.7.15.2^not for what i want, this i do;
45.7.15.3^but what i hate, this i do.
45.7.16.1^if now that which not i do want, this i do, i consent to the law, that it is good.
45.7.17.1^in that case now, no longer i am doing it, but the dwelling in me sin.
45.7.18.1^i know for that nothing there dwells in me, that is in the flesh of me, good;
45.7.18.2^- for to will is present with me, - but to do the good, not.
45.7.19.1^not for that i desire i do good, but that not i do want evil, this i practice.
45.7.20.1^if now what not i do want, i this do, it is no longer i who do it, but - dwelling in me sin.
45.7.21.1^i find so the principle, that desiring me to do - good, that me - evil is present with.
45.7.22.1^i delight for in the law - of god, according to the inward man;
45.7.23.1^i see however another law in the members of me, warring against the law of the mind of me, and making captive me to the law - of sin, - being in the members of me.
45.7.24.1^o wretched i am man!
45.7.24.2^who me will deliver out of the body - of death this?
45.7.25.1^thanks be then to god, through jesus christ the lord of us!
45.7.25.2^then so, myself i with the indeed mind serve law god s, - but with the flesh the law of sin.
45.8.1.1^there is no therefore now condemnation to those in christ jesus.
45.8.2.1^- for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has set free you from the law - of sin and - of death.
45.8.3.1^- for powerless being the law, in that it was weak through the flesh, - god, - of himself son having sent, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, condemned - sin in the flesh,
45.8.4.1^so that the righteousness of the law should be fulfilled in us - not according to the flesh walking, but according to the spirit.
45.8.5.1^those for according to flesh being, the things of the flesh mind;
45.8.5.2^those however according to spirit, the things of the spirit.
45.8.6.1^the for mind of the flesh is death;
45.8.6.2^the but mind of the spirit, life and peace,
45.8.7.1^because the mind of the flesh is hostility toward god;
45.8.7.2^to for the law - of god not it is subject, nor even for can it be.
45.8.8.1^those now in flesh being, god to please not are able.
45.8.9.1^you now not are in flesh, but in spirit, if indeed the spirit of god dwells in you;
45.8.9.2^if however anyone the spirit of christ not has, he not is of him.
45.8.10.1^if however christ is in you, the indeed body is dead on account of sin, the however spirit is life on account of righteousness.
45.8.11.1^if now the spirit of the one having raised up - jesus out from the dead dwells in you, the one having raised up christ out from the dead will give life also to the mortal bodies of you, on account of - dwelling his spirit in you.
45.8.12.1^so then, brothers, debtors we are, not to the flesh, - according to flesh to live.
45.8.13.1^if for according to flesh you live, you are about to die;
45.8.13.2^if however by the spirit the deeds of the body you put to death, you will live.
45.8.14.1^as many as for by the spirit of god are led, these sons of god.
45.8.14.2^are
45.8.15.1^not for you have received a spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the spirit of divine adoption as sons, by whom we cry, abba!
45.8.15.2^- father!
45.8.16.1^himself the spirit bears witness with the spirit of us that we are children of god.
45.8.17.1^if now children, also heirs, heirs indeed of god, joint-heirs now of christ, if indeed we suffer with him, so that also we may be glorified together.
45.8.18.1^i reckon for that not comparable the sufferings of the present time are to the coming glory to be revealed to us.
45.8.19.1^the for earnest expectation of the creation, the revelation of the sons - of god awaits.
45.8.20.1^to the for futility, the creation was subjected, not willingly, but because of the one having subjected it, in hope
45.8.21.1^that also itself the creation will be set free from the bondage - of decay, into the freedom of the glory of the children - of god.
45.8.22.1^we know for that all the creation groans together and travails together until - now.
45.8.23.1^not only so now, but even ourselves, the firstfruit of the spirit having, we also ourselves in ourselves groan, divine adoption as sons awaiting, the redemption of the body of us.
45.8.24.1^in this for hope we were saved;
45.8.24.2^hope however being seen, not is hope;
45.8.24.3^what for sees any does he hope for?
45.8.25.1^if however, what not we see we hope for, in patience we await.
45.8.26.1^likewise now also, the spirit joins to help the weakness of us;
45.8.26.2^the for things which we should pray for as it behooves, not we know, but himself the spirit makes intercession, with groanings inexpressible.
45.8.27.1^the one now searching - hearts knows what is the mindset of the spirit, because according to god, he intercedes for the saints.
45.8.28.1^we know now that to those loving - god, all things work together for good, to those according to his purpose called being.
45.8.29.1^for those whom he foreknew, also he predestined to be conformed to the image of the son of him, for - to be him firstborn among many brothers.
45.8.30.1^those whom then he predestined, these also he called;
45.8.30.2^and whom he called, these also he justified;
45.8.30.3^whom then he justified, these also he glorified.
45.8.31.1^what then will we say to these things?
45.8.31.2^if - god is for us, who can be against us?
45.8.32.1^he who indeed the own son not spared, but for us all gave up him, how not also with him, things all us will he grant?
45.8.33.1^who will bring an accusation against the elect of god?
45.8.33.2^god is the one justifying.
45.8.34.1^who is the one condemning?
45.8.34.2^for it is christ jesus, the one having died, rather now having been raised up, who also is at the right hand - of god, who and is interceding for us.
45.8.35.1^who us will separate from the love - of christ?
45.8.35.2^tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?
45.8.36.1^as it has been written -:
45.8.36.2^for the sake of you, we face death all the day;
45.8.36.3^we were regarded as sheep of slaughter.
45.8.37.1^but in these things all, we more than conquer through the one having loved us.
45.8.38.1^i am persuaded for that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,
45.8.39.1^nor height, nor depth, nor any created thing other, will be able us to separate from the love - of god - in christ jesus the lord of us.
45.9.1.1^the truth i speak in christ.
45.9.1.2^not i am lying, bearing witness with me the conscience of me in the spirit holy,
45.9.2.1^that grief to me is great, and unceasing sorrow in the heart of me.
45.9.3.1^could wish for a curse to be myself i, separated from - christ for the brothers of me, - kinsmen of me, according to the flesh;
45.9.4.1^who are israelites, whose is the divine adoption as sons, and the glory, and the covenants, and the lawgiving, and the service, and the promises;
45.9.5.1^whose are the patriarchs;
45.9.5.2^and from whom is - christ - according to the flesh, - being over all god, blessed to the ages.
45.9.5.3^amen.
45.9.6.1^it is not as however, that has failed the word - of god.
45.9.6.2^not for all who are of israel, are these israel.
45.9.7.1^nor because they are seed of abraham are all children;
45.9.7.2^rather, in isaac will be named to you offspring
45.9.8.1^that is, not the children of the flesh, these are children - of god;
45.9.8.2^but the children of the promise are regarded as offspring.
45.9.9.1^of the promise for, the word is this:
45.9.9.2^at the time this, i will come, and there will be - to sarah a son.
45.9.10.1^not only then, but also rebecca, by one conception, having isaac the father of us,
45.9.11.1^not yet for having been born, nor having done anything good or evil, so that the according to election purpose - of god might stand,
45.9.12.1^not of works, but of the one calling, it was said to her -, the older will serve the younger.
45.9.13.1^as it has been written -:
45.9.13.2^jacob i loved, - but esau i hated.
45.9.14.1^what then shall we say?
45.9.14.2^not injustice with - god is there?
45.9.14.3^never may it be!
45.9.15.1^to moses for he says:
45.9.15.2^i will show mercy to whom - i may show mercy, and i will have compassion on whom - i may have compassion.
45.9.16.1^so then, it is not of the willing, nor of the running, but - showing mercy of god.
45.9.17.1^says for the scripture to pharaoh -:
45.9.17.2^for this very therefore i have raised up you, so that i might show in you the power of me, and that should be declared the name of me in all the earth.
45.9.18.1^so then, to whom he wants, he shows mercy;
45.9.18.2^whom now he wants, he hardens.
45.9.19.1^you will say to me then, why then still does he find fault?
45.9.19.2^the for purpose of him, who is resisting?
45.9.20.1^o man, but rather, you who are - answering against - god?
45.9.20.2^not will say the thing formed to the one having formed it, why me have you made like this?
45.9.21.1^or not has authority the potter over the clay, out of the same lump to make one indeed unto honor vessel, one however unto dishonor?
45.9.22.1^what if now desiring - god to show the wrath and to make known the power of him, bore with much patience, the vessels of wrath, having been fitted for destruction,
45.9.23.1^also that he might make known the riches of the glory of him upon the vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory,
45.9.24.1^whom even he has called, us not only out from the jews, but also out from the gentiles?
45.9.25.1^as also in - hosea he says:
45.9.25.2^i will call that which is not people of me, people of me;
45.9.25.3^and her not having been loved, having been loved,
45.9.26.1^and, it will happen that in the place where it was said to them, not people my are you, there they will be called sons of god the living.
45.9.27.1^isaiah also cries out concerning - israel:
45.9.27.2^though shall be the number of the sons of israel as the sand of the sea, only the remnant will be saved.
45.9.28.1^the sentence for concluding and bringing swiftly, will perform the lord upon the earth.
45.9.29.1^and, as foretold isaiah:
45.9.29.2^if not the lord of hosts had left us descendants, like sodom - we would have become, and like gomorrah - we would have been made.
45.9.30.1^what then will we say?
45.9.30.2^that gentiles - not pursuing righteousness, have attained righteousness, righteousness now that is by faith;
45.9.31.1^israel however, pursuing a law of righteousness, to that law not did attain.
45.9.32.1^because of why?
45.9.32.2^because it was not by faith, but as by works.
45.9.32.3^they stumbled over the stone - of stumbling,
45.9.33.1^as it has been written:
45.9.33.2^behold i lay in zion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense;
45.9.33.3^and the one believing on him, never will be put to shame.
45.10.1.1^brothers, the indeed desire - of my heart and the supplication to - god on behalf of them is for salvation.
45.10.2.1^i bear witness for about them, that zeal for god they have, but not according to knowledge.
45.10.3.1^being ignorant of for the - of god righteousness, and the own righteousness seeking to establish, to the righteousness - of god, not they submitted.
45.10.4.1^the end for of law is christ, unto righteousness to everyone - believing.
45.10.5.1^moses for writes of the righteousness that is of the law, that the having done these things man, will live by them.
45.10.6.1^the however of faith righteousness, thus speaks:
45.10.6.2^not you should say in the heart of you, who will ascend into - heaven?
45.10.6.3^that is, christ to bring down,
45.10.7.1^or, who will descend into the abyss?
45.10.7.2^that is, christ out from the dead to bring up.
45.10.8.1^but what says it?
45.10.8.2^near you the word is, in the mouth of you and in the heart of you.
45.10.8.3^that is, the word - of faith which we proclaim,
45.10.9.1^that if you confess with the mouth of you, the lord is jesus, and believe in the heart of you, that - god him raised out from the dead, you will be saved.
45.10.10.1^in the heart for is belief unto righteousness;
45.10.10.2^in the mouth now is confession unto salvation.
45.10.11.1^says for the scripture, everyone - believing on him not will be put to shame.
45.10.12.1^not for there is difference jew between and greek;
45.10.12.2^- for the same lord of all is rich toward all those calling him.
45.10.13.1^whoever for that - shall call upon the name of the lord will be saved.
45.10.14.1^how then shall they call on him whom not they believed?
45.10.14.2^how now shall they believe on him of whom not they have heard?
45.10.14.3^how now shall they hear apart from preaching?
45.10.15.1^how now shall they preach if not they are sent?
45.10.15.2^as it has been written:
45.10.15.3^how beautiful the feet of those proclaiming good news of good things!
45.10.16.1^but not all heeded the good news.
45.10.16.2^isaiah for says, lord, who has believed the report of us?
45.10.17.1^so - faith is from hearing, - and hearing through the word of christ.
45.10.18.1^but i ask, no not did they hear?
45.10.18.2^indeed:
45.10.18.3^into all the earth has gone out the voice of them;
45.10.18.4^and to the ends of the world, the words of them.
45.10.19.1^but i ask, not israel not did know?
45.10.19.2^first, moses says:
45.10.19.3^i will provoke to jealousy you by those not a nation;
45.10.19.4^by a nation without understanding, i will anger you.
45.10.20.1^isaiah then is very bold and says:
45.10.20.2^i was found by those me not seeking;
45.10.20.3^manifest i became to those me not inquiring after.
45.10.21.1^as for however, - israel, he says:
45.10.21.2^all the day, i have stretched out the hands of me, to a people disobeying and contradicting.
45.11.1.1^i ask then, not did reject - god the people of him?
45.11.1.2^never may it be!
45.11.1.3^also for i an israelite am, of the seed of abraham, of the tribe of benjamin.
45.11.2.1^not did reject - god the people of him, whom he foreknew.
45.11.2.2^or not know you in elijah what says the scripture, how he pleads - with god against - israel:
45.11.3.1^lord, the prophets of you they have killed;
45.11.3.2^the altars of you they have torn down;
45.11.3.3^and i have been left alone, and they are seeking the life of me.
45.11.4.1^but what was spoken to him the divine answer?
45.11.4.2^i have left to myself seven thousand men who not have bowed the knee - to baal.
45.11.5.1^thus then also, in the present time, a remnant according to the election of grace there has been.
45.11.6.1^if now by grace, no longer from works;
45.11.6.2^otherwise - grace no longer would be grace.
45.11.7.1^what then?
45.11.7.2^what is seeking israel, this not it has obtained;
45.11.7.3^- but the elect obtained it.
45.11.7.4^the now rest were hardened,
45.11.8.1^as it has been written:
45.11.8.2^gave them - god a spirit of stupor, eyes - not to see, and ears - not to hear, unto the today day.
45.11.9.1^and david says:
45.11.9.2^let be the table of them for a snare and for a trap, and for a stumbling block and for a retribution to them;
45.11.10.1^let be darkened the eyes of them, - not to see, and the backs of them, for ever bent over.
45.11.11.1^i ask then, not did they stumble that they might fall?
45.11.11.2^never may it be!
45.11.11.3^but in the of them trespass - is salvation to the gentiles, so as - to provoke to jealousy them.
45.11.12.1^if however, the trespass of them is riches of the world, and the failure of them is the riches of the gentiles, how much more the fullness of them!
45.11.13.1^to you now i am speaking, the gentiles.
45.11.13.2^upon as much as indeed therefore am i of the gentiles apostle, the ministry of me i magnify,
45.11.14.1^if at all i shall provoke to jealousy of me the flesh, and shall save some of them.
45.11.15.1^if for the rejection of them is the reconciliation of the world, what will be the acceptance, if not life out from the dead?
45.11.16.1^if now the firstfruit is holy, also the lump;
45.11.16.2^and if the root is holy, also the branches.
45.11.17.1^if however some of the branches were broken off, you now, a wild olive tree being, were grafted in among them, and a fellow-partaker of the root of the fatness of the olive tree have become,
45.11.18.1^not boast over the branches.
45.11.18.2^if now you boast against them, not you the root support, but the root you.
45.11.19.1^you will say then, were broken off branches, that i might be grafted in.
45.11.20.1^rightly so;
45.11.20.2^by the unbelief they were broken off;
45.11.20.3^you however - by faith stand.
45.11.20.4^not high be minded, but be afraid.
45.11.21.1^if for - god the according to nature branches not spared, not at all neither you will he spare.
45.11.22.1^behold therefore the kindness and severity of god;
45.11.22.2^upon indeed those having fallen, severity;
45.11.22.3^toward however you, kindness of god, if you continue in the kindness;
45.11.22.4^otherwise also you will be cut off.
45.11.23.1^even they now if not they continue - in unbelief, will be grafted in;
45.11.23.2^able for is - god again to graft in them.
45.11.24.1^if for you, out of the according to nature were cut off a wild olive tree, and, contrary to nature, were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more these, who according to nature are, will be grafted into the own olive tree!
45.11.25.1^not for i want you to be ignorant, brothers, of the mystery this, that not you may be in yourselves wise, that a hardening in part - to israel has happened, until that the fullness of the gentiles may come in;
45.11.26.1^and so all israel will be saved, as it has been written:
45.11.26.2^will come out of zion the one delivering, he will remove ungodliness from jacob.
45.11.27.1^and this is to them the from me covenant, when i shall take away the sins of them.
45.11.28.1^as regards indeed the gospel, they are enemies on account of you;
45.11.28.2^as regards however the election, beloved on account of the patriarchs.
45.11.29.1^irrevocable for are the gifts and the calling - of god.
45.11.30.1^just as for you once were disobedient - to god, now however have been shown mercy the of these disobedience,
45.11.31.1^so also these now have been disobedient, the for your mercy, so that also they now may have mercy shown them.
45.11.32.1^has bound up for - god - all in disobedience, that - all he may show mercy to.
45.11.33.1^o, the depth of riches, both of wisdom and knowledge of god!
45.11.33.2^how unsearchable the judgments of him, and untraceable the ways of him!
45.11.34.1^who for has known the mind of the lord, or who counselor of him has been?
45.11.35.1^or who has first given to him, and it will be recompensed to him?
45.11.36.1^for from him, and through him, and unto him - are all things.
45.11.36.2^to him be the glory to the ages!
45.11.36.3^amen.
45.12.1.1^i exhort therefore you, brothers, through the compassions - of god, to present the bodies of you a sacrifice living, holy, well-pleasing, - to god which is the reasonable service of you.
45.12.2.1^and not be conformed to the age this, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind, for - to prove by you, what is the will - of god, - good and well-pleasing and perfect.
45.12.3.1^i say for through the grace - having been given to me to everyone - being among you, not to be high-minded above what it behooves you to think, but to think so as - to be sober-minded, to each as - god has allotted a measure of faith.
45.12.4.1^just as for, in one body many members we have, - now the members all not the same have function;
45.12.5.1^so the many, one body we are in christ;
45.12.5.2^- and individually one of another members.
45.12.6.1^we are having however gifts according to the grace - having been given to us different:
45.12.6.2^if prophecy, according to the proportion of the faith;
45.12.7.1^or service, in the service;
45.12.7.2^or - teaching, in the teaching;
45.12.8.1^or - exhorting, in the exhortation;
45.12.8.2^- giving, in generosity;
45.12.8.3^- leading, with diligence;
45.12.8.4^- showing mercy, with cheerfulness.
45.12.9.1^let love be unfeigned:
45.12.9.2^abhorring - evil, cleaving to - good,
45.12.10.1^- in brotherly love to one another devoted - in honor, one another esteeming,
45.12.11.1^- in diligence not lagging, - in spirit being fervent, the lord serving,
45.12.12.1^- in hope rejoicing, - in tribulation being patient, - in prayer being constant,
45.12.13.1^to the needs of the saints contributing, - hospitality pursuing.
45.12.14.1^bless those persecuting you.
45.12.14.2^bless and not curse;
45.12.15.1^to rejoice with the rejoicing, to weep with the weeping;
45.12.16.1^the same thing toward one another minding, not the things haughty minding, but with the lowly going along.
45.12.16.2^not be wise in yourselves.
45.12.17.1^to no one evil for evil repaying, providing right before all men;
45.12.18.1^if possible - of you, with all men living at peace;
45.12.19.1^never yourselves avenging, beloved;
45.12.19.2^instead give place - to wrath;
45.12.19.3^it has been written for:
45.12.19.4^mine is vengeance, i will repay, says the lord.
45.12.20.1^on the contrary, if should hunger the enemy of you, feed him;
45.12.20.2^if he should thirst, give drink him;
45.12.20.3^this for doing, coals of fire you will heap upon the head of him.
45.12.21.1^not be overcome by - evil, but overcome with - good - evil.
45.13.1.1^every soul to the authorities being above him let be subject.
45.13.1.2^not for there is authority, if not by god;
45.13.1.3^those however existing, by god having been instituted are.
45.13.2.1^therefore the one resisting the authority, the - of god ordinance has resisted;
45.13.2.2^those now having resisted upon themselves judgment will bring.
45.13.3.1^the for rulers not are a terror - to good works, but - to evil.
45.13.3.2^do you desire now not to fear the authority?
45.13.3.3^the good do, and you will have praise from him.
45.13.4.1^of god for servant he is to you for - good.
45.13.4.2^if however - evil you do, be afraid, not for in vain the sword he bears;
45.13.4.3^of god for a servant he is, an avenger for wrath to the one - evil doing.
45.13.5.1^therefore necessary it is to be subject, not only on account of the wrath, but also on account of the conscience.
45.13.6.1^because of this for, also taxes pay you;
45.13.6.2^servants for of god they are, upon this very thing attending continually.
45.13.7.1^render to all their dues, to whom the tax, the tax;
45.13.7.2^to whom the revenue, the revenue;
45.13.7.3^to whom the respect, the respect;
45.13.7.4^to whom the honor, the honor.
45.13.8.1^to no one nothing owe, if not - one another to love;
45.13.8.2^the one for loving the other, the law has fulfilled.
45.13.9.1^- for, not you shall commit adultery, not you shall murder, not you shall steal, not you shall covet,  and if any other commandment, in the word this it is summed up, in the saying:
45.13.9.2^you shall love the neighbor of you as yourself.
45.13.10.1^- love to the neighbor evil not does do;
45.13.10.2^the fulfillment therefore of the law - love is.
45.13.11.1^and this, knowing the time, that it is the hour already for you out of sleep to awaken;
45.13.11.2^now for nearer is of us the salvation than when first we believed.
45.13.12.1^the night is nearly over, - and the day has drawn near.
45.13.12.2^we should cast off therefore the works - of darkness;
45.13.12.3^we should put on now the armor - of light.
45.13.13.1^as in daytime, properly we should walk, not in reveling and drinking, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in dissension and jealousy.
45.13.14.1^but put on the lord jesus christ, and of the flesh provision not make for desires.
45.14.1.1^the one now being weak in the faith, receive, not for passing judgment on reasonings.
45.14.2.1^one indeed believes to eat all things;
45.14.2.2^the one however being weak, vegetables eats.
45.14.3.1^the one eating, the one not eating not let him despise;
45.14.3.2^the one now not eating, him eating not let him judge, - god for him has received.
45.14.4.1^you who are, - judging another s servant?
45.14.4.2^to the own master he stands or falls.
45.14.4.3^he will be upheld however;
45.14.4.4^able is for the lord to uphold him.
45.14.5.1^one truly for judges a day to be above another day;
45.14.5.2^one however judges every day alike.
45.14.5.3^each in the own mind, let be fully assured.
45.14.6.1^the one regarding the day, to the lord regards it;
45.14.6.2^and the one eating, to the lord eats, he gives thanks for - to god;
45.14.6.3^and the one not eating, to the lord not he eats, and he gives thanks - to god.
45.14.7.1^no one for of us to himself lives, and no one to himself dies.
45.14.8.1^if both for we should live, to the lord we live;
45.14.8.2^if also we should die, to the lord we die.
45.14.8.3^if both therefore we should live, if also we should die, the lord s we are.
45.14.9.1^unto this for, christ died and lived again, that both the dead and living he might rule over.
45.14.10.1^you however, why judge you the brother or you, or also you why do despise the brother of you?
45.14.10.2^all for we will stand before the judgment seat of god.
45.14.11.1^it has been written for:
45.14.11.2^live i, says the lord, that to me will bow every knee, and every tongue will confess - to god.
45.14.12.1^so then, each of us concerning himself, account will give - to god.
45.14.13.1^no longer therefore one another should we judge;
45.14.13.2^but this determine rather, - not to put any stumbling block before your brother, or snare.
45.14.14.1^i know and i am persuaded in the lord jesus that nothing is unclean of itself;
45.14.14.2^if not to him reckoning anything unclean to be, to that one unclean it is.
45.14.15.1^if for on account of food, the brother of you is grieved, no longer according to love are you walking.
45.14.15.2^not with the food of you that one destroy, for whom christ died.
45.14.16.1^not let be spoken of as evil, therefore, your - good.
45.14.17.1^not for is the kingdom - of god eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the spirit holy.
45.14.18.1^the one for in these things serving - christ is well-pleasing - to god and approved - by men.
45.14.19.1^so then, the things - of peace we should pursue, and the things - for edification - among each other.
45.14.20.1^not for the sake of food, destroy the work - of god.
45.14.20.2^all things indeed are clean, but it is wrong to the man - through a stumbling block eating.
45.14.21.1^it is good - neither to eat meat, nor to drink wine, nor anything in which the brother of you stumbles.
45.14.22.1^you the faith that have, to yourself keep before - god.
45.14.22.2^blessed is the one not judging himself in what he approves.
45.14.23.1^the one however doubting, if he eats, has been condemned, because it is not of faith;
45.14.23.2^everything now that is not of faith, sin is.
45.15.1.1^we ought now, we who are strong, the weaknesses of the weak to bear, and not ourselves to please.
45.15.2.1^each of us the neighbor let please, unto the good, for edification.
45.15.3.1^even for - christ not himself pleased, but as it has been written:
45.15.3.2^the reproaches of those reproaching you have fallen on me.
45.15.4.1^whatever for was written in the past, for - our instruction was written, so that through - endurance and through the encouragement of the scriptures, - hope we might have.
45.15.5.1^the now god - of endurance and - encouragement, may he give you the same to be of mind with one another, according to christ jesus,
45.15.6.1^so that with one accord, with one mouth, you may glorify the god and father of the lord of us jesus christ.
45.15.7.1^therefore receive one another as also - christ received you, to the glory - of god.
45.15.8.1^i say for, christ a servant to have become of the circumcision for the truth of god, in order - to confirm the promises given to the fathers,
45.15.9.1^- and for the gentiles, for mercy, to glorify - god, as it has been written:
45.15.9.2^because of this i will praise you among the gentiles, and to the name of you will i sing.
45.15.10.1^and again it says:
45.15.10.2^rejoice you gentiles, with the people of him.
45.15.11.1^and again:
45.15.11.2^praise all the gentiles, the lord;
45.15.11.3^and praise him, all the peoples.
45.15.12.1^and again, isaiah says:
45.15.12.2^there will be the root - of jesse, and the one arising to rule over gentiles;
45.15.12.3^in him the gentiles will hope.
45.15.13.1^- and the god - of hope may fill you with all joy and peace, in - believing;
45.15.13.2^for - to abound you in - hope in the power of the spirit holy.
45.15.14.1^i am persuaded now, brothers of me, also myself i concerning you, that also you yourselves full are of goodness, being filled with all - knowledge, being able also one another to admonish.
45.15.15.1^more boldly however i have written to you, in part, as reminding you, because of the grace - having been given to me by - god
45.15.16.1^for - to be me a minister christ of jesus to the gentiles, administering the sacred service of the gospel - of god, so that might become the offering of the gentiles acceptable, having been sanctified in the spirit holy.
45.15.17.1^i have therefore the boasting in christ jesus, in the things pertaining to - god.
45.15.18.1^not for will i dare anything to speak of, what except has accomplished christ through me, unto the obedience of the gentiles, by word and deed,
45.15.19.1^in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the spirit of god;
45.15.19.2^so as for me from jerusalem, and around unto - illyricum, to have fully proclaimed the gospel - of christ,
45.15.20.1^thus now being ambitious to preach the gospel not where had been named christ, so that not upon another s foundation i might build.
45.15.21.1^rather, as it has been written:
45.15.21.2^to whom not it was proclaimed concerning him;
45.15.21.3^they will see, and those that not have heard will understand.
45.15.22.1^therefore also i have been hindered - many times - to come to you.
45.15.23.1^now however, no longer a place having in the regions these, a great desire now having had - to come to you for many years,
45.15.24.1^whenever - i may go to - spain i hope for going through to see you, and by you to be equipped there, if of you first in part i should be filled.
45.15.25.1^now however i am going to jerusalem, ministering to the saints.
45.15.26.1^were pleased for macedonia and achaia a contribution certain to make for the poor among the saints - in jerusalem.
45.15.27.1^they were pleased for, and debtors they are of them.
45.15.27.2^if for the things spiritual of them have shared in the gentiles, they ought also in the material things to minister to them.
45.15.28.1^this therefore having finished and having sealed to them the fruit this, i will set off through you into spain.
45.15.29.1^i know now that coming to you, in the fullness of the blessing of christ i will come.
45.15.30.1^i exhort now you, brothers, by the lord of us jesus christ and by the love of the spirit, to strive together with me in the prayers for me to - god,
45.15.31.1^so that i may be delivered from those refusing to be persuaded in - judea, and the service of me, which is in jerusalem, acceptable to the saints may be,
45.15.32.1^so that in joy, having come to you by the will of god, i may be refreshed with you.
45.15.33.1^- and the god - of peace be with all of you.
45.15.33.2^amen.

46.1.20.4^not has made foolish - god the wisdom of the world?
46.1.21.1^since for in the wisdom - of god, not knew the world through the wisdom - god, was pleased - god, through the foolishness of the proclamation, to save those believing.
46.1.22.1^seeing that both jews signs ask for, and greeks wisdom seek,
46.1.23.1^we however preach christ having been crucified, to the jewish indeed a stumbling block, to gentiles now foolishness;
46.1.24.1^to them however the called, jews both and greeks, christ of god the power and of god the wisdom.
46.1.25.1^for the foolishness - of god wiser - than men is, and the weakness - of god stronger - than men.
46.1.26.1^consider for the calling of you, brothers, that not many wise according to flesh were, not many powerful, not many of noble birth.
46.1.27.1^but the foolish things of the world has chosen - god that he might shame the wise;
46.1.27.2^and the weak things of the world chose - god that he might shame the strong;
46.1.28.1^and the low-born of the world, and the things being despised, chose - god, also the things not being, that the things being he might annul,
46.1.29.1^so that not might boast all flesh before - god.
46.1.30.1^out of him however, you are in christ jesus, who has been made wisdom unto us from god, righteousness and also sanctification and redemption,
46.1.31.1^in order that, as it has been written:
46.1.31.2^the one boasting, in the lord let him boast.
46.2.1.1^and i, having come to you, brothers, came not according to excellency of speech, or wisdom, proclaiming to you the mystery - of god.
46.2.2.1^nothing for i decided anything to know among you, if not jesus christ, and him having been crucified.
46.2.3.1^and i, in weakness, and in fear, and in trembling much, was with you.
46.2.4.1^and the message of me and the preaching of me were not in persuasive of wisdom words, but in demonstration of the spirit and of power,
46.2.5.1^so that the faith of you not might be in wisdom of men, but in power of god.
46.2.6.1^wisdom however we speak among the mature;
46.2.6.2^wisdom however, not the age of this, nor of the rulers the age of this, who are coming to naught.
46.2.7.1^but we speak of god wisdom in a mystery, - having been hidden, which foreordained - god before the ages for glory of us,
46.2.8.1^which none of the rulers the age of this has understood;
46.2.8.2^if for they had understood it, not - the lord - of glory they would have crucified,
46.2.9.1^but as it has been written:
46.2.9.2^what eye not has seen, and ear not has heard, and into heart of man not has entered, what has prepared - god for those loving him.
46.2.10.1^to us for has revealed it - god through the spirit.
46.2.10.2^the for spirit all things searches, even the depths - of god.
46.2.11.1^who for knows among men the things of the man, if not the spirit of the man that is within him?
46.2.11.2^so also the things - of god no one knows, if not the spirit - of god.
46.2.12.1^we now, not the spirit of the world have received, but the spirit who is from - god, that we may know the things by - god having been granted to us,
46.2.13.1^which also we speak, not in taught of human wisdom words, but in those taught of the spirit, by spiritual means spiritual things communicating.
46.2.14.1^the natural however man not accepts the things of the spirit - of god;
46.2.14.2^foolishness for to him they are, and not he is able to understand them, because spiritually they are discerned.
46.2.15.1^he who is however spiritual judges - all things he himself, however by no one is judged.
46.2.16.1^who for has known the mind of the lord?
46.2.16.2^who will instruct him?
46.2.16.3^we however the mind of christ have.
46.3.1.1^and i brothers not was able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to infants in christ.
46.3.2.1^milk you i gave to drink, not solid food, not yet for were you able.
46.3.2.2^in fact, not still now are you able;
46.3.3.1^still for fleshly you are.
46.3.3.2^where for are among you jealousy and strife, not fleshly are you, and according to man are walking?
46.3.4.1^when for might say one, i indeed am of paul, another however, i of apollos, not fleshly are you?
46.3.5.1^who then is apollos?
46.3.5.2^who now is paul?
46.3.5.3^servants through whom you believed, also to each as the lord has given?
46.3.6.1^i planted, apollos watered, but - god kept it growing.
46.3.7.1^so neither the one planting is anything, nor the one watering, but only the one giving growth   god.
46.3.8.1^the one planting now and the one watering, one are;
46.3.8.2^each now the own reward will receive, according to the own labor.
46.3.9.1^of god for we are fellow workers;
46.3.9.2^god s field, god s building you are.
46.3.10.1^according to the grace - of god - having been given to me, as a wise master builder the foundation i have laid;
46.3.10.2^another however is building upon it.
46.3.10.3^each one however let take heed how he builds upon it.
46.3.11.1^foundation for another, no one is able to lay, besides the one being already laid, which is jesus christ.
46.3.12.1^if now anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, stones precious, wood, hay, straw,
46.3.13.1^of each the work manifest will become;
46.3.13.2^the for day will disclose it, because in fire it is revealed;
46.3.13.3^and of each the work, what sort it is, the fire itself will prove.
46.3.14.1^if of anyone the work will remain which he built up, a reward he will receive.
46.3.15.1^if of anyone the work will be burned up, he will suffer loss;
46.3.15.2^he himself however will be saved, so however as through fire.
46.3.16.1^not know you that temple of god you yourselves are, and the spirit - of god dwells?
46.3.16.2^in you
46.3.17.1^if anyone the temple - of god destroys, will destroy him - god;
46.3.17.2^- for the temple - of god holy is, which are you.
46.3.18.1^no one himself let deceive;
46.3.18.2^if anyone thinks himself wise to be among you in the age this, foolish let him become, so that he may become wise.
46.3.19.1^the for wisdom of the world this, foolishness with - god is.
46.3.19.2^it has been written for:
46.3.19.3^he is the one catching the wise in the craftiness of them.
46.3.20.1^and again, the lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.
46.3.21.1^therefore no one let boast in men.
46.3.21.2^all things for of you are,
46.3.22.1^whether paul, or apollos, or cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come  all yours,
46.3.23.1^you now of christ, christ now of god.
46.4.1.1^so us, let regard a man as servants of christ and stewards of the mysteries of god.
46.4.2.1^in this case moreover, it is required in the stewards, that faithful one shall be found.
46.4.3.1^me however to the smallest matter it is, that by you i be examined, or by a human court.
46.4.3.2^in fact neither myself do i examine.
46.4.4.1^nothing for against myself i am conscious of, yet not by this have i been justified;
46.4.4.2^the one however judging me the lord is.
46.4.5.1^so then, not before the time anything judge, until - shall have come the lord, who both will bring to light the hidden things - of darkness, and will make manifest the motives of the hearts;
46.4.5.2^and then the praise will come to each from - god.
46.4.6.1^these things now, brothers, i have applied to myself and apollos on account of you, so that in us you may learn -, not beyond what has been written, that not one for - one you be puffed up over the other.
46.4.7.1^who for you makes different?
46.4.7.2^what now have you which not you did receive?
46.4.7.3^if now also you did receive it, why boast you as not having received it?
46.4.8.1^already satiated you are;
46.4.8.2^already you have been enriched;
46.4.8.3^apart from us you reigned, and i wish that really you did reign, so that also we you might reign with.
46.4.9.1^i think for, - god us - apostles last has exhibited, as appointed to death, because a spectacle we have become to the world, both to angels and to men.
46.4.10.1^we are fools on account of christ, you however wise in christ;
46.4.10.2^we weak, you however strong;
46.4.10.3^you honored, we however without honor.
46.4.11.1^as far as the present hour, both we hunger and thirst, and are poorly clad, and are buffeted, and wander homeless,
46.4.12.1^and we toil, working with our own hands.
46.4.12.2^being reviled, we bless;
46.4.12.3^being persecuted, we endure;
46.4.13.1^being slandered, we entreat.
46.4.13.2^as the scum of the earth we have become, of all the refuse, until now.
46.4.14.1^not shaming you do i write these things, but as children my beloved, admonishing you.
46.4.15.1^if for ten thousand guardians you should have in christ, yet not many fathers;
46.4.15.2^in for christ jesus, through the gospel, i you have begotten.
46.4.16.1^i exhort therefore you, imitators of me become.
46.4.17.1^on account of this i sent to you timothy, who is my child, beloved and faithful in the lord, who you will remind of the ways of me that are in christ jesus, as everywhere in every church i teach.
46.4.18.1^as to not coming now of me to you, have become puffed up some.
46.4.19.1^i will come however shortly to you, if the lord wills, and i will find out not the talk of those being puffed up, but the power.
46.4.20.1^not for in word the kingdom - of god is, but in power.
46.4.21.1^what desire you?
46.4.21.2^with a rod i should come to you, or in love, a spirit then of gentleness?
46.5.1.1^actually is reported among you sexual immorality, and such sexual immorality as not even among the pagans, so as for the wife one of the father to have.
46.5.2.1^and you puffed up are, and not rather have mourned, so that might be taken out of midst of you the one the deed this having done!
46.5.3.1^i indeed, though being absent - in body, being present now - in spirit, already have judged as being present the one so this having produced,
46.5.4.1^in the name of the lord our jesus having been gathered together you, and - of me in spirit, with the power of the lord of us jesus,
46.5.5.1^to deliver - such a one - to satan for destruction of the flesh, so that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord.
46.5.6.1^not good is the boasting of you.
46.5.6.2^not know you that a little leaven all the lump leavens?
46.5.7.1^cleanse out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, as you are, unleavened.
46.5.7.2^also for the passover lamb of us has been sacrificed, christ,
46.5.8.1^so that we might celebrate the feast, not with leaven old, not with leaven of malice and wickedness, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and of truth.
46.5.9.1^i wrote to you in the letter not to associate with the sexually immoral,
46.5.10.1^not altogether with the sexually immoral the world of this, or with the covetous and swindlers, or idolaters   since you would need then from the world to depart.
46.5.11.1^now however, i wrote to you not to associate with him if anyone a brother being designated, he is sexually immoral or a coveter, or an idolater or verbal abuser, or a drunkard, or swindler   with such a one not even to eat.
46.5.12.1^what for is it to me those outside to judge?
46.5.12.2^not those within you do judge?
46.5.13.1^those however outside - god will judge.
46.5.13.2^expel the evil out from yourselves that.
46.6.1.1^dare anyone of you, a matter having against the other, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?
46.6.2.1^or not know you that the saints the world will judge?
46.6.2.2^and if by you is to be judged the world, unworthy are you of cases of the smallest?
46.6.3.1^not know you that angels we will judge?
46.6.3.2^- how much more the things of this life?
46.6.4.1^the things of this life indeed so, judgment as to if you have, the ones being despised in the church, those set you up!
46.6.5.1^for shame to you i say this.
46.6.5.2^thus not is there among you no one, a wise man, who will be able to decide in between the brother of him?
46.6.6.1^instead, brother against brother goes to law, and this before unbelievers!
46.6.7.1^already indeed therefore altogether a defeat for you it is, that lawsuits you have among one another.
46.6.7.2^because of why not rather suffer wrong?
46.6.7.3^because of why not rather be defrauded?
46.6.8.1^but you do wrong and defraud, and these things to brothers!
46.6.9.1^or not know you that the unrighteous ones of god the kingdom not will inherit?
46.6.9.2^not be deceived:
46.6.9.3^neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals,
46.6.10.1^nor thieves, nor coveters, not drunkards, nor verbal abusers, nor swindlers, the kingdom of god will inherit.
46.6.11.1^and such some of you were;
46.6.11.2^but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified, in the name of the lord jesus christ and by the spirit of the god of us.
46.6.12.1^all things to me are lawful, but not all things do profit.
46.6.12.2^all things to me are lawful, but not i will be mastered by anything.
46.6.13.1^the foods for the belly and the belly the for foods, - but god both this and these will destroy;
46.6.13.2^- and the body is not - for sexual immorality, but for the lord, and the lord for the body.
46.6.14.1^- and god both the lord has raised up, and us will raise out, by the power of him.
46.6.15.1^not know you that the bodies of you members of christ are?
46.6.15.2^having taken then the members of the christ, shall i make them of a prostitute members?
46.6.15.3^never may it be!
46.6.16.1^or not know you that the one being joined to the prostitute, one body is?
46.6.16.2^will become,  for it says, the two into flesh one.
46.6.17.1^the one however being joined to the lord, one spirit is.
46.6.18.1^flee - sexual immorality.
46.6.18.2^every sin, whatever if might do a man, outside the body is;
46.6.18.3^the one however sinning sexually, against the own body sins.
46.6.19.1^or not know you that the body of you a temple of the in you holy spirit is, whom you have from god?
46.6.19.2^and not you are your own,
46.6.20.1^you were bought for with a price;
46.6.20.2^glorify therefore - god in the body of you.
46.7.1.1^concerning now the things about which you wrote:
46.7.1.2^it is good for a man a woman not to touch.
46.7.2.1^because of however - sexual immorality, each man the own of him wife let have, and each woman the own husband let have.
46.7.3.1^to the wife, the husband the duty let fulfill;
46.7.3.2^likewise now also, the wife to the husband.
46.7.4.1^the wife, the own body not has authority over, but the husband;
46.7.4.2^likewise now, also the husband of the own body not has authority over, but the wife.
46.7.5.1^not deprive one another, if not - by mutual agreement, for a time, that you might be at leisure - for prayer;
46.7.5.2^and again, together the same be, so that not may tempt you - satan, through the lack of self-control of you.
46.7.6.1^this now i say by way of concession, not by way of command.
46.7.7.1^i wish now all men to be like even myself.
46.7.7.2^but each his own has gift from god;
46.7.7.3^one has indeed this, one however that.
46.7.8.1^i say now to the unmarried and to the widows, it is good for them if they should remain as even i.
46.7.9.1^if however not they have self-control, let them marry;
46.7.9.2^better for it is to marry than to burn with passion.
46.7.10.1^to those now having married i give this charge   not i, but the lord   a wife from a husband not is to be separated;
46.7.11.1^if however indeed she is separated, let her remain unmarried, or to the husband be reconciled;
46.7.11.2^and a husband a wife not is to send away.
46.7.12.1^to the now rest i say   i not the lord:
46.7.12.2^if any brother a wife has unbelieving, and she consents to dwell with him, not let him divorce her.
46.7.13.1^and a woman if any has a husband unbelieving, and he consents to dwell with her, not let her divorce the husband.
46.7.14.1^is sanctified for the husband - unbelieving, in the wife;
46.7.14.2^and is sanctified the wife - unbelieving, in the husband;
46.7.14.3^else then the children of you unclean are;
46.7.14.4^now however holy they are.
46.7.15.1^if however the unbeliever separates himself, let him separate himself;
46.7.15.2^not is under bondage the brother or the sister in - such cases.
46.7.15.3^into however peace has called you - god.
46.7.16.1^how for know you, wife, if the husband you will save?
46.7.16.2^or how know you, husband, if the wife you will save?
46.7.17.1^if not to each, as has assigned the lord, to each as has called - god, so let him walk.
46.7.17.2^and thus in the churches all i prescribe.
46.7.18.1^having been circumcised anyone was called?
46.7.18.2^not let him be uncircumcised.
46.7.18.3^in uncircumcision was called anyone?
46.7.18.4^not let him be circumcised.
46.7.19.1^- circumcision nothing is, and - uncircumcision nothing is, but keeping the commandments of god.
46.7.20.1^each in the calling in which he has been called, in this let him abide.
46.7.21.1^slave being were you called, not to you let it be a care;
46.7.21.2^but if also you are able free to become, rather take advantage.
46.7.22.1^the one for in the lord having been called being a slave, a freedman of the lord is;
46.7.22.2^likewise the one free having been called, a slave is of christ.
46.7.23.1^with a price you were bought;
46.7.23.2^not become slaves of men.
46.7.24.1^each wherein that he was called, brothers, in that let him abide with god.
46.7.25.1^concerning now the virgins, a commandment of the lord not i have;
46.7.25.2^judgment however i give, as having received mercy from the lord, trustworthy to be.
46.7.26.1^i think therefore this good is, because of the present necessity, that it is good for a man - in the same manner to remain.
46.7.27.1^have you been bound to a wife?
46.7.27.2^not seek to be loosed.
46.7.27.3^have you been loosed from a wife?
46.7.27.4^not seek a wife.
46.7.28.1^if however also you shall have married, not you did sin;
46.7.28.2^and if shall have married the virgin, not she did sin;
46.7.28.3^tribulation however in the flesh will have - such;
46.7.28.4^i now you am sparing.
46.7.29.1^this now i say, brothers:
46.7.29.2^the season shortened is.
46.7.29.3^- from now on that both those having wives, as none having should be;
46.7.30.1^and those weeping, as not weeping;
46.7.30.2^and those rejoicing, as not rejoicing;
46.7.30.3^and those buying, as not possessing;
46.7.31.1^and those using the world, as not using it as their own.
46.7.31.2^is passing away for the present form of the world this.
46.7.32.1^i desire now you without concern to be.
46.7.32.2^the unmarried man cares for the things of the lord, how he should please the lord;
46.7.33.1^the one however having been married, cares for the things of the world, how he should please the wife,
46.7.34.1^and is divided.
46.7.34.2^and the woman - unmarried and - virgin, cares for the things of the lord, that she should be holy both in body and in spirit;
46.7.34.3^the one however having been married, cares for the things of the world, how she should please the husband.
46.7.35.1^this now for the of you yourselves benefit i say, not that a restraint you i might place upon, but for what is seemly and devoted to the lord, without distraction.
46.7.36.1^if however anyone to be behaving improperly to the virgin of him supposes, if she is beyond youth, and so it ought to be, what he wills let him do;
46.7.36.2^not he does sin;
46.7.36.3^let them marry.
46.7.37.1^he who however stands in the heart of him firm, not having necessity, authority however having over the own will, and this has judged, in the own heart, to keep - the virgin, well he will do.
46.7.38.1^so then also, the one marrying the own virgin, well does;
46.7.38.2^and the one not marrying, better will do.
46.7.39.1^a wife is bound for as long as time may live the husband of her;
46.7.39.2^if however shall have died the husband, free she is to whom she wills to be married, only in the lord.
46.7.40.1^more blessed however she is, if in the same manner she should remain, according to - my judgment;
46.7.40.2^i think now myself also the spirit of god to have.
46.8.1.1^concerning now the things sacrificed to idols, we know indeed all knowledge we have.
46.8.1.2^- knowledge puffs up, - but love builds up.
46.8.2.1^if anyone thinks to have known anything, not yet does he know as it is necessary to know.
46.8.3.1^if however anyone loves - god, he is known by him.
46.8.4.1^concerning the eating therefore of the things sacrificed to idols, we know that nothing an idol is in the world, and that there is no god, if not one.
46.8.5.1^even truly if indeed there are those called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, as there are gods many, and lords many,
46.8.6.1^yet to us there is one god, the father, of whom are the things all, and we for him;
46.8.6.2^and one lord, jesus christ, by whom are the things all, and we through him.
46.8.7.1^but not in all is this knowledge.
46.8.7.2^some now, - by habit until now, of the idol as of a thing sacrificed to an idol eat;
46.8.7.3^and the conscience of them weak being, it is defiled.
46.8.8.1^food however us not will commend to god;
46.8.8.2^neither if not we should eat do we come short, nor if we should eat have we an advantage.
46.8.9.1^be careful however, lest somehow the right of you this an occasion of stumbling becomes to those being weak.
46.8.10.1^if for anyone sees you, - having knowledge, in an idol s temple eating, not the conscience of him weak being, will be built up, so as the things sacrificed to idols to eat?
46.8.11.1^is destroyed for the one being weak through - your knowledge, the brother for whom christ died.
46.8.12.1^thus then sinning against the brothers and wounding their - conscience being weak, against christ you sin.
46.8.13.1^therefore if food snares the brother of me, never not shall i eat meat to the age, so that not the brother of me i might snare.
46.9.1.1^not am i free?
46.9.1.2^not am i an apostle?
46.9.1.3^not jesus the lord of us have i seen?
46.9.1.4^not the work of me, you are, in the lord.
46.9.2.1^if to others not i am an apostle, yet at least to you i am;
46.9.2.2^the for seal of my the apostleship, you are in the lord.
46.9.3.1^- my defense to those me examining is this.
46.9.4.1^no not have we the right to eat and to drink?
46.9.5.1^no not have we authority a sister, a wife, to take about, as also the other apostles, and the brothers of the lord, and cephas?
46.9.6.1^or only i and barnabas, not have we authority not to work?
46.9.7.1^who serves as a soldier at his own expense at any time?
46.9.7.2^who plants a vineyard, and the fruit of it not does eat?
46.9.7.3^or who shepherds a flock, and from the milk of the flock not does drink?
46.9.8.1^not according to man, these things do i speak?
46.9.8.2^or also the law these things not says?
46.9.9.1^in for the of moses law, it has been written:
46.9.9.2^not you shall muzzle an ox treading out grain.
46.9.9.3^not for the oxen is there care - with god?
46.9.10.1^or because of us entirely is he speaking?
46.9.10.2^for sake of us for it was written, because ought in hope the one plowing to plow, and the one threshing, in hope - to partake.
46.9.11.1^if we among you - spiritual things have sown, is it a great thing if we, from you - material things will reap?
46.9.12.1^if others of the over you authority partake, should not more we?
46.9.12.2^but not we did use the right this.
46.9.12.3^instead, all things we bear, so that not any hindrance we should place to the gospel of christ.
46.9.13.1^not know you that those in the temple working, the things of the temple eat;
46.9.13.2^those at the altar attending, in the altar partake?
46.9.14.1^so also, the lord has prescribed to those the gospel proclaiming from the gospel to live.
46.9.15.1^i however not have used none of these.
46.9.15.2^neither have i written now, these things that thus it should be with me;
46.9.15.3^it were good for me rather to die, than the boasting of me, anyone will make void.
46.9.16.1^if for i preach the gospel, nothing there is to me boasting;
46.9.16.2^necessity for me is laid upon.
46.9.16.3^woe however to me be, if not i should preach the gospel.
46.9.17.1^if for willingly this i do, a reward i have;
46.9.17.2^if however unwillingly, a stewardship i am entrusted with.
46.9.18.1^what then of me is the reward?
46.9.18.2^that in preaching the gospel free of charge, i should offer the gospel, so as - not to use up the right of me in the gospel.
46.9.19.1^free for being from all, to all myself i became servant, so that the more i might gain.
46.9.20.1^and i became to the jews, like a jew, so that jews i might win.
46.9.20.2^to those under the law, as under the law not being myself under the law so that those under the law i might win.
46.9.21.1^to those outside the law, like outside the law   not being outside the law of god, but under the law to christ   so that i might win those outside the law.
46.9.22.1^i became to the weak, weak, that the weak i might win.
46.9.22.2^these things to all i have become all, so that by all means, some i might save.
46.9.23.1^all things now i do on account of the gospel, that a fellow partaker with it i might become.
46.9.24.1^not know you that those in a race course running, all indeed run;
46.9.24.2^one however receives the prize?
46.9.24.3^thus run, that you might obtain it.
46.9.25.1^everyone now - striving, in all things controls himself;
46.9.25.2^they indeed then, that a perishable crown they might receive, we however an imperishable.
46.9.26.1^i therefore thus run, as not uncertainly;
46.9.26.2^so i fight, as not the air beating.
46.9.27.1^but i batter of me the body and bring it into servitude, not hardly to others having preached, myself disqualified i might be.
46.10.1.1^not i want for you to be ignorant, brothers, that the fathers of us all under the cloud were, and all through the sea passed,
46.10.2.1^and all into - moses were baptized, in the cloud and in the sea,
46.10.3.1^and all the same spiritual food ate,
46.10.4.1^and all the same spiritual drank drink;
46.10.4.2^they were drinking for from the spiritual accompanying them rock;
46.10.4.3^the rock then was - christ.
46.10.5.1^nevertheless not with - most of them was well pleased - god;
46.10.5.2^they were strewn for in the wilderness.
46.10.6.1^these things now, types to us have become, for - not to be us desirers of evil things, as they also desired.
46.10.7.1^neither idolaters are you to be, as some of them;
46.10.7.2^as it has been written:
46.10.7.3^sat down the people to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
46.10.8.1^neither should we commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed sexual immorality, and fell in one day twenty three thousand.
46.10.9.1^neither should we test the christ, as some of them tested, and by - serpents were destroyed.
46.10.10.1^neither are you to grumble, as some of them grumbled, and perished by the destroyer.
46.10.11.1^these things now as types happened to them, were written then for admonition of us, to whom the ends of the ages are arrived.
46.10.12.1^therefore the one thinking to stand, let him take heed, lest he fall.
46.10.13.1^temptation you not has seized, if not what is common to man;
46.10.13.2^faithful now - is god, who not will allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but will provide, with the temptation, also the escape, - to be able to endure it.
46.10.14.1^therefore, beloved of me, flee from - idolatry.
46.10.15.1^as to sensible ones i speak;
46.10.15.2^judge for yourselves what i say.
46.10.16.1^the cup - of blessing that we bless, not a participation is it in the blood - of christ?
46.10.16.2^the bread that we break, not a participation in the body - of christ is it?
46.10.17.1^because there is one loaf, one body the many we are;
46.10.17.2^- for all of the one loaf we partake.
46.10.18.1^consider - israel according to flesh:
46.10.18.2^not those eating the sacrifices, fellow partakers in the altar are?
46.10.19.1^what then do i mean?
46.10.19.2^that what is sacrificed to an idol anything is, or that an idol anything is?
46.10.20.1^rather that what they sacrifice to demons and not to god they sacrifice.
46.10.20.2^not i do wish now, you fellow partakers - with demons to be.
46.10.21.1^not you are able the cup of the lord to drink, and the cup of demons.
46.10.21.2^not you are able of the table of the lord to partake, and of the table of demons.
46.10.22.1^or do we provoke to jealousy the lord?
46.10.22.2^not stronger than he are we?
46.10.23.1^all things are lawful, but not all things are profitable.
46.10.23.2^all things are lawful, but not all edify.
46.10.24.1^no one the good of himself let seek, but that of the other.
46.10.25.1^everything - in the meat market being sold, eat, nothing inquiring on account of - conscience,
46.10.26.1^the lord s,  for, is the earth, and the fullness of it.
46.10.27.1^if anyone invites you of the unbelieving, and you wish to go, everything - being set before you eat, nothing inquiring on account of - conscience.
46.10.28.1^if however anyone to you should say, this offered to an idol is, not do eat, on account of him - having shown it, and - conscience
46.10.29.1^the conscience now, i am saying, not - your own, but that of the other;
46.10.29.2^that what for the freedom of me is judged by another s conscience?
46.10.30.1^if i with thankfulness partake, why am i denounced for that which i give thanks?
46.10.31.1^whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, all things to the glory of god do.
46.10.32.1^without offense both to jews be you, and greeks, and to the church - of god
46.10.33.1^as i also all in all things please, not seeking the of myself profit, but that of the many, that they may be saved.
46.11.1.1^imitators of me be, as i also am of christ.
46.11.2.1^i commend now you that in all things me you have remembered, and as i delivered to you, the teachings you are keeping.
46.11.3.1^i want however you to know that of every man the head - christ is, the head now of the woman is the man, the head now - of christ - god.
46.11.4.1^every man praying or prophesying, anything on his head having, dishonors the head of him.
46.11.5.1^every now woman praying or prophesying, uncovered with the head, dishonors the head of her;
46.11.5.2^one for it is, and the same, - with having been shaven.
46.11.6.1^if for not covers her head a woman, also let her be shorn.
46.11.6.2^if it is now disgraceful to a woman - to be shorn or to be shaven, let her cover her head.
46.11.7.1^a man truly for not ought to cover the head, image and glory of god being;
46.11.7.2^the woman however, the glory of man is.
46.11.8.1^not for is man of woman, but woman of man.
46.11.9.1^truly for not was created man on account of the woman, but woman on account of the man.
46.11.10.1^because of this, ought the woman authority to have on the head, on account of the angels.
46.11.11.1^however, neither is woman separate from man, nor man separate from woman, in the lord.
46.11.12.1^just as for the woman of the man is, so also the man by the woman is;
46.11.12.2^the however all things of - god.
46.11.13.1^in you yourselves judge:
46.11.13.2^becoming is it for a woman revealed, - to god to pray?
46.11.14.1^not even - nature itself does teach you that a man indeed, if he has long hair, a dishonor to him it is;
46.11.15.1^a woman however if she has long hair, glory to her it is?
46.11.15.2^for the long hair instead of a covering is given to her.
46.11.16.1^if now anyone is inclined contentious to be, we such custom no other have, nor the churches - of god.
46.11.17.1^in this now instructing, not i do praise , because not for the better, but for the worse, you come together.
46.11.18.1^first indeed, for coming together you in an assembly, i hear divisions among you there to be, and in part it i believe.
46.11.19.1^it behooves for also factions among you there to be, so that also the approved, evident should become among you.
46.11.20.1^coming therefore of you together in one place, not it is the lord s supper to eat.
46.11.21.1^one for the own supper takes first in - eating;
46.11.21.2^and this one indeed is hungry, that one however is drunken.
46.11.22.1^no indeed houses not have you in which to eat and to drink?
46.11.22.2^or the church - of god do you despise and put to shame those nothing having?
46.11.22.3^what shall i say to you?
46.11.22.4^shall i praise you in this?
46.11.22.5^not i praise you!
46.11.23.1^i for received from the lord that which also i delivered to you, that the lord jesus in the night in which he was betrayed, took bread,
46.11.24.1^and having given thanks, he broke it and said, this of me is the body, which is for you;
46.11.24.2^this do in - of me remembrance.
46.11.25.1^likewise also the cup, after - having supped, saying, this - cup the new covenant is in - my blood;
46.11.25.2^this do, as often as if you might drink it, in - of me remembrance.
46.11.26.1^as often as for if you may eat the bread this, and the cup may drink, the death of the lord you proclaim until that he should come.
46.11.27.1^therefore whoever - should eat the bread or should drink the cup of the lord unworthily, guilty will be of the body and of the blood of the lord.
46.11.28.1^let examine however a man himself, and in this manner of the bread let him eat, and of the cup let him drink.
46.11.29.1^the one for eating and drinking judgment on himself, eats and drinks not discerning the body.
46.11.30.1^because of this, among you many are weak and sick, and are fallen asleep many.
46.11.31.1^if for ourselves we were judging, not - we would come under judgment.
46.11.32.1^being judged however by the lord, we are disciplined, so that not with the world we should be condemned.
46.11.33.1^so then, brothers of me, coming together in order - to eat, one another wait for.
46.11.34.1^if anyone is hungry, at home let him eat, so that not for judgment you might come together.
46.11.34.2^- and the other things, as soon as - i might come, i will set in order.
46.12.1.1^concerning now - spiritual gifts, brothers, not i do want you to be ignorant.
46.12.2.1^you know that when pagans you were, to - idols - mute, even as - you were led, being carried away.
46.12.3.1^therefore i make known to you that no one in the spirit of god speaking, says accursed is jesus, and no one is able to say, lord is jesus, if not in the spirit holy.
46.12.4.1^varieties now of gifts there are, - but the same spirit;
46.12.5.1^and varieties of services there are, but the same lord;
46.12.6.1^and varieties of workings there are, the but same god - is working the all things in everyone.
46.12.7.1^to each now is given the manifestation of the spirit for the common profiting.
46.12.8.1^to one truly for through the spirit is given a word of wisdom, to another now a word of knowledge, according to the same spirit,
46.12.9.1^and to a different one, faith by the same spirit, to another now gifts of healing in that one spirit,
46.12.10.1^to another now working of miracles, to another now prophecy, to another now distinguishing of spirits, and to a different one various kinds of tongues, to another now interpretation of tongues.
46.12.11.1^all now these things works the one and the same spirit, apportioning individually to each as he wills.
46.12.12.1^just as for the body one is, and members many has, all now the members of the body, many being, one are body;
46.12.12.2^so also is - christ.
46.12.13.1^also for in one spirit, we all into one body were baptized, whether jews or greeks, whether slaves or free;
46.12.13.2^and all one spirit we were made to drink.
46.12.14.1^also for the body not is one member, but many.
46.12.15.1^if should say the foot, because not i am a hand, not i am of the body, not on account of this, not is it of the body.
46.12.16.1^and if should say the ear, because not i am an eye, not i am of the body, not on account of this, not is it of the body.
46.12.17.1^if all the body were an eye, where would be the hearing?
46.12.17.2^if all were hearing, where would be the sense of smell?
46.12.18.1^now however, - god has arranged the members, one each of them in the body, as he desired.
46.12.19.1^if now were - all one member, where would be the body?
46.12.20.1^now however, many even are the members, one however body.
46.12.21.1^not is able now the eye to say to the hand, need of you not i have.
46.12.21.2^or again the head to the feet, need of you not i have.
46.12.22.1^but much rather, those seeming members of the body weaker to be, indispensable are;
46.12.23.1^and those which we think less honorable to be of the body, these honor more abundant we bestow;
46.12.23.2^and the unpresentable parts of us, decorum more abundant have;
46.12.24.1^- and the presentable parts of us, no need have.
46.12.24.2^but - god has composed the body, to the parts being deficient more abundant having given honor,
46.12.25.1^that not there should be division in the body, but the same for one another should have concern, the members.
46.12.26.1^and if suffers one member, suffer with it all the members;
46.12.26.2^if is honored one member, rejoice with it all the members.
46.12.27.1^you now are the body of christ, and members in particular.
46.12.28.1^and some indeed has appointed - god in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helping, administrating, various kinds of tongues.
46.12.29.1^not are all apostles?
46.12.29.2^not all prophets?
46.12.29.3^not all teachers?
46.12.29.4^not have all miracles?
46.12.30.1^not all gifts have of healings?
46.12.30.2^not all in tongues do speak?
46.12.30.3^not all do interpret?
46.12.31.1^be desirous of however the gifts - greater.
46.12.31.2^and now, according to a more surpassing way, to you i show.
46.13.1.1^if in the tongues - of men i speak, and - of angels, love however not have, i have become a brass sounding, or a cymbal clanging.
46.13.2.1^and if i should have prophecy and understand the mysteries all, and all the knowledge, and if i should have all the faith, so as mountains to remove, love however not have, nothing i am.
46.13.3.1^even if i may give away all the possessions of me, and if i may deliver up the body of me that i may boast, love however not have, nothing i am profited.
46.13.4.1^- love is patient, is kind;
46.13.4.2^- love not is envious;
46.13.4.3^- love not is boastful, not is puffed up,
46.13.5.1^not acts unbecomingly;
46.13.5.2^not seeks the things of its own, not is easily provoked, not it keeps account - of wrongs;
46.13.6.1^not delights at - unrighteousness, rejoices however in the truth.
46.13.7.1^all things it bears, all things believes, all things hopes, all things endures.
46.13.8.1^- love never fails;
46.13.8.2^if however there are prophesies, they will be done away;
46.13.8.3^if tongues, they will be ceased;
46.13.8.4^if knowledge it will pass away.
46.13.9.1^in part for we know, and in part we prophesy;
46.13.10.1^when however should come the perfect, the in part will be done away.
46.13.11.1^when i was a child, i was speaking like a child, i was thinking like a child, i was reasoning like a child;
46.13.11.2^when i became a man, i did away with the things of the child.
46.13.12.1^we see for presently, through a glass in obscurity;
46.13.12.2^then however, face to face;
46.13.12.3^presently, i know in part;
46.13.12.4^then however i will know fully, as also i have been fully known.
46.13.13.1^now however abide faith, hope, love, the things three these;
46.13.13.2^the greatest however of these is - love.
46.14.1.1^earnestly pursue - love;
46.14.1.2^earnestly desire now - spiritual gifts, especially now that you might prophesy.
46.14.2.1^the one for speaking in a tongue, not to men speaks, but to god;
46.14.2.2^no one for hears;
46.14.2.3^in the spirit however, he utters mysteries.
46.14.3.1^the one however prophesying, to men speaks for edification, and encouragement, and consolation.
46.14.4.1^the one speaking in a tongue, himself edifies;
46.14.4.2^the one however prophesying, the church edifies.
46.14.5.1^i desire now all you to speak in tongues, rather however that you should prophesy;
46.14.5.2^greater is now the one prophesying than the one speaking in tongues, except if not he should interpret, so that the church edification might receive.
46.14.6.1^now however brothers, if i should come to you in tongues speaking, what you will i profit, if not to you i should speak either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in teaching?
46.14.7.1^even - lifeless things a sound giving, whether flute or harp, if distinction to the sounds not they give, how will it be known what is being piped or - being harped?
46.14.8.1^also for if indistinct the trumpet sound gives, who will prepare himself for battle?
46.14.9.1^so also you, with the tongue if not intelligible speech you give, how will it be known what is being spoken?
46.14.9.2^you will be for into the air speaking.
46.14.10.1^so many if it may be kinds of languages there are in the world, and none without meaning.
46.14.11.1^if therefore not i know the power of the sound, i will be to the one speaking a foreigner, and the one speaking to me a foreigner.
46.14.12.1^so also you, since zealous you are of spiritual gifts, for the edification of the church, search that you should cause it to abound.
46.14.13.1^therefore the one speaking in a tongue, let him pray that he might interpret.
46.14.14.1^if for i pray in a tongue, the spirit of me prays, - but the mind of me unfruitful is.
46.14.15.1^what then is it?
46.14.15.2^i will pray with the spirit, i will pray however also with the mind.
46.14.15.3^i will sing praise with the spirit, i will sing praise however also with the mind.
46.14.16.1^otherwise if you bless with the spirit, the one filling the place of the uninstructed, how will he say the amen at - your thanksgiving, since what you say not he knows?
46.14.17.1^you truly for well are giving thanks, but the other not is edified.
46.14.18.1^i thank - god than all of you more, in tongues speaking;
46.14.19.1^but in the church, i desire five words with the mind of me to speak that also others i might instruct, rather than ten thousand words in a tongue.
46.14.20.1^brothers, not children be in the minds.
46.14.20.2^yet in the evil, be little children;
46.14.20.3^in the however thinking, full grown be.
46.14.21.1^in the law it has been written -:
46.14.21.2^by other tongues, and by lips other, i will speak to the people this, and not even thus will they hear me, says the lord.
46.14.22.1^so then - tongues for a sign are, not to those believing, but to the unbelieving;
46.14.22.2^- but prophecy is not to the unbelieving, but to the believing.
46.14.23.1^if therefore gathers the church whole together the place, and all should speak in tongues, come in however uninstructed ones or unbelievers, not will they say that you are mad?
46.14.24.1^if however all prophesy, should come in then some unbeliever or uninstructed, he is convicted by all, he is examined by all,
46.14.25.1^the secrets of the heart of him manifest become.
46.14.25.2^and thus having fallen upon his face, he will worship - god, declaring that certainly - god among you is.
46.14.26.1^what then is it, brothers?
46.14.26.2^when you may come together, each a psalm has, a teaching has, a revelation has, a tongue has, an interpretation has.
46.14.26.3^all things for edification let be done.
46.14.27.1^if with a tongue anyone speaks, let it be by two or the most three, and in turn;
46.14.27.2^and one let interpret.
46.14.28.1^if however not there is an interpreter, let him be silent in the church;
46.14.28.2^to himself then let him speak, and - to god.
46.14.29.1^prophets then, two or three let speak, and the others let discern.
46.14.30.1^if however to another a revelation should be made sitting by, the first let be silent.
46.14.31.1^you are able for one by one all to prophesy, so that all may learn and all may be exhorted.
46.14.32.1^and spirits of prophets, to prophets are subject.
46.14.33.1^not for he is of disorder the god, but of peace.
46.14.33.2^as in all the churches of the saints,
46.14.34.1^the women in the churches let them be silent.
46.14.34.2^not for it is allowed to them to speak, but to be in submission, as also the law says.
46.14.35.1^if however anything to learn they desire, at home the own husbands let them ask;
46.14.35.2^shameful for it is for a woman to speak in the church.
46.14.36.1^or from you the word - of god has gone out?
46.14.36.2^or to you only has it come?
46.14.37.1^if anyone considers a prophet himself to be, or spiritual, let him recognize the things i write to you that of the lord are the commands.
46.14.38.1^if however anyone is ignorant, let him be ignored.
46.14.39.1^so, brothers of me, earnestly desire - to prophesy, and - to speak not do forbid in tongues.
46.14.40.1^all things however properly and with order let be done.
46.15.1.1^i make known now to you, brothers, the gospel that i proclaimed to you, which also you received, in which also you stand,
46.15.2.1^by which also you are being saved, to the word i proclaimed to you, if you hold fast;
46.15.2.2^unless if not, in vain you have believed.
46.15.3.1^i delivered for to you in the foremost what also i received, that christ died for the sins of us according to the scriptures,
46.15.4.1^and that he was buried, and that he was raised the day the third according to the scriptures,
46.15.5.1^and that he appeared to cephas, then to the twelve.
46.15.6.1^thereafter he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once, of whom the greater part remain until now;
46.15.6.2^some however have fallen asleep.
46.15.7.1^then he appeared to james, then to the apostles all.
46.15.8.1^last then of all, as the untimely birth, he appeared also to me.
46.15.9.1^i for am the least of the apostles, who not am fit to be called an apostle, because i persecuted the church - of god.
46.15.10.1^by the grace however of god, i am what i am, and the grace of him - toward me not void has been.
46.15.10.2^rather, more abundantly than them all i toiled, not i however, but the grace - of god that was with me.
46.15.11.1^whether therefore i or they, thus we preach, and thus you believed.
46.15.12.1^if now christ is preached that out from the dead he has been raised, how say among you some that a resurrection of the dead not there is?
46.15.13.1^if however a resurrection of the dead not there is, neither christ has been raised;
46.15.14.1^if then christ not has been raised, is void then also the preaching of us, void also the faith of you.
46.15.15.1^we are found then also false witnesses - of god, because we have witnessed concerning - god, that he raised up - christ, whom not he has raised if then the dead not are raised.
46.15.16.1^if for the dead not are raised, neither christ has been raised;
46.15.17.1^if then christ not has been raised, is futile the faith of you still you are in the sins of you.
46.15.18.1^then also those having fallen asleep in christ have perished.
46.15.19.1^if in the life this, in christ having hope we are, only, more to be pitied than all men we are.
46.15.20.1^now however christ has been raised out from the dead, firstfruit of those having fallen asleep.
46.15.21.1^since for by a man came death, also by a man resurrection of the dead.
46.15.22.1^for as indeed in - adam all die, so also in - christ, all will be made alive.
46.15.23.1^each however in the own order:
46.15.23.2^the firstfruit christ, then those of christ at the coming of him;
46.15.24.1^then the end, when he shall hand over the kingdom to the god and father, when he shall have annulled all dominion and all authority and power.
46.15.25.1^it behooves for him to reign until that he shall have put all the enemies under the feet of him.
46.15.26.1^the last enemy to be abolished is - death.
46.15.27.1^all things,  for he has put in subjection, under the feet of him.
46.15.27.2^when however it may be said that all things have been put in subjection, it is evident that is excepted the one having put in subjection to him - all things.
46.15.28.1^when now shall have been put in subjection to him - all things, then also himself the son will be put in subjection to the one having put in subjection to him - all things, so that may be - god - all in all.
46.15.29.1^otherwise what will they do who are baptized for the dead?
46.15.29.2^if at all the dead not are raised, why also are they baptized for them?
46.15.30.1^why also, we are in danger every hour?
46.15.31.1^every day i die, as surely as the in you boasting, brothers which i have in christ jesus the lord of us.
46.15.32.1^if according to man, i fought wild beasts in ephesus, what to me the profit?
46.15.32.2^if the dead not are raised, let us eat and let us drink, tomorrow for we die.
46.15.33.1^not be misled:
46.15.33.2^do corrupt morals good, companionships bad.
46.15.34.1^sober up righteously and not sin;
46.15.34.2^ignorance for of god some have;
46.15.34.3^to the shame of you i speak.
46.15.35.1^but will say someone, how are raised the dead?
46.15.35.2^with what then body do they come?
46.15.36.1^fool you!
46.15.36.2^what you sow not does come to life, if not it dies.
46.15.37.1^and what you sow, not the body that will be you sow, but a bare grain, if it may be of wheat, or of some of the rest.
46.15.38.1^- but god gives it a body, as he has willed, and to each of the seeds, its own body.
46.15.39.1^not all flesh is the same flesh, but one indeed of men, another now flesh of beasts, another now flesh of birds, another now of fish.
46.15.40.1^and bodies there are heavenly, and bodies earthly.
46.15.40.2^but one truly is the of the heavenly glory, another now that of the earthly.
46.15.41.1^one is the glory of the sun, and another the glory of the moon, and another the glory of the stars;
46.15.41.2^star for from star differs in glory.
46.15.42.1^so also is the resurrection of the dead.
46.15.42.2^it is sown in decay, it is raised in immortality.
46.15.43.1^it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory.
46.15.43.2^it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.
46.15.44.1^it is sown a body natural, it is raised a body spiritual.
46.15.44.2^if there is a body natural, there is also spiritual.
46.15.45.1^so also it has been written:
46.15.45.2^became the first man adam into a soul living;
46.15.45.3^the last adam into a spirit life-giving.
46.15.46.1^however not first was the spiritual, but the natural, then the spiritual.
46.15.47.1^the first man was from the earth, made of dust;
46.15.47.2^the second man from heaven.
46.15.48.1^as the one made of dust, so also are those of the earth;
46.15.48.2^and as the heavenly one, so also those of heaven.
46.15.49.1^and as we have born the image of the earthly, we shall bear also the image of the heavenly.
46.15.50.1^this now i say, brothers, that flesh and blood, the kingdom of god to inherit not is able, nor the decay, the immortality does inherit.
46.15.51.1^behold, a mystery to you i tell.
46.15.51.2^all not we will sleep;
46.15.51.3^all however we will be changed
46.15.52.1^in an instant, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet.
46.15.52.2^the trumpet will sound for, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.
46.15.53.1^it behooves for the perishable this, to put on imperishable;
46.15.53.2^and the mortal this, to put on immortality.
46.15.54.1^when now the perishable this shall have put on the imperishable, and the mortal this shall have put on immortality, then will come to pass the word - having been written:
46.15.54.2^has been swallowed up - death in victory.
46.15.55.1^where of you, o death, the victory?
46.15.55.2^where of you, o death, the sting?
46.15.56.1^- and the sting - of death is - sin;
46.15.56.2^- and the power - of sin, the law;
46.15.57.1^to however god be thanks, the one giving us the victory through the lord of us jesus christ.
46.15.58.1^therefore, brothers of me beloved, steadfast be, immovable, abounding in the work of the lord always, knowing that the toil of you not is in vain in the lord.
46.16.1.1^concerning now the collection which is for the saints, as i have directed the churches - of galatia, so also you are to do.
46.16.2.1^every first of the week, each of you aside him let put, treasuring up - what if he may be prospered in, so that not when i might come then collections there should be.
46.16.3.1^when then i shall have arrived, whomever if you might approve, with letters these i will send to carry the bounty of you to jerusalem.
46.16.4.1^if then suitable it is for me also to go, with me they will go.
46.16.5.1^i will come however to you, when macedonia i shall have gone through;
46.16.5.2^macedonia for i am going through.
46.16.6.1^with you then possibly i will stay, or even i will winter, so that you me may equip, wherever if i may go.
46.16.7.1^not i want for you now in passing to see;
46.16.7.2^i hope indeed a time certain to remain with you, if the lord permits.
46.16.8.1^i will remain however in ephesus until - pentecost.
46.16.9.1^a door for to me has opened great and productive, and are opposing many.
46.16.10.1^if now comes timothy, see that without fear he might be with you;
46.16.10.2^the for work of the lord he is doing, as also i.
46.16.11.1^not anyone therefore him should despise.
46.16.11.2^equip however him in peace, so that he might come to me;
46.16.11.3^i am expecting for him, with the brothers.
46.16.12.1^concerning now apollos the brother, greatly i exhorted him that he should go to you with the brothers, and at all not was his will that now he should come;
46.16.12.2^he will come however when he shall have opportunity.
46.16.13.1^watch you;
46.16.13.2^stand firm in the faith;
46.16.13.3^act like men;
46.16.13.4^be strong.
46.16.14.1^all things of you, in love let be done.
46.16.15.1^i exhort now you, brothers, you know the house of stephanas, that it is firstfruit - of achaia, and to service to the saints, they have devoted themselves,
46.16.16.1^that also you be subject - to such as these, and to everyone - joining in the work and laboring.
46.16.17.1^i rejoice however at the coming of stephanas, and fortunatus, and achaicus;
46.16.17.2^because - your deficiency, these have filled up.
46.16.18.1^they refreshed for - my spirit and - yours.
46.16.18.2^recognize therefore - such as these.
46.16.19.1^greet you, the churches - of asia.
46.16.19.2^greet you in the lord heartily, aquila and prisca, with the at house of them church.
46.16.20.1^greet you, the brothers all.
46.16.20.2^greet one another with a kiss holy.
46.16.21.1^the greeting, the own hand of paul.
46.16.22.1^if anyone not loves the lord, let him be accursed.
46.16.22.2^marana tha!
46.16.23.1^the grace of the lord jesus be with you.
46.16.24.1^the love of me be with all you in christ jesus.
47.1.1.1^paul, apostle of christ jesus by the will of god, and timothy, the brother, to the church - of god - being in corinth, with the saints all - being in all - achaia.
47.1.2.1^grace to you and peace from god the father of us and the lord jesus christ.
47.1.3.1^blessed be the god and father of the lord of us jesus christ, the father - of compassions, and god of all comfort,
47.1.4.1^the one comforting us in all the tribulation of us, for - to be able us to comfort those in every tribulation through the comfort with which we are comforted ourselves by - god,
47.1.5.1^because as abound the sufferings of the christ toward us, thus so through - christ abounds also the comfort of us.
47.1.6.1^if however we are constricted, it is for - your comfort and salvation;
47.1.6.2^if we are encouraged, it is for - your comfort, - operating in the endurance of the same sufferings that also we suffer.
47.1.7.1^and the hope of us is steadfast for you, knowing that as partners you are of the sufferings, so also of the comfort.
47.1.8.1^not for do we want you to be ignorant brothers, as to the affliction of us - having happened in - asia, that against excessively beyond our power, we were weighed, so as to despair for us even - to live.
47.1.9.1^but we in ourselves, the sentence - of death had, in order that not trusting we should be in ourselves, but in - god, the one raising the dead,
47.1.10.1^who from such a great a death has delivered us, and will deliver us, in whom we have hope that also still he will deliver us,
47.1.11.1^joining together also of you for us by supplication, so that by many persons, for the toward us grace bestowed, through many, thanks may be given for us.
47.1.12.1^- for the boasting of us this is, the testimony of the conscience of us, that in the holiness and sincerity - of god, and not in wisdom fleshly, but in the grace of god, we have conducted ourselves in the world, more abundantly now toward you.
47.1.13.1^no for other things we write to you, other than what you read or even understand;
47.1.13.2^i hope now that to the end you will understand,
47.1.14.1^as also you have understood us in part, so that boasting of you we are, even as also you are ours, in the day of the lord of us jesus.
47.1.15.1^and with this - confidence i was planning previously to you to come, so that a second blessing of grace you might have,
47.1.16.1^and through you to pass through into macedonia, and again from macedonia to come to you, and by you to be set forward to - judea.
47.1.17.1^thus therefore purposing, not then - lightness did i use?
47.1.17.2^or what i purpose, according to flesh do i purpose, so that there should be with me - yes, yes, and - no, no?
47.1.18.1^faithful however - god is, that the word of us - to you not was yes  and no.
47.1.19.1^the - of god for son, jesus, christ the one among you by us having been proclaimed by me and silvanus and timothy, not was yes and no, but yes in him it has always been.
47.1.20.1^as many as for promises of god there are, in him is the yes.
47.1.20.2^therefore also in him the amen - to god is for glory by us.
47.1.21.1^the one now establishing us with you unto christ, and having anointed us, is god,
47.1.22.1^the one also having sealed us, and having given the pledge of the spirit in the hearts of us.
47.1.23.1^i however, as witness - god call upon - my soul, that sparing you, not yet have i come to corinth.
47.1.24.1^not that we lord it over your - faith, but fellow workers are of the joy with you;
47.1.24.2^in the for faith you stand firm.
47.2.1.1^i judged for within myself this, - not again in grief to you to come.
47.2.2.1^if for i grieve you again, who - is gladdening me, if not the one being grieved by me?
47.2.3.1^and i wrote this same thing, so that not, having come, grief i might have from those of whom it behooves me to rejoice, trusting in all you, that - my joy of all of you is.
47.2.4.1^out of for much affliction and anguish of heart i wrote to you through many tears, not that you might be grieved, but the love that you might know that i have more abundantly toward you.
47.2.5.1^if however anyone has caused grief, not me has he grieved, but in part   that not i might put it too severely   all you.
47.2.6.1^sufficient to such a one is the punishment this, which is by the majority,
47.2.7.1^so that on the contrary rather for you to forgive and to comfort him, lest perhaps - by more abundant sorrow should be overwhelmed - such a one.
47.2.8.1^therefore i exhort you to confirm toward him love.
47.2.9.1^for this indeed also did i write, so that i might know the proof of you, whether to everything obedient you are.
47.2.10.1^to whomever now anything you forgive, i also;
47.2.10.2^and for i, to whom i have forgiven, if anything i have forgiven, it is for the sake of you in the person of christ,
47.2.11.1^so that not we should be outwitted by - satan;
47.2.11.2^not for of his - schemes we are ignorant.
47.2.12.1^having come now to - troas for the gospel - of christ, also a door to me having been opened in the lord,
47.2.13.1^not i had rest in the spirit of me, in the not finding my titus the brother of me;
47.2.13.2^instead, having taken leave of them, i went out to macedonia.
47.2.14.1^to however god be thanks, the one always leading in triumph us in - christ, and the fragrance of the knowledge of him making manifest through us in every place.
47.2.15.1^for of christ a sweet perfume we are - to god in those being saved and in those perishing;
47.2.16.1^to one indeed an odor from death to death, to one now, a fragrance from life to life.
47.2.16.2^and for these things who is sufficient?
47.2.17.1^not for we are, like the many, peddling the word - of god;
47.2.17.2^but as of sincerity, but as of god, before god in christ we speak.
47.3.1.1^are we beginning again ourselves to commend?
47.3.1.2^or not we need, like some, commendatory letters to you or from you?
47.3.2.1^the letter of us you are, having been inscribed in the hearts of us, being known and being read by all men,
47.3.3.1^being revealed that you are a letter of christ, having been ministered to by us, having been inscribed not in ink but with the spirit of god the living, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of hearts human.
47.3.4.1^confidence now such we have through - christ toward - god.
47.3.5.1^not that from ourselves sufficient we are to reckon anything as of ourselves, but the sufficiency of us is of - god,
47.3.6.1^who also has made competent us as ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the spirit;
47.3.6.2^the for letter kills, - but the spirit gives life.
47.3.7.1^if now the ministry - of death, in letters having been engraved on stones, was produced in glory, so as for not to be able to look intently the sons of israel into the face of moses, on account of the glory of the face of him, which is fading,
47.3.8.1^how not more, the ministry of the spirit will be in glory?
47.3.9.1^if for in the ministry - of condemnation was glory, much more abounds the ministry - of righteousness in glory!
47.3.10.1^even for, not has been glorified that having been made glorious in this - respect, on account of the surpassing it glory.
47.3.11.1^if for that which is fading away was through glory, much more is that remaining in glory!
47.3.12.1^having therefore such hope, great boldness we use,
47.3.13.1^and not as moses would put a veil over the face of himself, for - not to look intently the sons of israel into the end of that fading away.
47.3.14.1^but were hardened the minds of them.
47.3.14.2^until for the present day, the same veil at the reading of the old covenant remains, not being lifted, which in christ is being removed.
47.3.15.1^but unto this day, when - shall be read moses, a veil over the heart of them lies.
47.3.16.1^whenever however if one shall have turned to the lord, is taken away the veil.
47.3.17.1^the now lord the spirit is;
47.3.17.2^where now the spirit of the lord is, there is freedom.
47.3.18.1^we now all, having been unveiled in face, the glory of the lord beholding as in a mirror, the same image are being transformed into, from glory to glory, even as from the lord, the spirit.
47.4.1.1^because of this, having the ministry this, as we received mercy, not we lose heart.
47.4.2.1^but we have renounced the hidden things - of shame, not walking in craftiness nor falsifying the word - of god, but - by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before - god.
47.4.3.1^if however indeed is concealed the gospel of us, to those who are perishing it is concealed,
47.4.4.1^in whom the god of the age this has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, so as for - not to beam forth the illumination of the gospel of the glory - of christ, who is the image - of god.
47.4.5.1^not for ourselves do we proclaim, but jesus christ lord;
47.4.5.2^ourselves now, servants of you, for the sake of jesus.
47.4.6.1^for it is - god, - having said, out of darkness light shall shine,  who shone in the hearts of us for the radiance of the knowledge of the glory - of god in the face of jesus christ.
47.4.7.1^we have now the treasure this in earthen vessels, that the surpassingness of the power may be - from god, and not from us,
47.4.8.1^in every way being hard pressed, but not being crushed;
47.4.8.2^being perplexed, but not despairing;
47.4.9.1^being persecuted, but not being forsaken;
47.4.9.2^being struck down, but not being destroyed;
47.4.10.1^always the death - of jesus in our body carrying around, so that also the life - of jesus in the body of us should be manifested;
47.4.11.1^always for we the living to death are being delivered on account of jesus, so that also the life - of jesus may be manifested in the mortal flesh of us.
47.4.12.1^so then, - death in us works, - but life in you.
47.4.13.1^having however the same spirit - of faith, according to that having been written:
47.4.13.2^i believed, therefore i have spoken,  also we believe, therefore also speak,
47.4.14.1^knowing that the one having raised up the lord jesus, also us through jesus will raise up and will present us with you.
47.4.15.1^- for all things are for the sake of you, so that the grace having abounded through - more and more the thanksgiving may increase to the glory - of god.
47.4.16.1^therefore not we lose heart;
47.4.16.2^but if indeed the outward of us man is being brought to decay, yet the inner of us is being renewed day and day.
47.4.17.1^the for momentary lightness - affliction of us, far surpassing to excessiveness an eternal weight of glory is producing for us,
47.4.18.1^not are looking at we the things being seen, but the things not being seen.
47.4.18.2^the things for being seen are temporary;
47.4.18.3^the things however not being seen are eternal.
47.5.1.1^we know for that if - earthly of us house, the tent, should be destroyed, a building from god we have, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
47.5.2.1^and indeed, in this we groan, the dwelling of us which is from heaven to be clothed with longing.
47.5.3.1^if indeed also having been clothed, not naked we will be found.
47.5.4.1^and for, - being in the tent, we groan, being burdened, because that not we do wish to be unclothed but to be clothed, that may be swallowed up the mortal by - life.
47.5.5.1^the one now having prepared us for very this is god, - having given to us the pledge of the spirit,
47.5.6.1^being confident therefore always and knowing that, being at home in the body, we are absent from the lord;
47.5.7.1^by faith for we walk, not by sight.
47.5.8.1^we are confident now, and are pleased, rather to be absent out of the body, and to be at home with the lord.
47.5.9.1^therefore also we are ambitious, whether being at home or being away, well-pleasing to him to be.
47.5.10.1^- for all of us to be revealed it behooves before the judgment seat - of christ, that may receive back each the things done in the body, according to what he did, whether good or evil.
47.5.11.1^knowing therefore the fear of the lord, men we persuade to god and we have been made manifest;
47.5.11.2^i hope now also in the consciences of you to have been made manifest.
47.5.12.1^not again ourselves are we commending to you, but occasion are giving to you of boasting on behalf of us, so that you may have an answer toward those in appearance boasting, and not in the heart.
47.5.13.1^if for we are beside ourselves, it is to god;
47.5.13.2^or if we are sober-minded it is for you.
47.5.14.1^the for love - of christ compels us, having concluded this, that one for all has died, therefore - all have died.
47.5.15.1^and for all he died, that those living, no longer to themselves should live, but to the one for them having died and having been raised again.
47.5.16.1^therefore we from - now no one regard according to the flesh.
47.5.16.2^though even we have regarded according to flesh christ, yet now no longer we regard him thus.
47.5.17.1^therefore if anyone is in christ, he is a new creation.
47.5.17.2^the old things have passed away;
47.5.17.3^behold, has come into being the new.
47.5.18.1^- and all things are of - god, the one having reconciled us to himself through christ, and having given to us the ministry - of reconciliation,
47.5.19.1^how that god was in christ the world reconciling to himself, not reckoning to them the trespasses of them, and having put into us the word - of reconciliation.
47.5.20.1^for christ therefore we are ambassadors, as though - god is beseeching through us.
47.5.20.2^we implore on behalf of christ:
47.5.20.3^be reconciled - to god.
47.5.21.1^the one not having known sin, for us sin he made, so that we might become the righteousness of god in him.
47.6.1.1^working together now also we exhort not in vain the grace - of god to receive you.
47.6.2.1^he says for:
47.6.2.2^in a time acceptable i listened to you, and in a day of salvation i helped you.
47.6.2.3^behold, now is the time of favor;
47.6.2.4^behold, now is the day of salvation.
47.6.3.1^nothing before no one placing an obstacle, so that not should be blemished the ministry,
47.6.4.1^rather, in everything, we are commending ourselves as god s servants, in endurance great, in tribulations, in hardships, in distresses,
47.6.5.1^in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;
47.6.6.1^in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the spirit holy, in love genuine;
47.6.7.1^in the word of truth, in the power of god;
47.6.7.2^with the weapons - of righteousness for the right hand and for the left;
47.6.8.1^through glory and dishonor, through bad report and good report;
47.6.8.2^as imposters, and yet true;
47.6.9.1^as being unknown, and yet being well-known;
47.6.9.2^as dying, and yet behold, we live;
47.6.9.3^as being disciplined, and yet not being killed;
47.6.10.1^as being sorrowful, always yet rejoicing;
47.6.10.2^as poor, many yet enriching;
47.6.10.3^as nothing having, and yet all things possessing.
47.6.11.1^the mouth of us has been opened to you, corinthians;
47.6.11.2^the heart of us has been expanded.
47.6.12.1^not you are restrained by us;
47.6.12.2^you are restrained however in the affections of you.
47.6.13.1^- now as the same recompense, as to children i speak, be expanded also you.
47.6.14.1^not become unequally yoked together with unbelievers;
47.6.14.2^what for partnership have righteousness and lawlessness?
47.6.14.3^or what fellowship light with darkness?
47.6.15.1^what now harmony christ with belial?
47.6.15.2^or what part to a believer with an unbeliever?
47.6.16.1^what now agreement the temple of god with idols?
47.6.16.2^we for the temple of god are, the living, as has said - god -:
47.6.16.3^i will dwell in them, and will walk among them;
47.6.16.4^and i will be their god, and they will be to me a people.
47.6.17.1^therefore come out from the midst of them and be separate, says the lord, and unclean nothing touch, and i will receive you.
47.6.18.1^and i will be to you for a father, and you will be to me for sons and daughters, says the lord almighty.
47.7.1.1^these therefore having - promises, beloved, we should cleanse ourselves from every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of god.
47.7.2.1^make room for us;
47.7.2.2^no one we have wronged, no one we have corrupted, no one we have exploited.
47.7.3.1^for condemnation not i speak;
47.7.3.2^i have before said for that in the hearts of us you are, for us - to die together, and to live together.
47.7.4.1^great is my boldness toward you;
47.7.4.2^great my boasting on behalf of you;
47.7.4.3^i have been filled - with encouragement;
47.7.4.4^i overabound - with joy upon all the affliction of us.
47.7.5.1^and for having come of us into macedonia, no had rest the flesh of us;
47.7.5.2^but in every way we are being pressed:
47.7.5.3^on the outside conflicts, within fears.
47.7.6.1^but the one comforting the downcast comforted us, - god, by the coming of titus,
47.7.7.1^not only now by the coming of him, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted as to you;
47.7.7.2^relating to us - your earnest desire, - your mourning, - your zeal for me, so as for me the more to rejoice.
47.7.8.1^for if also i have grieved you in the letter, not i do regret it.
47.7.8.2^though even i did regret it;
47.7.8.3^i see indeed that the letter that, if even for an hour, grieved you.
47.7.9.1^now i rejoice, not that you were grieved, but that you were grieved unto repentance;
47.7.9.2^you were grieved for according to god, so that in nothing you might suffer loss through us.
47.7.10.1^the for, according to god grief, repentance to salvation without regret produces;
47.7.10.2^- and the of the world grief, death produces.
47.7.11.1^behold for, this very same thing, according to god to have been grieved, how much has produced in you earnestness, but instead reasoned defense, but indignation, but fear, but longing, but zeal, but vindication!
47.7.11.2^in everything, you have proved yourselves innocent to be in this matter.
47.7.12.1^so if even i wrote to you, it was not for the sake of the one having done wrong, nor for the sake of the one having suffered wrong, but rather for the sake of - being revealed the earnestness of you, which is for us to you before - god.
47.7.13.1^on account of this, we have been comforted.
47.7.13.2^besides now the comfort of us, the more abundantly rather we have rejoiced at the joy of titus, because has been refreshed the spirit of him by all of you.
47.7.14.1^for if anything to him about you i have boasted, not i was put to shame;
47.7.14.2^but as all things in truth we have spoken to you, so also the boasting of us - to titus, truth became.
47.7.15.1^and the affections of him more abundantly toward you are, remembering the of all of you obedience, how with fear and trembling you received him.
47.7.16.1^i rejoice that in everything i am confident in you.
47.8.1.1^we make known now to you, brothers, the grace - of god - having been bestowed among the churches - of macedonia,
47.8.2.1^that in much proof of tribulation, the abundance of the joy of them and - of deep poverty of them abounded into the riches the generosity of them.
47.8.3.1^for according to their ability, i testify that, and beyond their ability, they were willing of themselves,
47.8.4.1^with much entreaty imploring of us, for the grace and the fellowship of the service - among the saints.
47.8.5.1^and not only as we had hoped, but themselves they gave, first to the lord, and then to us, by the will of god.
47.8.6.1^accordingly - exhorted we titus, that as he had begun, so also he might complete with you as well, the grace this.
47.8.7.1^but even as in every way you abound, in faith, and speech, and knowledge, and all earnestness, and in the from us to you love, that also in this - grace you should abound.
47.8.8.1^not as a command do i speak, but through the of others earnestness, also the - of your love genuineness proving.
47.8.9.1^you know for the grace of the lord of us jesus christ, that for the sake of you he became poor, rich being, so that you - through that poverty might be enriched.
47.8.10.1^and a judgment in this matter i give, this indeed for you is profitable, who not only - to act, but also - to will, have begun from a year ago.
47.8.11.1^now then also the doing complete;
47.8.11.2^so that just as there was the readiness of the to will, so also the to complete, out of that which you have.
47.8.12.1^if for the readiness is present, as if he might have acceptable, not as not he does have.
47.8.13.1^not for that to others there may be ease but for you affliction, but of equality.
47.8.14.1^at the present time, - your abundance will be for the of those need, so that also - their abundance may be for the of you need, so that there may be equality.
47.8.15.1^as it has been written:
47.8.15.2^he the much not did abound, and he the little not had lack.
47.8.16.1^thanks however - to god, the one putting the same earnestness for you into the heart of titus.
47.8.17.1^for our indeed appeal he accepted, very earnest however being, of his own accord he has gone out to you.
47.8.18.1^we have sent now with him the brother whose - praise is in the gospel through all of the churches;
47.8.19.1^not only now, but also having been chosen by the churches fellow traveler of us, with - grace this that is being administered by us toward the himself of the lord glory, and readiness of us,
47.8.20.1^avoiding this, lest anyone us should blame in the abundance this - being administered by us.
47.8.21.1^we are taking great care to do for what is right, not only before the lord, but also before men.
47.8.22.1^we sent with now them the brother of us, whom we have proven in many things often earnest to be, now however much earnest by his confidence more which is in you.
47.8.23.1^whether as regards titus, he is partner my and for you a fellow worker;
47.8.23.2^or brothers our, they are apostles of the churches, the glory of christ.
47.8.24.1^- therefore the proof of the love of you and of our boasting about you, to them show in face of the churches.
47.9.1.1^concerning now for the service - for the saints, superfluous for me it is - to write to you.
47.9.2.1^i know for the readiness of you, which concerning you i boast of to macedonians, that achaia has been prepared from a year ago, and - your zeal has been provoking the greater number.
47.9.3.1^i have sent however the brothers, that not the boasting of us which is about you should be made void in the matter this, that as i have been saying, prepared you may be.
47.9.4.1^not perhaps if should come with me macedonians and find you unprepared, would be put to shame we   that not we might say you   in the confidence this.
47.9.5.1^necessary therefore i esteemed it to exhort the brothers that they should go before unto you and should complete beforehand the foreannounced blessing of you this, ready to be thus as a blessing, and not as covetousness.
47.9.6.1^this now:
47.9.6.2^the one sowing sparingly, sparingly also will reap;
47.9.6.3^and the one sowing upon blessings, upon blessings also will reap,
47.9.7.1^each as he purposes in the heart, not out of regret or of necessity;
47.9.7.2^a cheerful for giver loves - god.
47.9.8.1^able is now - god all grace to make abound to you, so that in every way, always, all sufficiency having, you may abound in every work good.
47.9.9.1^as it has been written:
47.9.9.2^he has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor, the righteousness of him abides to the age.
47.9.10.1^the one now supplying seed to him sowing and bread for food will supply and will multiply the seed for sowing of you and will increase the fruits of the righteousness of you,
47.9.11.1^in every way enriching you to all generosity, which produces, through us, thanksgiving - to god.
47.9.12.1^for the ministry of the service this not only is completely filling up the needs of the saints, but also is overflowing through many thanksgivings - to god,
47.9.13.1^through the proof of the service this, they glorifying - god at the submission of the of confession of you to the gospel - of christ and the generosity of the participation toward them and toward all;
47.9.14.1^and their supplication is for you, a longing for you on account of the surpassing grace - of god upon you.
47.9.15.1^thanks be - to god for the indescribable of him gift!
47.10.1.1^myself now i, paul, exhort you by the meekness and gentleness - of christ, who as to appearance indeed am humble among you, being absent however am bold toward you.
47.10.2.1^i implore you now that, not being present, to be bold with the confidence with which i reckon to be daring toward some - reckoning us as according to flesh walking.
47.10.3.1^in flesh for walking, not according to flesh do we wage war.
47.10.4.1^the for weapons of the warfare of us are not fleshly, but powerful - divinely to the demolition of strongholds, arguments overthrowing,
47.10.5.1^and every high thing lifting itself up against the knowledge - of god, and taking captive every thought into the obedience - of christ,
47.10.6.1^and in readiness having, to avenge all disobedience, when might have been fulfilled your - obedience.
47.10.7.1^the things according to appearance are you looking.
47.10.7.2^if anyone is persuaded in himself of christ to be, this let him reckon again within himself, that as he is of christ, so also are we.
47.10.8.1^if even for more abundantly somewhat i should boast concerning the authority of us, which has given us the lord for building you up and not for tearing down you, not i will be ashamed,
47.10.9.1^that not i might seem as if - to frighten you by means of the letters.
47.10.10.1^for the letters, indeed they say, are weighty and strong, - but the presence of the body weak, and the speech having been ignored.
47.10.11.1^this let reckon - such a one, that such as we are - in word by letters being absent, such we are also being present - in action.
47.10.12.1^not for dare we to classify or to compare ourselves with some - themselves commending;
47.10.12.2^but these by themselves, themselves measuring, and comparing themselves with themselves, not understand.
47.10.13.1^we however not into the things beyond measure will boast, but according to the measure of the area that has assigned to us - god, a measure to reach as far as also you.
47.10.14.1^not for as not reaching to you, we are overextending ourselves;
47.10.14.2^as far as for also you, we came in the gospel - of christ,
47.10.15.1^not to the things beyond measure boasting in others  labors, hope however having, increasing the faith of you, among you to be enlarged according to the area of us, to abundance,
47.10.16.1^so as that beyond you to preach the gospel, not in another s area, in things ready to boast.
47.10.17.1^the one however boasting, in the lord let him boast.
47.10.18.1^not for the one himself commending, this one is approved, but the one whom the lord commends.
47.11.1.1^i wish you were bearing with me little a in foolishness, but indeed you do bear with me.
47.11.2.1^i am jealous as to for you of god with the jealousy;
47.11.2.2^i have betrothed for you to one husband, a virgin pure to present - to christ.
47.11.3.1^i am afraid however, lest by any means as the serpent deceived eve in the craftiness of him, might be corrupted the minds of you from the simplicity and the purity - in - christ.
47.11.4.1^if indeed for the one coming, another jesus proclaims, whom not we did proclaim, or a spirit different you receive which not you did receive, or glad tidings different which not you did accept, well are you bearing with it.
47.11.5.1^i reckon for in nothing to have been inferior to those most eminent apostles.
47.11.6.1^if however, even unpolished - in speech i am, yet not - in knowledge;
47.11.6.2^but in every way, we have been made manifest in all things to you.
47.11.7.1^or a sin did i commit, myself humbling so that you might be exalted, because freely the - of god gospel i preached to you?
47.11.8.1^other churches i robbed, having received support for the toward you service.
47.11.9.1^and being present with you and having been in need, not i did burden no one;
47.11.9.2^- for the need of me completely filled up the brothers having come from macedonia, and in everything unburdensome myself to you i kept, and will keep.
47.11.10.1^is the truth of christ in me, that the boasting this not will be sealed up of mine in the regions - of achaia.
47.11.11.1^because of why?
47.11.11.2^because not i do love you?
47.11.11.3^- god knows i do!
47.11.12.1^what however i do, also i will do, so that i might cut off the opportunity of those desiring an opportunity that in what they are boasting, they might be found as also we.
47.11.13.1^- for such are false apostles, workers deceitful, disguising themselves as apostles of christ.
47.11.14.1^and no wonder;
47.11.14.2^himself for - satan masquerades as an angel of light.
47.11.15.1^it is not surprising therefore, if also the servants of him masquerade as servants of righteousness, whose - end will be according to the deeds of them.
47.11.16.1^again i say, no one me should think a fool to be;
47.11.16.2^if however - otherwise even as a fool receive me, that i also little a may boast.
47.11.17.1^what i am saying, not according to the lord am i saying, but as in foolishness, in this the confidence - of boasting.
47.11.18.1^since many boast according to the flesh, i also will boast.
47.11.19.1^gladly for you bear with - fools, wise being!
47.11.20.1^you bear it for if anyone you enslaves, if anyone devours you, if anyone takes from you, if anyone exalts himself, if anyone in the face of you strikes you.
47.11.21.1^as to dishonor i speak, as that we have been weak!
47.11.21.2^in whatever however - anyone might be daring   in foolishness i speak   am daring i also.
47.11.22.1^hebrews are they?
47.11.22.2^i also.
47.11.22.3^israelites are they?
47.11.22.4^i also.
47.11.22.5^descendants of abraham are they?
47.11.22.6^i also.
47.11.23.1^servants of christ are they?
47.11.23.2^as being beside myself i speak above measure:
47.11.23.3^i too, in labors more abundantly, in imprisonments more abundantly, in beatings above measure, in deaths often.
47.11.24.1^from the jews five times forty lashes minus one i received.
47.11.25.1^three times i was beaten with rods, once i was stoned, three times i was shipwrecked, a night and a day in the deep sea i have passed;
47.11.26.1^in journeyings often, in perils of rivers, in perils of robbers;
47.11.26.2^in perils from my own race, in perils from the gentiles;
47.11.26.3^in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness;
47.11.26.4^in perils on the sea, in perils among false brothers;
47.11.27.1^in labor and toil, in watchings often;
47.11.27.2^in hunger and thirst, in fastings often;
47.11.27.3^in cold and nakedness.
47.11.28.1^besides the things external, the pressure on me - on every day is my care for all the churches.
47.11.29.1^who is weak, and not i am weak?
47.11.29.2^who is led into sin, and not i do burn inwardly?
47.11.30.1^if to boast it behooves me, in the things of the weakness of me i will boast.
47.11.31.1^the god and father of the lord jesus knows, the one being blessed to the ages, that not i am lying.
47.11.32.1^in damascus the governor under aretas the king was guarding the city of the damascenes to seize me.
47.11.33.1^but through a window in a basket i was let down through the wall, and i escaped the hands of him.
47.12.1.1^to boast it behooves me;
47.12.1.2^not is it profitable indeed.
47.12.1.3^i will go on however to visions and revelations of the lord.
47.12.2.1^i know a man in christ, ago years fourteen   whether in the body, not i know, or out of the body, not i know, - god knows   having been caught up - such a man to the third heaven.
47.12.3.1^and i know - such a man   whether in the body or out of the body, not i know, - god knows
47.12.4.1^that he was caught up into - paradise, and he heard inexpressible words, - not being permitted to man to speak.
47.12.5.1^concerning - such a man i will boast;
47.12.5.2^concerning however myself, not i will boast, if not in the weaknesses.
47.12.6.1^if for i should desire to boast, not i will be a fool;
47.12.6.2^the truth for i will be speaking.
47.12.6.3^i refrain however, lest anyone to me should credit more than what he sees in me, or hears anyone of me,
47.12.7.1^and the surpassingness of the revelations.
47.12.7.2^therefore that not i should become conceited, was given to me a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of satan, that me he might buffet, so that not i should become conceited.
47.12.8.1^for this, three times the lord i begged, that it might depart from me.
47.12.9.1^and he said to me, suffices you the grace of me;
47.12.9.2^the for power in weakness is perfected.
47.12.9.3^most gladly therefore rather will i boast in the weaknesses of me, so that may rest upon me the power - of christ.
47.12.10.1^therefore i take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, and difficulties for christ;
47.12.10.2^when for i might be weak, then strong i am.
47.12.11.1^i have become a fool;
47.12.11.2^you me compelled.
47.12.11.3^i for ought by you to have been commended.
47.12.11.4^in no way for was i inferior to those most eminent apostles, though even nothing i am.
47.12.12.1^the indeed signs of the apostle were performed among you in all perseverance, in signs both, and wonders, and miracles.
47.12.13.1^in what for is it that you were inferior beyond the rest of the churches, if not that myself i not did burden you?
47.12.13.2^forgive me the wrong this!
47.12.14.1^behold, third time this, ready i am to come to you, and not i will burden you;
47.12.14.2^not for i seek what is yours, but you.
47.12.14.3^not for ought the children for the parents to treasure up, but the parents for the children.
47.12.15.1^i now most gladly will spend, and will be utterly spent, for the souls of you.
47.12.15.2^if more abundantly you loving, less i am loved?
47.12.16.1^be it so however, i not did burden you;
47.12.16.2^but being crafty, by trickery you i caught.
47.12.17.1^not any of whom i have sent to you, by him did i exploit you?
47.12.18.1^i urged titus to go, and sent with him the brother.
47.12.18.2^not did exploit you titus?
47.12.18.3^not in the same spirit did we walk?
47.12.18.4^not in the same steps?
47.12.19.1^all along have you been thinking that to you we have been making a defense?
47.12.19.2^before god in christ we speak, - but all things, beloved, for - your edification.
47.12.20.1^i fear for lest perhaps, having come, not such as i wish i may find you, and i might be found by you such as not you do wish;
47.12.20.2^lest perhaps quarreling, jealousy, anger, contentions, slander, gossip, conceit, disorder;
47.12.21.1^lest again having come of me, should humble me the god of me as to you, and i should mourn over many of those having before sinned and not having repented of the impurity and sexual immorality and sensuality that they have practiced.
47.13.1.1^third this time i am coming to you.
47.13.1.2^in the mouth of two witnesses or three, will be established every matter.
47.13.2.1^i have warned and i warn, as being present the second time, and being absent now those having sinned before, and the rest all, that if i come to the same again, not i will spare anyone,
47.13.3.1^since a proof you seek, - in me speaking of christ, who toward you not is weak, but is powerful among you.
47.13.4.1^and for he was crucified in weakness, yet he lives by power god s.
47.13.4.2^also for we are weak in him, but we will live with him by power god s toward you.
47.13.5.1^yourselves examine whether you are in the faith;
47.13.5.2^yourselves test.
47.13.5.3^or not do you recognize yourselves that jesus christ is in you, if not unapproved you are?
47.13.6.1^i hope now that you will know that we not are unapproved.
47.13.7.1^we pray now to - god, not to do you wrong nothing, not that we approved might appear, but that you what is right may do;
47.13.7.2^we though as unapproved might appear.
47.13.8.1^nothing for have we power any against the truth, but for the truth.
47.13.9.1^we rejoice for when we might be weak, you however strong might be.
47.13.9.2^but this also:
47.13.9.3^we pray for the of you perfection.
47.13.10.1^because of therefore these things, being absent i write, so that being present, not with severity i should treat you, according to the authority that the lord has given me, for building up and not for tearing down.
47.13.11.1^finally, brothers, rejoice!
47.13.11.2^be perfected, be exhorted, be of the same mind, be at peace.
47.13.11.3^and the god - of love and peace will be with you.
47.13.12.1^greet one another with a holy kiss.
47.13.12.2^greet you, the saints all.
47.13.13.1^the grace of the lord jesus christ, and the love of god, and the fellowship of the holy spirit, be with all of you.
48.1.1.1^paul, an apostle, not from men, nor through man, but through jesus christ, and god the father, the one having raised him out from the dead
48.1.2.1^and the with me all brothers, to the churches - of galatia:
48.1.3.1^grace to you and peace from god father of us and the lord jesus christ,
48.1.4.1^the one having given himself for the sins of us, so that he might deliver us out of the age of having come presently evil, according to the will of the god and father of us,
48.1.5.1^to whom be the glory to the ages of the ages.
48.1.5.2^amen.
48.1.6.1^i am astonished that so quickly you are deserting from the one having called you in the grace of christ, to a different gospel,
48.1.7.1^which not is another;
48.1.7.2^if not some there are who are troubling you, and are desiring to pervert the gospel - of christ.
48.1.8.1^but even if we or an angel out of heaven should preach a gospel to you contrary to what we proclaimed to you, accursed let him be!
48.1.9.1^as we have said before, even now again i say, if anyone to you is preaching a gospel contrary to what you received, accursed let him be!
48.1.10.1^presently for of men do i seek approval, or - god?
48.1.10.2^or do i seek men to please?
48.1.10.3^for if yet men i were pleasing, of christ a servant not - i would be.
48.1.11.1^i make known for to you, brothers, the gospel - having been preached by me, that not it is according to man.
48.1.12.1^neither for i from man received it, nor was i taught it, but by a revelation of jesus christ.
48.1.13.1^you have heard of for - my way of life former in - judaism, that beyond exceeding measure, i was persecuting the church - of god and was destroying it.
48.1.14.1^and i was advancing in - judaism beyond many contemporaries in the countrymen of me, more abundantly zealous being of the fathers of me traditions.
48.1.15.1^when however was pleased - god the one having selected me from the womb of mother of me, and having called me by the grace of him,
48.1.16.1^to reveal the son of him in me, that i might preach him among the gentiles, immediately not i consulted with flesh and blood,
48.1.17.1^nor did i go up to jerusalem to the before me apostles, but i went away into arabia, and again returned to damascus.
48.1.18.1^then after years, three i went up to jerusalem to make acquaintance with cephas, and i remained with him days fifteen.
48.1.19.1^other however of the apostles none i saw, if not james, the brother of the lord.
48.1.20.1^in what now i write to you, behold, before - god -, not i lie.
48.1.21.1^then i went into the regions - of syria and - cilicia.
48.1.22.1^i was then unknown - by face to the churches - of judea that are in christ.
48.1.23.1^only however hearing they were that the one persecuting us formerly, now is preaching the faith which once he was destroying.
48.1.24.1^and they were glorifying in me - god.
48.2.1.1^then after fourteen years again i went up to jerusalem with barnabas, having taken with me also titus.
48.2.2.1^i went up now according to a revelation and set before them the gospel that i proclaim among the gentiles   apart individually however to those esteemed   lest hardly in vain i should be running or have run.
48.2.3.1^but not even titus who was with me, a greek being, was compelled to be circumcised,
48.2.4.1^because of even the brought in secretly false brothers, who came in by stealth to spy out the freedom of us which we have in christ jesus, that us they will enslave,
48.2.5.1^to whom not even for an hour did we yield - in subjection, so that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.
48.2.6.1^of now those esteemed to be something   whatsoever formerly they were, not to me makes a difference;
48.2.6.2^the person - god of a man not does accept   to me for the esteemed nothing added.
48.2.7.1^but on the contrary, having seen that i have been entrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, just as peter with that of the circumcision
48.2.8.1^the one for having worked in peter for apostleship of the circumcision did also in me toward the gentiles
48.2.9.1^and having known the grace - having been given to me, james and cephas and john, those esteemed pillars to be, the right hands gave to me and barnabas, of fellowship, that we should go to the gentiles;
48.2.9.2^they however to the circumcision.
48.2.10.1^only they asked the poor that we should remember, that also i was eager the same thing to do.
48.2.11.1^when however came peter to antioch, to face his i opposed him, because condemned he stood.
48.2.12.1^before - for, came certain ones from james, with the gentiles he was eating;
48.2.12.2^when however they came, he was drawing back and was separating himself, being afraid of those of the circumcision.
48.2.13.1^and acted hypocritically with him also the rest of the jews, so that even barnabas was carried away of them by the hypocrisy.
48.2.14.1^but when i saw that not they are walking uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, i said - to peter before all, if you, a jew being, like a gentile and not like a jew live, why the gentiles do you compel to judaize?
48.2.15.1^we, by birth jews, and not of the gentiles sinners,
48.2.16.1^knowing nevertheless that not is justified a man by works of law, if not through faith from jesus;
48.2.16.2^christ even we in christ jesus have believed, that we may be justified by faith from christ, and not by works of the law;
48.2.16.3^because by works of the law not will be justified any flesh.
48.2.17.1^if however seeking to be justified in christ, have been found also we ourselves sinners, is then christ of sin a minister?
48.2.17.2^never may it be!
48.2.18.1^if for that i had torn down, these things again i build, a transgressor myself i prove.
48.2.19.1^i for, through the law to the law died, that to god i might live.
48.2.19.2^christ i have been crucified with;
48.2.20.1^i live now, no longer i;
48.2.20.2^lives however in me christ;
48.2.20.3^that which then now i live in the flesh, through faith i live, that from the son - of god, the one having loved me and having given up himself for me.
48.2.21.1^not i do set aside the grace - of god;
48.2.21.2^if for through the law righteousness is, then christ for naught died.
48.3.1.1^o foolish galatians!
48.3.1.2^who you has bewitched, whose before eyes jesus christ was publicly portrayed as having been crucified?
48.3.2.1^this only i wish to learn from you, by works of the law the spirit did you receive, or by hearing of faith?
48.3.3.1^so foolish are you?
48.3.3.2^having begun in the spirit, now in the flesh are you being perfected?
48.3.4.1^so many things did you suffer in vain, if indeed also in vain?
48.3.5.1^the one therefore supplying to you the spirit and working miracles among you, is it out of works of the law or out of hearing of faith?
48.3.6.1^so also, abraham believed - god, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.
48.3.7.1^know then that those of faith, these sons are of abraham.
48.3.8.1^having foreseen then the scripture that by faith justifies the gentiles - god, foretold the gospel - to abraham -:
48.3.8.2^will be blessed in you all the nations.
48.3.9.1^so then, those of faith are blessed along with the believing abraham.
48.3.10.1^as many as for of works of the law are, under a curse are;
48.3.10.2^it has been written for -:
48.3.10.3^cursed is everyone who not does continue all things - having been written in the book of the law, - to do them.
48.3.11.1^that now by the law no one is justified before - god is evident, because the righteous by faith will live.
48.3.12.1^- and the law not is of faith;
48.3.12.2^rather, the one having done these things will live by them.
48.3.13.1^christ us redeemed from the curse of the law, having become for us a curse, for it has been written:
48.3.13.2^cursed is everyone - hanging on a tree
48.3.14.1^so that to the gentiles the blessing - of abraham might come, in christ, jesus so that the promise of the spirit we might receive, through - faith.
48.3.15.1^brothers, according to man i am speaking.
48.3.15.2^even of man having been ratified a covenant, no one sets aside or adds thereto.
48.3.16.1^- and to abraham were spoken the promises, and to the seed of him.
48.3.16.2^not it does say, and - to seeds, as of many;
48.3.16.3^but as of one, and to the seed of you,  who is christ.
48.3.17.1^this now i say:
48.3.17.2^the covenant, having been confirmed beforehand by - god, - afterward four hundred and thirty years having come, the law not does annul, so as - to nullify the promise.
48.3.18.1^if for by the law is the inheritance, it is no longer by a promise;
48.3.18.2^- but to abraham through a promise has granted it - god.
48.3.19.1^why then the law?
48.3.19.2^- transgressions on account of, it was added, until that should have come the seed to whom promise has been made, having been ordained through angels in the hand of a mediator.
48.3.20.1^- however, a mediator of one person not is;
48.3.20.2^- but god one is.
48.3.21.1^the therefore law is contrary to the promises - of god?
48.3.21.2^never may it be!
48.3.21.3^if for had been given a law - being able to impart life, indeed from out of the law - would have emerged - righteousness;
48.3.22.1^but imprisoned the scripture things all under sin, so that the promise, by faith from jesus christ, might be given to those believing.
48.3.23.1^before - now came - faith, under the law we were held in custody, having been locked up until the being about faith to be revealed,
48.3.24.1^so that the law trainer of us has become, unto christ, so that by faith we might be justified.
48.3.25.1^having come now - faith, no longer under a trainer we are.
48.3.26.1^all for sons of god you are through - faith in christ jesus.
48.3.27.1^as many as for into christ you were baptized, christ you have put on.
48.3.28.1^neither there is jew nor greek;
48.3.28.2^neither there is slave nor free;
48.3.28.3^neither there is male and female;
48.3.28.4^all for you one are in christ jesus.
48.3.29.1^if now you are christ s, then - abraham s seed you are, according to the promise heirs.
48.4.1.1^i say now, for as long as time the heir a child is, not he differs from a slave, though owner of everything being.
48.4.2.1^instead, under guardians he is, and trustees, until the time appointed by his father.
48.4.3.1^so also we, when we were children, under the basic principles of the world were held in bondage.
48.4.4.1^when however had come the fullness of the time, sent forth - god the son of him, having been born of a woman, having been born under the law,
48.4.5.1^that those under the law he might redeem, so that the divine adoption as sons we might receive.
48.4.6.1^because now you are sons, sent forth - god the spirit of the son of him into the hearts of us, crying out, abba, - father!
48.4.7.1^so no longer you are a slave, but a son;
48.4.7.2^if now a son, also an heir through god.
48.4.8.1^but at that time indeed not knowing god, you were enslaved to those by nature not being gods;
48.4.9.1^now however, having known god, rather however having been known by god, how do you turn again to the weak and destitute principles, to which again anew to be enslaved you desire?
48.4.10.1^days you observe, and months and seasons and years.
48.4.11.1^i fear for you, lest perhaps in vain i have toiled for you.
48.4.12.1^become as i am, because i also have become as you, brothers, i implore you.
48.4.12.2^in nothing me have you wronged.
48.4.13.1^you know now that in weakness of the flesh i proclaimed the gospel to you at the first;
48.4.14.1^and the test of you in the flesh of me, not you did despise me, nor reject me with contempt;
48.4.14.2^but as an angel of god, you received me even as christ jesus.
48.4.15.1^what then the blessedness of you?
48.4.15.2^i bear witness for to you that, if possible, the eyes of you having gouged out, you would have given them to me.
48.4.16.1^so enemy of you have i become, speaking truth to you?
48.4.17.1^they are zealous after you not rightly, but to exclude you from us.
48.4.17.2^they desire so that them you might be zealous after.
48.4.18.1^good it is now to be zealous in a right thing at all times, and not only in - being present my with you.
48.4.19.1^children of me, of whom again i travail until that shall have been formed christ in you,
48.4.20.1^i was wishing indeed to be present with you presently and to change the tone of me, because i am perplexed as to you.
48.4.21.1^tell me, those under the law wishing to be, the law not you do listen to?
48.4.22.1^it has been written for that abraham two sons had, one of the slave woman and one of the free.
48.4.23.1^but the one indeed of the slave woman, according to flesh has been born;
48.4.23.2^the one but of the free, through the promise,
48.4.24.1^which things are allegorized;
48.4.24.2^these for are two covenants:
48.4.24.3^one indeed from mount sinai, unto slavery begetting, which is hagar.
48.4.25.1^- and hagar sinai mount is, in - arabia;
48.4.25.2^she corresponds now to the present jerusalem, she is in slavery for with the children of her.
48.4.26.1^- but the above jerusalem free is, who is mother of us.
48.4.27.1^it has been written for:
48.4.27.2^rejoice, o barren woman, the one not bearing;
48.4.27.3^break forth and call aloud, the one not travailing;
48.4.27.4^because many are the children of the desolate woman more, than of her having the husband.
48.4.28.1^you now, brothers, like isaac, of promise children are.
48.4.29.1^but just as at that time the one according to flesh having been born was persecuting the one born according to spirit, so also it is now.
48.4.30.1^but what says the scripture?
48.4.30.2^cast out the slave woman and the son of her;
48.4.30.3^no for not will inherit the son of the slave woman along with the son of the free.
48.4.31.1^so then, brothers, not we are of the slave woman children, but of the free.
48.5.1.1^in freedom, us christ has set free;
48.5.1.2^stand firm, therefore, and not again in a yoke of slavery entangle yourselves.
48.5.2.1^behold, i paul say to you that if you shall become circumcised, christ you nothing will profit.
48.5.3.1^i testify now again to every man being circumcised that a debtor he is all the law to keep.
48.5.4.1^you are severed from christ, whoever in the law are being justified;
48.5.4.2^from grace you have fallen away.
48.5.5.1^we for, through the spirit by faith, the hope of righteousness eagerly await.
48.5.6.1^in for christ jesus, neither circumcision any has power, nor uncircumcision;
48.5.6.2^but only faith through love working.
48.5.7.1^you were running well.
48.5.7.2^who you cut into, the truth not to obey?
48.5.8.1^this persuasion is not of the one calling you.
48.5.9.1^a little leaven whole the lump leavens.
48.5.10.1^i am confident as to you in the lord, that no other mind will you have.
48.5.10.2^the one however troubling you will bear the judgment, whoever if he might be.
48.5.11.1^i now, brothers, if circumcision still proclaim, why still am i persecuted?
48.5.11.2^in that case has been abolished the offense of the cross.
48.5.12.1^i wish also will emasculate themselves those upsetting you.
48.5.13.1^you for to freedom were called, brothers;
48.5.13.2^but not the freedom for an opportunity to the flesh.
48.5.13.3^rather through - love, serve one another.
48.5.14.1^- for the entire law in one word is fulfilled in this:
48.5.14.2^you shall love the neighbor of you as yourself.
48.5.15.1^if however one another you bite and devour, take heed, lest by one another you might be consumed.
48.5.16.1^i say now, by the spirit walk, and the desire of the flesh no not you should gratify.
48.5.17.1^the for flesh desires, against the spirit, - and the spirit against the flesh;
48.5.17.2^these for to one another are opposed, in order not that if you might wish those things you should do.
48.5.18.1^if however the spirit you are led by, not you are under the law.
48.5.19.1^evident now are the works of the flesh, which are sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality,
48.5.20.1^idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, contentions, dissensions, factions,
48.5.21.1^envyings, drunkennesses, carousing, and things like these, as to which i forewarn you, even as i warned before, that those such things doing, kingdom god s not will inherit.
48.5.22.1^- but the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
48.5.23.1^gentleness, self-control;
48.5.23.2^against things such, no there is law.
48.5.24.1^those now - of christ jesus, the flesh have crucified with its passions and - desires.
48.5.25.1^if we live by the spirit, by the spirit also we should walk.
48.5.26.1^not we should become boastful, one another provoking, one another envying.
48.6.1.1^brothers, if even should be overcome a man in some trespass, you, the spiritual ones, restore - such a one in a spirit of gentleness, considering yourself, lest also you be tempted.
48.6.2.1^one another s - burdens bear you, and thus you shall fulfill the law - of christ.
48.6.3.1^if for thinks himself anyone to be something, nothing being, he deceives himself.
48.6.4.1^- but the work of himself test each, and then as to himself alone, the ground of boasting he will have, and not as to - another.
48.6.5.1^each for - his own load shall bear.
48.6.6.1^let share now the one being taught in the word, with the one teaching, in all good things.
48.6.7.1^not be misled;
48.6.7.2^god not is mocked.
48.6.7.3^whatever for if might sow a man, that also he will reap.
48.6.8.1^for the one sowing to the flesh of himself, from the flesh will reap decay.
48.6.8.2^the one however sowing to the spirit, from the spirit will reap life eternal.
48.6.9.1^- and in well doing, not we should grow weary;
48.6.9.2^in time for due, we will reap a harvest not giving up.
48.6.10.1^so then, as occasion we have, we should work - good toward all, especially now toward those of the household of the of faith.
48.6.11.1^see in how large to you letters i have written with my own hand.
48.6.12.1^as many as wish to have a fair appearance in the flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, only that for the cross - of christ not they might be persecuted.
48.6.13.1^not even for those being circumcised themselves the law keep, but they desire you to be circumcised, so that in - your flesh they may boast.
48.6.14.1^for me however, never may it be to boast, if never in the cross of the lord of us jesus christ, through which to me the world has been crucified, and i to the world.
48.6.15.1^neither for circumcision anything is, nor uncircumcision;
48.6.15.2^instead a new creation.
48.6.16.1^and as many as those who rule by this will walk, peace be upon them, and mercy;
48.6.16.2^and upon the israel - of god.
48.6.17.1^the henceforth, troubles to me no one let give;
48.6.17.2^i for the marks - of jesus on of the body of me bear.
48.6.18.1^the grace of the lord of us jesus christ be with the spirit of you, brothers.
48.6.18.2^amen.
49.1.1.1^paul, an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god, to the saints - being in ephesus, and faithful in christ jesus.
49.1.2.1^grace to you and peace from god the father of us and the lord jesus christ.
49.1.3.1^blessed be the god and father of the lord of us jesus christ, the one having blessed us with every blessing spiritual in the heavenly realms in christ,
49.1.4.1^just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, to be for us holy and blameless before him, in love
49.1.5.1^having predestined us for divine adoption as sons through jesus christ, to himself, according to the good pleasure of the will of him,
49.1.6.1^to the praise of the glory of the of grace of him, which he has freely given us in the beloved one,
49.1.7.1^in whom we have - redemption through the blood of him, the forgiveness - of trespasses, according to the riches of the grace of him,
49.1.8.1^which he lavished upon us in all wisdom and understanding,
49.1.9.1^having made known to us the mystery of the will of him according to the pleasure of him, which he purposed in him
49.1.10.1^for the administration of the fullness of the times, to bring together the all things in - christ, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth, in him,
49.1.11.1^in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of the one - all things working according to the counsel of the will of him,
49.1.12.1^for - to be us to the praise of the glory of him, the ones having first trusted in - christ,
49.1.13.1^in whom also you, having heard the word - of truth, the gospel of the salvation of you, in whom also having believed, you were sealed with the spirit - of promise - holy,
49.1.14.1^who is the guarantee of the inheritance of us, to the redemption of the acquired possession, to the praise of the glory of him.
49.1.15.1^because of this i also, having heard of the among you faith in the lord jesus and the love - toward all the saints,
49.1.16.1^not do cease giving thanks for you, mention making in the prayers of me,
49.1.17.1^that the god of the lord of us jesus christ, the father - of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him,
49.1.18.1^being enlightened the eyes of the heart of you, in order for - to know you what is the hope of the calling of him, what are the riches of the glory of the inheritance of him in the saints,
49.1.19.1^and what is the surpassing greatness of the power of him toward us, those believing according to the working of the might of the strength of him,
49.1.20.1^which he worked in - christ, having raised him out from the dead and having set him at the right hand of him in the heavenly realms,
49.1.21.1^above every principality and authority and power and dominion, and every name being named, not only in the age this, but also in the one coming.
49.1.22.1^and all things he put under the feet of him, and him gave to be head over all things to the church,
49.1.23.1^which is the body of him, the fullness of the one - all in all filling.
49.2.1.1^and you, being dead in the trespasses and the sins of you,
49.2.2.1^in which once you walked, according to the age, the world of this, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit - now working in the sons - of disobedience,
49.2.3.1^among whom also we all lived once in the desires of the flesh of us, doing the things willed of the flesh, and of its thoughts;
49.2.3.2^and we were children, by nature, of wrath, as even the rest.
49.2.4.1^- but god, rich being in mercy, because of the great love of him with which he loved us,
49.2.5.1^even being we dead - in trespasses, made us alive with - christ   by grace you are saved
49.2.6.1^and he raised us up together and seated us together in the heavenly realms in christ jesus,
49.2.7.1^in order that he might show in the ages that are coming the surpassing riches of the grace of him in kindness toward us in christ jesus.
49.2.8.1^- for by grace you are saved through faith, and this not of yourselves;
49.2.8.2^it is of god the gift,
49.2.9.1^not as a result of works, so that not anyone may boast.
49.2.10.1^of him for we are workmanship, having been created in christ jesus for works good, which prepared beforehand - god, that in them we should walk.
49.2.11.1^therefore remember that formerly you the gentiles in the flesh, the ones being called the uncircumcision by that being called the circumcision, in the flesh made by hands
49.2.12.1^that you were at the time that separate from christ, alienated from the commonwealth - of israel, and strangers to the covenants of the promise, hope not having and without god in the world.
49.2.13.1^now however in christ jesus, you the ones once being far off have become near by the blood - of christ.
49.2.14.1^he himself for is the peace of us, - having made - both one, and the barrier of the fence having broken down, the hostility, in the flesh of him,
49.2.15.1^the law - of commandments in ordinances having annulled, so that the two he might create in himself into one new man, making peace;
49.2.16.1^and he might reconcile - both in one body - to god through the cross, having slain the hostility by it.
49.2.17.1^and having come, he proclaimed the gospel:
49.2.17.2^peace to you, the ones far off, and peace to those near.
49.2.18.1^for through him we have the access - both by one spirit to the father.
49.2.19.1^so then no longer are you strangers and aliens, but are fellow citizens of the saints and of the household - of god,
49.2.20.1^having been built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, being the cornerstone himself christ jesus,
49.2.21.1^in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is increasing into a temple, holy in the lord,
49.2.22.1^in whom also you are being built together for a habitation - of god in the spirit.
49.3.1.1^of this for reason, i paul, the prisoner - of christ jesus, for you - gentiles.
49.3.1.2^.
49.3.1.3^.
49.3.2.1^if indeed you have heard of the administration of the grace - of god, - having been given to me toward you,
49.3.3.1^that by revelation he made known to me the mystery, just as i have written before in brief,
49.3.4.1^by which you are able, reading it, to understand the insight of me into the mystery - of christ,
49.3.5.1^which in other generations not was made known to the sons - of men, as now it has been revealed to holy apostles his and prophets in the spirit,
49.3.6.1^are the gentiles joint-heirs, and a joint-body, and joint-partakers of the promise in christ jesus, through the gospel,
49.3.7.1^of which i became servant according to the gift of the grace - of god -, having been given to me according to the working of the power of him.
49.3.8.1^to me, the very least of all saints, was given the grace this:
49.3.8.2^to the gentiles to preach the unsearchable riches - of christ,
49.3.9.1^and to enlighten all what is the administration of the mystery - having been hidden from the ages in - god, the one - all things having created,
49.3.10.1^so that should be made known now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly realms, through the church, the manifold wisdom - of god,
49.3.11.1^according to the purpose of the ages, which he accomplished in - christ jesus the lord of us,
49.3.12.1^in whom we have - boldness and access in confidence, by the faith from him.
49.3.13.1^therefore i implore you not to lose heart at the tribulations of me for you, which is glory of you.
49.3.14.1^.
49.3.14.2^.
49.3.14.3^.
49.3.14.4^of this for reason i bow the knees of me to the father,
49.3.15.1^from whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named,
49.3.16.1^that he might give you according to the riches of the glory of him, with power, to be strengthened by the spirit of him in the inner man,
49.3.17.1^for to dwell - christ through - faith in the hearts of you, in love being rooted and being founded,
49.3.18.1^so that you may be fully able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
49.3.19.1^to know then the surpassing - knowledge love - of christ, so that you may be filled unto all the fullness - of god.
49.3.20.1^to the one now being able above all things to do exceedingly that we ask or think, according to the power - working in us,
49.3.21.1^to him be the glory in the church and in christ jesus to all the generations of the age of the ages.
49.3.21.2^amen.
49.4.1.1^exhort therefore you i, the prisoner in the lord, worthily to walk of the calling to which you were called,
49.4.2.1^with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love,
49.4.3.1^being diligent to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond - of peace;
49.4.4.1^one body and one spirit, just as also you were called into one hope of the calling of you;
49.4.5.1^one lord, one faith, one baptism;
49.4.6.1^one god and father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.
49.4.7.1^one now to each of us has been given - grace according to the measure of the gift - of christ.
49.4.8.1^therefore it says:
49.4.8.2^having ascended on high, he led captive captivity, and gave gifts - to men.
49.4.9.1^- and, he ascended,  what is if not that also he descended into the lower regions of the earth?
49.4.10.1^the one having descended, the same is also one having ascended above all the heavens, so that he might fill - all things.
49.4.11.1^and he gave some indeed to be apostles, some now prophets, some now evangelists, some now shepherds and teachers,
49.4.12.1^toward the perfecting of the saints, for the work of ministry, for the building up of the body - of christ,
49.4.13.1^until we may attain - all to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son - of god, unto a man a complete, to the measure of the stature of the fullness - of christ,
49.4.14.1^so that no longer we might be infants, being tossed by waves and being carried about by every wind - of teaching, in the cunning - of men in craftiness, with a view to the scheming - of deceit.
49.4.15.1^speaking the truth however in love, we should grow up into him in all things who is the head, christ,
49.4.16.1^from whom all the body, being joined together and being held together by every ligament of its supply, according to the working in the measure individual of each part, the increase of the body makes for itself to the building up of itself in love.
49.4.17.1^this therefore i say and testify in the lord:
49.4.17.2^no longer are you to walk as also the gentiles are walking, in the futility of the mind of them,
49.4.18.1^being darkened in the understanding, being alienated from the life - of god, because of the ignorance - being in them, on account of the hardness of the heart of them,
49.4.19.1^who having cast off all feeling, themselves have given up to sensuality, for the working of impurity, all with greediness.
49.4.20.1^you however not this way learned - christ,
49.4.21.1^if indeed him you have heard and in him have been taught, just as is the truth in - jesus.
49.4.22.1^are to have put off you, concerning the former way of life, the old man, which is being corrupted, according to its desires - of deceit,
49.4.23.1^to be renewed then in the spirit of the mind of you,
49.4.24.1^and to have put on the new man, - according to god having been created in righteousness and holiness - of truth.
49.4.25.1^therefore having put off - falsehood, let speak truth each one with the neighbor of him, because we are of one another members.
49.4.26.1^be angry, and yet not sin.
49.4.26.2^the sun not let set upon - anger of you;
49.4.27.1^neither give opportunity to the devil.
49.4.28.1^the one stealing, no longer let him steal;
49.4.28.2^rather however let him toil, working with the own hands what is good, so that he may have something to impart to the one need having.
49.4.29.1^any word unwholesome out of the mouth of you not let go forth, but if any good for edification of the need, so that it may give grace to those hearing.
49.4.30.1^and not grieve the spirit - holy - of god, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
49.4.31.1^all bitterness, and rage, and anger, and clamor, and slander, let be removed from you, along with all malice.
49.4.32.1^be now to one another kind, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, as also - god in christ forgave you.
49.5.1.1^be therefore imitators - of god, as children beloved,
49.5.2.1^and walk in love, just as also - christ loved us and gave up himself for us as an offering and a sacrifice - to god, into an aroma of a sweet smell.
49.5.3.1^sexual immorality however, and impurity all, or covetousness, not even let be named among you, as also is proper to saints,
49.5.4.1^and filthiness, and foolish talking, or crude joking, which not are fitting;
49.5.4.2^but rather thanksgiving.
49.5.5.1^this for you know, realizing that any fornicator, or unclean person, or covetous man, who is an idolater, not has inheritance in the kingdom - of christ, and of god.
49.5.6.1^no one you let deceive with empty words, because of these things for comes the wrath - of god upon the sons - of disobedience.
49.5.7.1^not therefore be partakers with them.
49.5.8.1^you were for once darkness;
49.5.8.2^now however, light in the lord;
49.5.8.3^as children of light walk
49.5.9.1^- for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth
49.5.10.1^discerning what is well-pleasing to the lord.
49.5.11.1^and not have fellowship with the works - unfruitful - of darkness;
49.5.11.2^rather however even expose them;
49.5.12.1^the things for in secret being done by them, shameful it is even to mention.
49.5.13.1^- but everything being exposed by the light is made visible,
49.5.14.1^everything for - becoming visible light is.
49.5.14.2^therefore it says:
49.5.14.3^awake you, the one sleeping, and rise up out from the dead, and will shine upon you - christ.
49.5.15.1^take heed therefore carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise,
49.5.16.1^redeeming the time, because the days evil are.
49.5.17.1^because of this, not be foolish, but understand what the will of the lord is.
49.5.18.1^and not to be drunk with wine, in which is debauchery.
49.5.18.2^instead be filled with the spirit,
49.5.19.1^speaking to each other in psalms and hymns and songs spiritual, singing and making melody in the heart of you to the lord,
49.5.20.1^giving thanks at all times for all things in the name the lord of us jesus christ to the god and father.
49.5.21.1^be submitting yourselves to one another in reverence of christ:
49.5.22.1^- wives, to the own husbands, as to the lord;
49.5.23.1^for the husband is head of the wife, as also - christ is the head of the church, he himself savior of the body.
49.5.24.1^but even as the church is subjected - to christ, so also - wives to the own husbands in everything.
49.5.25.1^- husbands, love the wives, just as also - christ loved the church and himself gave up for her,
49.5.26.1^so that her he might sanctify, having cleansed her by the washing - of water by the word,
49.5.27.1^so that might present he to himself in glory the church, not having spot or wrinkle or any of the such things, but that it would be holy and blameless.
49.5.28.1^so ought also - husbands to love the of themselves wives, as the of themselves bodies.
49.5.28.2^the one loving the of himself wife, himself loves.
49.5.29.1^no one for at any time the of himself flesh hated, but he nourishes and cherishes it, just as also does - christ the church;
49.5.30.1^for members we are of the body of him.
49.5.31.1^because of this, will leave a man his father and - mother and be joined to the wife of him, and will be the two into flesh one.
49.5.32.1^the mystery this great is;
49.5.32.2^i however speak as to christ, and as to the church.
49.5.33.1^however also you - according to individual, each the of himself wife, so let love as himself;
49.5.33.2^- and the wife that she may respect the husband.
49.6.1.1^- children, obey the parents of you in the lord;
49.6.1.2^this for is right.
49.6.2.1^honor the father of you and - mother, which is the commandment first with a promise,
49.6.3.1^that well with you it may be, and you will be long-lived upon the earth.
49.6.4.1^and - fathers, not provoke the children of you, but bring up them in the discipline and admonition of the lord.
49.6.5.1^- slaves, obey the according to flesh masters with fear and trembling, in sincerity of the heart of you, as to christ,
49.6.6.1^not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but as servants of christ, doing the will - of god from the heart,
49.6.7.1^with good will rendering service, as to the lord and not to men,
49.6.8.1^knowing that each one, if whatever he might have done good, this he will receive back from the lord, whether slave or free.
49.6.9.1^and - masters, the same things them do toward them, giving up the threatening, knowing that also of them and of you the master is in the heavens, and partiality not there is with him.
49.6.10.1^- henceforth be empowered in the lord, and in the strength of the might of him.
49.6.11.1^put on the complete armor - of god, for - to be able you to stand against the schemes of the devil,
49.6.12.1^because not is to us the wrestling against blood and flesh, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of the darkness this, against the spiritual forces - of evil in the heavenly realms.
49.6.13.1^because of this, take up the complete armor - of god, so that you may be able to withstand in the day - evil, and all things having done, to stand.
49.6.14.1^stand therefore, having girded the loins of you with truth, and having put on the breastplate - of righteousness,
49.6.15.1^and having shod the feet with the readiness of the gospel - of peace;
49.6.16.1^besides all, having taken up the shield - of faith, with which you will be able all the arrows of the evil one - flaming to quench.
49.6.17.1^and the helmet - of salvation take, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of god,
49.6.18.1^through all prayer and supplication, praying in every season in the spirit, and unto this very thing, watching with all perseverance and supplication for all - saints,
49.6.19.1^and also for me, that to me may be given divine utterance in the opening of the mouth of me, with boldness to make known the mystery of the gospel,
49.6.20.1^for which i am an ambassador in a chain, that in it i may be bold, as it behooves me to speak.
49.6.21.1^that now may know also you the things concerning me, what i am doing, all things will make known to you tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant in the lord,
49.6.22.1^whom i have sent to you for this very purpose, that you may know the things concerning us, and he may encourage the hearts of you.
49.6.23.1^peace to the brothers and love with faith from god the father and the lord jesus christ.
49.6.24.1^- grace be with all those loving the lord of us jesus christ in incorruptibility.
50.1.1.1^paul and timothy, servants of christ jesus, to all the saints in christ jesus - being in philippi, with the overseers and deacons:
50.1.2.1^grace to you and peace from god father of us and the lord jesus christ.
50.1.3.1^i thank the god of me upon every - remembrance of you,
50.1.4.1^always in every supplication of me for all of you, with joy the supplication making
50.1.5.1^for the partnership of you in the gospel from the first day until - now,
50.1.6.1^being persuaded of the very thing this, that the one having begun in you a work good will complete it until the day of christ jesus.
50.1.7.1^accordingly, it is right for me this to feel about all of you, since - have i in the heart you;
50.1.7.2^in both the chains of me, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, fellow partakers with me of grace all you are.
50.1.8.1^witness for my - god is, how i long after all you in the affection of christ jesus.
50.1.9.1^and this i pray, that the love of you, yet more and more may abound in knowledge and all discernment,
50.1.10.1^for - to approve you the things being excellent, so that you may be pure and blameless unto the day of christ,
50.1.11.1^being filled with the fruit of righteousness that is through jesus christ, to the glory and praise of god.
50.1.12.1^to know now you, i want, brothers, that the things concerning me, really to the advancement of the gospel have turned out,
50.1.13.1^so as for the chains of me clearly known in christ to have become in all the palace guard, and to the rest all;
50.1.14.1^and - most of the brothers, in the lord trusting by the chains of me, more abundantly to dare fearlessly the word to speak.
50.1.15.1^some indeed even from envy and strife, some however also from goodwill - christ are proclaiming
50.1.16.1^the ones indeed out of love, knowing that for defense of the gospel i am appointed;
50.1.17.1^the ones however out of selfish ambition - christ are proclaiming, not purely, supposing tribulation to add to the chains of me.
50.1.18.1^what then?
50.1.18.2^only that in every way, whether in pretext or in truth, christ is proclaimed.
50.1.18.3^and in this i rejoice.
50.1.18.4^yes, and i will rejoice.
50.1.19.1^i know for that this for me will turn out to deliverance through - your prayer and the provision of the spirit of jesus christ,
50.1.20.1^according to the earnest expectation and hope of me that in nothing i will be ashamed, but in all boldness, as always also now, will be magnified christ in the body of me, whether by life or by death.
50.1.21.1^to me for - to live is christ, and - to die is gain.
50.1.22.1^if i am however - to live in flesh, this for me is the fruit of labor.
50.1.22.2^and what shall i choose?
50.1.22.3^not i know!
50.1.23.1^i am pressed however between the two, the desire having for myself - to depart and with christ to be, very much for more better;
50.1.24.1^- but to remain in the flesh is more necessary for the sake of you.
50.1.25.1^and this having been persuaded of, i know that i will remain and will continue with all of you for - your progress and joy of the faith,
50.1.26.1^so that the boasting of you may abound to christ jesus in me through - my coming again to you.
50.1.27.1^only worthily of the gospel - of christ conduct yourselves, so that whether having come and having seen you, or being absent, i might hear the things concerning you, that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel,
50.1.28.1^and not being frightened in nothing by those opposing you, which is to them a demonstration of destruction;
50.1.28.2^to you however of salvation, and this from god.
50.1.29.1^for to you it has been granted - concerning christ, not only - in him to believe, but also - concerning him to suffer,
50.1.30.1^the same conflict having, such as you saw in me and now hear of in me.
50.2.1.1^if there is any therefore encouragement in christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the spirit, if any affections and compassions,
50.2.2.1^fulfill my - joy so that the same you may be minded, the same love having, united in soul, the same thing minding,
50.2.3.1^nothing according to self-interest or according to vain conceit, but - in humility one another be esteeming surpassing themselves,
50.2.4.1^not the things of themselves each considering, but also the things of others each.
50.2.5.1^this let mind be in you which also in christ jesus was:
50.2.6.1^who in the form of god existing, not something to be grasped considered - to be equal with god,
50.2.7.1^but himself emptied, the form of a servant having taken, in the likeness of men having been made.
50.2.7.2^and in appearance having been found as a man,
50.2.8.1^he humbled himself, having become obedient unto death, the death even of the cross.
50.2.9.1^therefore also - god him highly exalted, and granted to him the name - above every name,
50.2.10.1^that at the name of jesus every knee should bow, in the heavens and on earth and under the earth,
50.2.11.1^and every tongue should confess that is lord jesus christ, to the glory of god the father.
50.2.12.1^therefore, beloved of me, just as always you have obeyed, not as in the presence of me only, but now much more in the absence of me, with fear and trembling - your own salvation work out.
50.2.13.1^god for is the one working in you both - to will and - to work according to his good pleasure.
50.2.14.1^all things do without murmurings and disputings,
50.2.15.1^so that you may be blameless and innocent, children of god, unblemished in the midst of a generation crooked and perverted, among whom you shine as lights in the world,
50.2.16.1^the word of life holding forth, unto a boast to me in the day of christ that not in vain i did run nor in vain toil.
50.2.17.1^but if even i am being poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of the faith of you, i am glad and rejoice with all you.
50.2.18.1^- and likewise also you be glad and rejoice with me.
50.2.19.1^i hope however in the lord jesus, timothy soon to send to you, that i also may be encouraged, having known the things concerning you.
50.2.20.1^no one for i have like-minded, who genuinely the things relative to you will care for.
50.2.21.1^those all for the things of themselves are seeking, not the things jesus.
50.2.21.2^of christ
50.2.22.1^- but the proven worth of him you know, that as a father with a child, with me he has served in the gospel.
50.2.23.1^him indeed therefore i hope to send, when - i shall have seen the things concerning me, immediately.
50.2.24.1^i am persuaded now in the lord that also i myself soon i will come.
50.2.25.1^necessary now i esteemed it, epaphroditus, the brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier of me, of you now messenger and minister of the need of me, to send to you,
50.2.26.1^since longing after he was all you and being deeply distressed because you heard that he was ill.
50.2.27.1^and indeed he was sick nearly unto death, but - god had mercy on him;
50.2.27.2^not on him now alone, but also on me, that not sorrow upon sorrow i should have.
50.2.28.1^all the more speedily therefore i have sent him, that having seen him again, you may rejoice, and i less anxious might be.
50.2.29.1^receive therefore him in the lord with all joy, and - such in honor hold,
50.2.30.1^because for the sake of the work of christ, unto death he came near, having disregarded his life so that he might fill up the of you deficit of toward me service.
50.3.1.1^- finally, brothers of me, rejoice in the lord.
50.3.1.2^the same things to write to you, to me indeed is not troublesome;
50.3.1.3^for you now is safe.
50.3.2.1^beware of the dogs;
50.3.2.2^beware of the evil workers;
50.3.2.3^beware of the false circumcision.
50.3.3.1^we for are the circumcision, those in the spirit of god worshiping and glorying in christ jesus, and not in the flesh having put confidence,
50.3.4.1^though i have confidence even in the flesh.
50.3.4.2^if any thinks other to have confidence in the flesh, i more:
50.3.5.1^circumcision on the eighth day;
50.3.5.2^of the nation of israel, of the tribe of benjamin;
50.3.5.3^a hebrew of hebrews;
50.3.5.4^according to the law, a pharisee;
50.3.6.1^according to zeal, persecuting the church;
50.3.6.2^according to righteousness which is in the law, having become faultless.
50.3.7.1^but whatever things were to me gain, these i have esteemed, because of - christ, loss.
50.3.8.1^but -, therefore indeed, also i count all things loss to be because of the excelling - knowledge of christ jesus the lord of me, because of whom - all things i have lost, and esteem them rubbish, that christ i may gain
50.3.9.1^and be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that through faith from christ, the of god righteousness on the basis of - faith,
50.3.10.1^- to know him and the power of the resurrection of him, and the fellowship of sufferings of him, being conformed to the death of him,
50.3.11.1^if, by any means, i may attain to the resurrection - out from dead.
50.3.12.1^not that already i have obtained it, or already have been perfected;
50.3.12.2^i am pursuing however, if also i may lay hold of that for which also i was laid hold of by christ jesus.
50.3.13.1^brothers, i myself not do consider to have taken hold of it.
50.3.13.2^one thing however:
50.3.13.3^the things indeed behind forgetting, to the things now ahead reaching forward,
50.3.14.1^toward the goal i press on for the prize of the upward calling - of god in christ jesus.
50.3.15.1^as many as therefore are mature, this should be of mind;
50.3.15.2^and if in anything differently you are minded, even this - god to you will reveal.
50.3.16.1^nevertheless to that which we have attained, by the same to walk.
50.3.17.1^imitators together of me be, brothers, and observe those thus walking, as you have for a pattern us.
50.3.18.1^many for are walking   of whom often i told you, now indeed even weeping i say   - as enemies of the cross - of christ,
50.3.19.1^whose - end is destruction, whose - god is the belly, and - glory is in the shame of them, those things earthly minding.
50.3.20.1^of us for the citizenship in the heavens exists, from whence also a savior we are awaiting, the lord jesus christ,
50.3.21.1^who will transform the body - of humiliation of us, conformed to the body of the glory of himself, according to the working - enabling him even to subdue to himself - all things.
50.4.1.1^therefore, brothers of me, beloved and longed for, the joy and crown of me, in this way stand firm in the lord, beloved.
50.4.2.1^euodia i exhort and syntyche i exhort, the same to be of mind in the lord.
50.4.3.1^yes, i ask also you, true yokefellow, help these women, who in the gospel labored together with me, with also clement and the rest of the fellow workers of me, whose - names are in the book of life.
50.4.4.1^rejoice in the lord always;
50.4.4.2^again i will say, rejoice!
50.4.5.1^the gentleness of you let be known to all men.

51.1.13.1^who has delivered us from the dominion - of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the son - beloved of him,
51.1.14.1^in whom we have - redemption, the forgiveness - of sins.
51.1.15.1^he is the image of the god - invisible, the firstborn over all creation,
51.1.16.1^because in him were created - all things in the heavens and upon the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities;
51.1.16.2^- all things through him and unto him have been created.
51.1.17.1^and he is before all things, and - all things in him hold together.
51.1.18.1^and he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, firstborn out from the dead, so that might be in all things he holding preeminence,

51.1.20.1^and by him to reconcile - all things to himself, having made peace by the blood of the cross of him, through him, whether the things on the earth, or the things in the heavens.

51.1.24.1^now i rejoice in the sufferings for you, and i am filling up that which is lacking of the tribulations - of christ in the flesh of me for the body of him which is the church,
51.1.25.1^of which became i a minister, according to the administration - of god - having been given me toward you, to complete the word - of god,
51.1.26.1^the mystery - having been hidden from the ages and from the generations, now however having been manifested to the saints of him,
51.1.27.1^to whom has willed - god to make known what is the riches of the glory of the mystery this among the gentiles, which is christ in you, the hope - of glory,
51.1.28.1^whom we preach, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, so that we may present every man perfect in christ.
51.1.29.1^unto this also i toil, striving according to the energy of him - working in me in power.
51.2.1.1^i want for you to know how great a struggle i am having for you, and those in laodicea, and as many as not have seen the face of me in the flesh,
51.2.2.1^that may be encouraged the hearts of them, having been knit together in love, and to all the riches of the full assurance - of understanding, to the knowledge of the mystery - of god, which is christ,
51.2.3.1^in whom are all the treasures - of wisdom and of knowledge hidden.
51.2.4.1^this i say so that no one you might delude by persuasive speech.
51.2.5.1^if truly indeed in the flesh i am absent, yet - in spirit with you i am, rejoicing and seeing your - good order and the firmness of the in christ faith of you.
51.2.6.1^just as therefore you have received - christ jesus the lord, in him walk,
51.2.7.1^having been rooted and being built up in him, and being strengthened in the faith just as you were taught, abounding with thanksgiving.
51.2.8.1^take heed lest anyone you there will be - taking captive through - philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition - of men, according to the principles of the world and not according to christ.
51.2.9.1^for in him dwells all the fullness of the deity bodily;
51.2.10.1^and you are in him complete, who is the head of all rule and authority,
51.2.11.1^in whom also you were circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in the removal of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision - of christ,
51.2.12.1^having been buried with him in - baptism, in which also you were raised with him through the faith of the working - of god, the one having raised him out from the dead.
51.2.13.1^and you dead being in the trespasses and in the uncircumcision of the flesh of you, he made alive together you with him, having forgiven us all the transgressions,
51.2.14.1^having blotted out the against us handwriting in the decrees, which was adverse to us;
51.2.14.2^and it he has taken out of the way, having nailed it to the cross.
51.2.15.1^having disarmed the rulers and the authorities, he made a show of them in public, having triumphed over them in it.
51.2.16.1^not therefore anyone you let judge in regard to food, or in regard to drink, or in regard to a feast, or a new moon, or sabbaths,
51.2.17.1^which are a shadow the things coming;
51.2.17.2^the however body is - of christ.
51.2.18.1^no one you let disqualify, delighting in humility and the worship of the angels, which he has seen detailing, vainly being puffed up by the mind of the flesh of him,
51.2.19.1^and not holding fast to the head, from whom all the body, by the joints and ligaments being supplied and being knit together, increases with the increase - of god.
51.2.20.1^if you have died with christ away from the principles of the world, why as if living in the world, do you submit to decrees:
51.2.21.1^not you should handle!
51.2.21.2^not you should taste!
51.2.21.3^not you should touch!
51.2.22.1^which are all unto decay with the use, according to the commandments and teachings - of men,
51.2.23.1^which are an appearance indeed having of wisdom, in self-imposed worship and humility and harsh treatment of the body, not of honor a certain, against the indulgence of the flesh.
51.3.1.1^if then you have been raised with - christ, the things above seek, where - christ is at the right hand - of god sitting.
51.3.2.1^the things above set your minds on, not the things on the earth.
51.3.3.1^you have died for, and the life of you has been hidden with - christ in - god.
51.3.4.1^when - christ may be revealed, the life of you, then also you with him will appear in glory.
51.3.5.1^put to death therefore the members which are upon the earth:
51.3.5.2^sexual immorality, impurity, passion, desire evil, and - covetousness, which is idolatry,
51.3.6.1^because of which things is coming the wrath - of god on the sons of disobedience,
51.3.7.1^in which also you walked once when you were living in them.
51.3.8.1^now however, put off also you - all these things:
51.3.8.2^anger, rage, malice, slander, foul language out of the mouth of you.
51.3.9.1^not do lie to one another, having put off the old man with the practices of him,
51.3.10.1^and having put on the new, the one being renewed in knowledge according to the image of the one having created him,
51.3.11.1^where not there is greek and jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, scythian, slave, free;
51.3.11.2^but - all and in all christ is.
51.3.12.1^put on therefore, as the elect - of god, holy and beloved, hearts of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience;
51.3.13.1^bearing with each other and forgiving each other.
51.3.13.2^if anyone against another should have a complaint, even as also the lord has forgiven you, so also you.
51.3.14.1^beyond all now these, put on the love, which is the bond - of perfect unity.
51.3.15.1^and the peace - from christ let rule in the hearts of you, to which also you were called in one body.
51.3.15.2^and thankful be.
51.3.16.1^the word - of christ let dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing each other in psalms, hymns, and songs spiritual, with - grace singing, in the hearts of you, to god.
51.3.17.1^and everything, which what if you might do in word or in deed, all in the name of the lord jesus, giving thanks - to god the father through him.
51.3.18.1^- wives, submit yourselves to the husbands, as is fitting in the lord.
51.3.19.1^- husbands, love the wives, and not be harsh toward them.
51.3.20.1^- children, obey the parents in all things;
51.3.20.2^this for pleasing is in the lord.
51.3.21.1^- fathers, not do provoke the children of you, that not they might become discouraged.
51.3.22.1^- slaves, obey in all things the according to flesh masters, not with eye-services as men-pleasers, but in sincerity of heart, fearing the lord.
51.3.23.1^whatever if you might do, from the soul work, as to the lord and not to men,
51.3.24.1^knowing that from the lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance.
51.3.24.2^the lord christ you serve.
51.3.25.1^the one for doing wrong will be repaid for what he has done wrong, and not there is partiality.
51.4.1.1^- masters, that which is righteous and that which is equal, to the slaves give, knowing that also you have a master in heaven.
51.4.2.1^- in prayer continue steadfastly, watching in it with thanksgiving,
51.4.3.1^praying at the same time also for us, that - god may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery - of christ, on account of which also i have been bound,
51.4.4.1^so that i should make clear it, as it behooves me to speak.
51.4.5.1^in wisdom walk toward those outside, the time redeeming.
51.4.6.1^- let the speech of you be always in grace, with salt having been seasoned, to know how it behooves you one each to answer.
51.4.7.1^the things concerning me all will make known to you tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant and fellow bond-servant in the lord,
51.4.8.1^whom i sent to you for this very purpose, that you might know the things concerning us, and he may encourage the hearts of you,
51.4.9.1^with onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you.
51.4.9.2^all things to you they will make known - here.
51.4.10.1^greets you, aristarchus the fellow prisoner of me, and mark, the cousin of barnabas, concerning whom you have received instructions   if he comes to you, welcome him
51.4.11.1^and also jesus - called justus, - being among the circumcision these only fellow workers for the kingdom - of god, who have been to me a comfort.
51.4.12.1^greets you, epaphras who is one of you, a servant of christ jesus, always struggling for you in the prayers, so that you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will - of god.
51.4.13.1^i bear witness for to him that he has great concern for you and those in laodicea and them in hiera polis.

51.4.16.1^and when shall be read among you the letter, cause that also in the of the laodiceans church it may be read, and the one from laodicea that also you may read.
51.4.17.1^and say to archippus, take heed to the ministry that you have received in the lord, that it you may fulfill.
51.4.18.1^the greeting is in the own hand   paul.
51.4.18.2^remember my - chains.
51.4.18.3^- grace be with you.
52.1.1.1^paul and silvanus and timothy, to the church of the thessalonians in god the father and the lord jesus christ:
52.1.1.2^grace to you and peace.
52.1.2.1^we give thanks to god always concerning all of you, mention making in the prayers of us, unceasingly
52.1.3.1^remembering your - work - of faith and - labor - of love, and the endurance of the hope of the lord of us jesus christ, before the god and father of us,
52.1.4.1^knowing, brothers beloved by - god, the election of you,
52.1.5.1^because the gospel of us not came to you in word only, but also in power and in the spirit holy, and with full assurance much, just as you know what we were among you on account of you.
52.1.6.1^and you imitators of us became, and of the lord, having received the word in tribulation much, with the joy of the spirit holy,
52.1.7.1^so as for to became you an example to all the believing ones in - macedonia and in - achaia.
52.1.8.1^from you for has sounded forth the word of the lord, not only in - macedonia and in - achaia, but in every place the faith of you - toward - god has gone abroad, so as for no need to have us to say anything.
52.1.9.1^they themselves for concerning us report what reception we had from you, and how you turned to - god from - idols, to serve the god living and true,
52.1.10.1^and to await the son of him from the heavens, whom he raised out from the dead, jesus, the one delivering us from the wrath - coming.
52.2.1.1^you yourselves for know, brothers, the coming of us - to you that not in vain has been;
52.2.2.1^but having previously suffered and having been mistreated just as you know, in philippi, we had boldness in the god of us, to speak to you the gospel - of god amid much conflict.
52.2.3.1^- for the exhortation of us is not of error, nor of impurity, nor in trickery;
52.2.4.1^but just as we have been approved by - god to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as men pleasing, but god, the one examining the hearts of us.
52.2.5.1^never for at any time with word of flattery were we, just as you know, nor with a pretext for greed   god is witness
52.2.6.1^nor seeking from men glory, nor from you, nor from others,
52.2.7.1^though having authority with weight to be, as christ s apostles.
52.2.7.2^but we were infants in the midst of you, as if a nursing mother would cherish - her own children.
52.2.8.1^so yearning over you, we were pleased to have imparted to you not only the gospel - of god, but also our own lives, because beloved to us you have become.
52.2.9.1^you remember for, brothers, the labor of us and - hardship:
52.2.9.2^night and day working, in order - not to burden anyone of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel - of god.
52.2.10.1^you are witnesses, and - god, how holily, and righteously, and blamelessly, toward you, those believing, we were;
52.2.11.1^just as you know how one each of you, as a father children his own,
52.2.12.1^exhorting you and comforting and charging unto - to walk you worthily - of god, who calls you into the of himself kingdom and glory.
52.2.13.1^and because of this also, we give thanks - to god unceasingly that, having received the word by your hearing from us - of god, you accepted not the word of men, but even as it is, truly the word of god, which also works in you who believe.
52.2.14.1^you for imitators became, brothers, of the churches - of god - being in - judea in christ jesus.
52.2.14.2^for the same as them, suffered also you from the own countrymen, as also did they from the jews,
52.2.15.1^who both the lord having killed, jesus, and their own prophets, and us having driven out, and god not pleasing, and all men who are set against,
52.2.16.1^hindering us to the gentiles to speak, that they might be saved, so as - to fill up their - sins always.
52.2.16.2^has come now upon them the wrath to the utmost.
52.2.17.1^we however, brothers, having been bereaved of you for the time of an hour, in face, not in heart, more abundantly were eager the face of you to see with great desire.
52.2.18.1^therefore we wanted to come to you   i indeed paul, both once and twice   and hindered us - satan.
52.2.19.1^who is for our hope, or joy, or crown of boasting?
52.2.19.2^or are not even you, before the lord of us jesus, at - his coming?
52.2.20.1^you for are the glory of us, and - joy.
52.3.1.1^therefore no longer enduring, we thought it best to be left behind in athens alone,
52.3.2.1^and we sent timothy, the brother of us and fellow worker - of god in the gospel - of christ, in order - to strengthen you and to encourage concerning the faith of you,
52.3.3.1^that no one be moved in the tribulations these.
52.3.3.2^yourselves for you know that for this we are destined.
52.3.4.1^and indeed, when with you we were, we were telling beforehand you that we are about to suffer affliction, just as also it came to pass, and you know.
52.3.5.1^because of this i also, no longer enduring, sent in order - to know the faith of you, lest somehow had tempted you the one tempting, and in vain would be the labor of us.
52.3.6.1^presently however, having come timothy to us from you, and having brought good news to us of the faith and the love of you, and that you have a remembrance of us good always, longing us to see, just as also we you,
52.3.7.1^because of this we were encouraged, brothers, as to you, in all the distress and tribulation of us, through - your faith.
52.3.8.1^for now we live, if you are standing firm in the lord.
52.3.9.1^what for thanksgiving are we able - to god to give concerning you in return for all the joy that we rejoice because of you, before the god of us,
52.3.10.1^night and day, exceedingly imploring for us - to see your - face and to supply the things lacking in the faith of you?
52.3.11.1^himself now the god and father of us, and the lord of us jesus, may direct the way of us to you.
52.3.12.1^you now, the lord may make to increase, and to abound - in love toward one another, and toward all, just as also we toward you,
52.3.13.1^in order - to strengthen your - hearts, blameless in holiness before the god and father of us at the coming of the lord of us jesus, with all the saints of him.
52.3.13.2^amen.
52.4.1.1^finally then, brothers, we implore you and exhort in the lord jesus that, just as you have received from us - in what manner it behooves you to walk and to please god, just as even you walk now, so you should abound more.
52.4.2.1^you know for what instructions we gave you, through the lord jesus.
52.4.3.1^this for is the will - of god, the sanctification of you:
52.4.3.2^to abstain you are from - sexual immorality;
52.4.4.1^to know each of you how the of himself vessel to control in holiness and honor,
52.4.5.1^not in the passion of lust, as also the gentiles, - not knowing - god;
52.4.6.1^- not to go beyond and to overreach in the matter, the brother of him, because avenging is the lord concerning all these things, just as also we told before you, and thoroughly warned.
52.4.7.1^not for has called us - god to impurity, but into holiness.
52.4.8.1^so then, the one rejecting this, not man disregards, but - god, the one also giving the spirit of him - holy to you.
52.4.9.1^concerning now - brotherly love, no need you have for me to write to you, yourselves for you taught by god are, in order - to love one another.
52.4.10.1^and for you are doing this toward all the brothers, the ones in all - macedonia.
52.4.10.2^we exhort however you, brothers, to abound more and more,
52.4.11.1^and to strive earnestly to live quietly and to attend to the own, and to work with the own hands of you, just as you we commanded,
52.4.12.1^so that you may walk properly toward those outside, and of no one need may have.
52.4.13.1^not we do want but you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those having fallen asleep, so that not you should be grieved, just as also the rest, those not having hope.
52.4.14.1^if for we believe that jesus died and rose again, so also - god, those having fallen asleep through - jesus, will bring with him.
52.4.15.1^this for to you we declare in the word of the lord, that we the living - remaining, unto the coming of the lord no not shall precede those having fallen asleep,
52.4.16.1^because himself the lord with a loud command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of god, will descend from heaven, and the dead in christ will rise first.
52.4.17.1^then we the living - remaining, together with them, will be caught away in the clouds for the meeting of the lord in the air;
52.4.17.2^and so always with the lord we will be.
52.4.18.1^therefore encourage one another with the words these.
52.5.1.1^concerning now the times and the seasons, brothers, no need you have to you to be written.
52.5.2.1^yourselves for fully you know that the day of the lord, as a thief by night, in this manner comes.
52.5.3.1^for when they might say, peace and security, then suddenly upon them comes destruction, as the labor pains to her in womb having;
52.5.3.2^and no not shall they escape.
52.5.4.1^you however, brothers, not are in darkness, that the day you like a thief should overtake.
52.5.5.1^all for you, sons of light are, and sons of day.
52.5.5.2^not we are of night nor of darkness.
52.5.6.1^so then not we should sleep as the others, but we should watch and we should be sober.
52.5.7.1^those for sleeping, by night sleep;
52.5.7.2^and those becoming drunk, by night get drunk.
52.5.8.1^we however, of the day being, should be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and the helmet the hope of salvation,
52.5.9.1^because not has destined us - god for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through the lord of us jesus christ,
52.5.10.1^the one having died for us, so that whether we might watch or we might sleep, together with him we may live.
52.5.11.1^therefore encourage one another and build up one - another, just as also you are doing.
52.5.12.1^we implore however you, brothers, to appreciate those toiling among you and taking the lead over you in the lord, and admonishing you,
52.5.13.1^and to esteem them exceedingly in love, because of the work of them.
52.5.13.2^be at peace among yourselves.
52.5.14.1^we exhort now you, brothers, to admonish the unruly, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient toward all.
52.5.15.1^see that no one evil for evil to anyone has repaid, but always the good pursue also toward one another and toward all.
52.5.16.1^always rejoice.
52.5.17.1^unceasingly pray.
52.5.18.1^in everything give thanks;

53.1.4.1^so as for ourselves, us in you to boast, in the churches - of god, about the perseverance of you, and faith in all the persecutions of you, and in the tribulations that you are bearing.
53.1.5.1^this is a plain token of the righteous judgment - of god, unto - to be accounted worthy you of the kingdom - of god, for which also you suffer.
53.1.6.1^for indeed righteous it is with god to repay those oppressing you with affliction,
53.1.7.1^and to you - being oppressed, repose with us at the revelation of the lord jesus from heaven, with the angels mighty of him
53.1.8.1^in a fire of flame, inflicting vengeance on those not knowing god and on those not obeying the gospel of the lord of us jesus,
53.1.9.1^who the penalty will suffer of destruction eternal, away from the presence of the lord and from the glory of the power of him,
53.1.10.1^when he shall come to be glorified in the saints of him, and to be marveled at among all those having believed, because was believed the testimony of us to you in the day that,
53.1.11.1^for which also we pray always for you, that you he may count worthy of the calling of the god of us, and he may fulfill every good pleasure of goodness and work of faith with power,
53.1.12.1^so that may be glorified the name of the lord of us jesus in you, and you in him, according to the grace of the god of us and the lord jesus christ.
53.2.1.1^we implore now you, brothers, by the coming of the lord of us jesus christ and our gathering together unto him,
53.2.2.1^for - not quickly to be shaken you in - mind nor to be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as if by us, as that is present the day of the lord.
53.2.3.1^no one you should deceive in not one way, because it is if not until shall have come the apostasy first, and shall have been revealed the man - of lawlessness, the son - of destruction,
53.2.4.1^the one opposing and exalting himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so as for him in the temple - of god to sit down, setting forth he himself that is god.
53.2.5.1^not do you remember that, yet being with you, these things i was saying to you?
53.2.6.1^and now that which is restraining, you know, for - to be revealed him in - his time.
53.2.7.1^the for mystery already is working - of lawlessness;
53.2.7.2^only there is the one restraining it at present until out of the midst he might be gone.
53.2.8.1^and then will be revealed the lawless one, whom the lord jesus will slay with the breath of the mouth of him and will annul by the appearing of the coming of him,
53.2.9.1^whose is - coming, according to the working - of satan, in every power, and in signs, and in wonders of falsehood,
53.2.10.1^and in every deceit of wickedness unto those perishing, in return for which the love of the truth not they received, in order for - to be saved them.
53.2.11.1^and because of this, will send to them - god a working of delusion, for - to believe them what is false,
53.2.12.1^in order that should be judged all those not having believed the truth, but having delighted - in unrighteousness.
53.2.13.1^we however ought to give thanks - to god always concerning you, brothers beloved by the lord, that has chosen you - god from the beginning, unto salvation in the sanctification of the spirit, and by faith of the truth;

53.2.16.1^himself now the lord of us jesus christ, and - god, the father of us, the one having loved us and having given us comfort eternal and hope good by grace,
53.2.17.1^may he encourage your - hearts and may he strengthen them in every work and word good.
53.3.1.1^- finally, pray, brothers, for us, that the word of the lord may spread quickly and may be glorified, just as also with you,
53.3.2.1^and that we may be delivered from - perverse and evil men;
53.3.2.2^not for all are of the faith.
53.3.3.1^faithful however is the lord, who will strengthen you and will keep you from - evil.
53.3.4.1^we are persuaded now in the lord as to you, that the things that we command, both you are doing and you will do.
53.3.5.1^- and the lord may direct your - hearts into the love - of god and into the steadfastness - of christ.
53.3.6.1^we command now you, brothers, in the name of the lord of us jesus christ, are to withdraw you from every brother idly walking and not according to the tradition that you received from us.
53.3.7.1^yourselves for you know how it behooves you to imitate us, because not we were idle among you,
53.3.8.1^nor without payment bread did we eat from anyone, but in labor and hardship, night and day working, in order - not to be burdensome to any of you,
53.3.9.1^not that not we have the right, but that ourselves as an example we may offer to you, for - you to imitate us.
53.3.10.1^even for when we were with you, this we were commanding you, that if anyone not is willing to work, neither let him eat.
53.3.11.1^we hear for some are walking among you idly, not at all working, but being busybodies.
53.3.12.1^to now such, we warn and exhort by our lord jesus christ, so that, with quietness working, - their own bread they may eat.
53.3.13.1^you now, brothers, not shall grow weary in well-doing.
53.3.14.1^if then anyone not obey this instruction of us through the letter, of this man take note not to mix with him, so that he may be ashamed.
53.3.15.1^and yet not as an enemy esteem him, but admonish him as a brother.
53.3.16.1^himself now the lord - of peace may give you - peace through all, in every way.
53.3.16.2^the lord be with all of you.
53.3.17.1^the greeting - in my own hand   paul, which is my sign in every letter.
53.3.17.2^in this manner i write.
53.3.18.1^the grace of the lord of us jesus christ be with all of you.
54.1.1.1^paul, an apostle of christ jesus according to the command of god the savior of us, and of christ jesus, the hope of us,
54.1.2.1^to timothy, my true child in the faith:
54.1.2.2^grace, mercy, and peace from god the father, and christ jesus, the lord of us.
54.1.3.1^just as i urged you to remain in ephesus, when i was going to macedonia, so that you might warn certain men not to teach other doctrines,
54.1.4.1^nor to give heed to myths and genealogies endless, which speculations bring, rather than stewardship of god, which is in faith.
54.1.5.1^- and the goal of our instruction is love out of a pure heart and a conscience good and a faith sincere,
54.1.6.1^from which some, having missed the mark, have turned aside to meaningless discourse,
54.1.7.1^desiring to be teachers of the law, not understanding neither what they are saying, nor that about which they confidently assert.
54.1.8.1^we know now that good is the law, if one it lawfully uses,
54.1.9.1^knowing this, that for a righteous one law not is enacted, for the lawless however, and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinful, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for slayers of man,
54.1.10.1^for the sexually immoral, homosexuals, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and if anything other, in the being sound teaching, is opposed to,
54.1.11.1^according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed god, with which have been entrusted i.
54.1.12.1^thankfulness i have for the one having strengthened me, christ jesus the lord of us, that faithful me he esteemed, having appointed me to service,
54.1.13.1^- formerly being a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and insolent;
54.1.13.2^but i was shown mercy, because being ignorant, i did it in unbelief.
54.1.14.1^surpassingly increased then the grace of the lord of us, with the faith and love, that are in christ jesus.
54.1.15.1^trustworthy is the saying and of full acceptance worthy, that christ jesus came into the world sinners to save, of whom the foremost am i.
54.1.16.1^but because of this, i was shown mercy, that in me, the foremost, might display christ jesus - perfect patience, as a pattern for those being about to believe on him, to life eternal.
54.1.17.1^to now the king of the ages, the immortal, invisible, only god, be honor and glory, to the ages of the ages.
54.1.17.2^amen.
54.1.18.1^this - charge i commit to you, my child timothy, according to the going before as to you prophecies, that you might war by them the good warfare,
54.1.19.1^holding faith and a good conscience, which some, having cast away, concerning the faith have caused a shipwreck,
54.1.20.1^among whom are hymenaeus and alexander, whom i have handed over - to satan that they may be disciplined not to blaspheme.
54.2.1.1^i exhort therefore, first of all, to be made entreaties, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings, on behalf of all men,
54.2.2.1^for kings and all those in authority being, so that a tranquil and quiet life we may lead, in all godliness and dignity.
54.2.3.1^this is good and acceptable before the savior of us, god,
54.2.4.1^who all men desires to be saved, and to the knowledge of the truth to come.
54.2.5.1^one for god there is, one then mediator between god and men, the man christ jesus,
54.2.6.1^the one having given himself as a ransom for all, the testimony in proper times their own,
54.2.7.1^in regard to which was appointed i a herald and an apostle   the truth i am speaking;
54.2.7.2^not i do lie   a teacher of the gentiles, in faith and truth.
54.2.8.1^i desire therefore to pray the men in every place, lifting up holy hands, apart from anger and dissension.
54.2.9.1^likewise also women, in apparel respectable, with modesty and self-control, should adorn themselves, not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or clothing costly,
54.2.10.1^but with what is becoming to women professing the fear of god, through works good.
54.2.11.1^a woman in quietness let learn in all submissiveness.
54.2.12.1^to teach however, a woman not i do permit, nor to use authority over a man, but to be in quietness.
54.2.13.1^adam for first was formed, then eve.
54.2.14.1^and adam not was deceived;
54.2.14.2^- but the woman, having been deceived, into transgression has come.
54.2.15.1^she will be saved however through - childbearing, if they abide in faith and love and holiness, with self-restraint.
54.3.1.1^trustworthy is the saying:
54.3.1.2^if anyone overseership aspires to, of good a work he is desirous.
54.3.2.1^it behooves therefore the overseer above reproach to be, of one wife the husband, sober, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,
54.3.3.1^not given to wine, not a striker, but gentle, peaceable, not loving money,
54.3.4.1^the own house well managing, children having in submission, with all dignity
54.3.5.1^if but one the own household to manage not knows, how the church of god how will he care for?
54.3.6.1^not a novice, that not having been puffed up, into the judgment he might fall of the devil.
54.3.7.1^it behooves him now also a testimony good to have from those outside, so that not into reproach he might fall, and the snare of the devil.
54.3.8.1^deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued, not to wine much being given, not greedy of dishonest gain,
54.3.9.1^holding to the mystery of the faith with clear a conscience.
54.3.10.1^also these now, let them be tested first;
54.3.10.2^then let them serve, blameless being.
54.3.11.1^women likewise must be dignified, not slanderers, clear-minded, faithful in all things.
54.3.12.1^deacons let be of one wife husbands, their children well managing and the own households.
54.3.13.1^those for well having served, a standing for themselves good acquire, and great confidence in the faith that is in christ jesus.
54.3.14.1^these things to you i am writing, hoping to come to you in a short time,
54.3.15.1^if however i should delay, so that you may know how it behooves one in the household of god to conduct oneself, which is the church of god the living, the pillar and base of the truth.
54.3.16.1^and confessedly, great is the - of godliness mystery:
54.3.16.2^who was revealed in the flesh, was justified in the spirit, was seen by angels, was proclaimed among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory.
54.4.1.1^- but the spirit expressly states that in later times, will depart from some the faith, giving heed to spirits deceitful and teachings of demons,
54.4.2.1^in hypocrisy of speakers of lies, having been seared in the own conscience,
54.4.3.1^forbidding to marry, commanding to abstain from foods that - god created for reception with thanksgiving by the faithful and those knowing the truth.
54.4.4.1^for every creature of god is good, and nothing is to be rejected, with thanksgiving being received;
54.4.5.1^it is sanctified for by the word of god and prayer.
54.4.6.1^these things laying before the brothers, good you will be a servant of christ jesus, being nourished in the words of the faith and of the good teaching that you have closely followed.
54.4.7.1^- but profane and silly fables refuse.
54.4.7.2^train rather yourself to godliness.
54.4.8.1^- for bodily exercise of a little is profit, - but godliness for everything profitable is, the promise holding of life of the present, and of the one coming.
54.4.9.1^trustworthy is the saying, and of full acceptance worthy.
54.4.10.1^for this for we toil and strive, because we have hope on god the living, who is the savior of all men, especially of believers.
54.4.11.1^command these things and teach.
54.4.12.1^no one your - youth let despise, but a pattern be for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.
54.4.13.1^until i come, give heed to the public reading of scripture, to exhortation, to teaching.
54.4.14.1^not be negligent of the in you gift, which was given to you through prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the elderhood.
54.4.15.1^these things ponder;
54.4.15.2^in them be absorbed, so that your - progress evident may be to all.
54.4.16.1^give heed to yourself and to the teaching.
54.4.16.2^continue in them, this for doing, both yourself you will save and those hearing you.
54.5.1.1^an elder not do rebuke, but exhort him as a father;
54.5.1.2^younger men as brothers;
54.5.2.1^elder women as mothers;
54.5.2.2^and younger women as sisters, in all purity.
54.5.3.1^widows honor, who are truly widows.
54.5.4.1^if however any widow, children or grandchildren has, let them learn first to the own household to be devout and recompense to give to parents;
54.5.4.2^this for is pleasing before - god.
54.5.5.1^she who is now indeed a widow, and being left alone, has hope in god, and continues - in supplications and - prayers night and day.
54.5.6.1^she however living in self-indulgence, while living is dead.
54.5.7.1^also these things command, so that above reproach they should be.
54.5.8.1^if now anyone the own, and especially his household, not does provide for, the faith he has denied, and he is than an unbeliever worse.
54.5.9.1^a widow let be enrolled not less than years old sixty, being of one man the wife,
54.5.10.1^in works good being borne witness to, if she has brought up children, if she entertained strangers, if saints  feet she has washed, if to those being oppressed she has imparted relief, if every work good she has followed after.
54.5.11.1^younger however widows refuse;
54.5.11.2^when for they might grow wanton against - christ, to marry they desire,
54.5.12.1^incurring judgment because the first faith they have cast off.
54.5.13.1^at the same time then also to be idle they learn, going about - house to house;
54.5.13.2^not only then idle, but also gossips and busybodies, speaking things not being proper.
54.5.14.1^i want therefore the younger ones to marry, to bear children, to manage their households, no occasion to give the one opposing of reproach on account.
54.5.15.1^already for some have turned aside after - satan.
54.5.16.1^if any believing woman has dependent widows, let her impart relief to them, and not let be burdened the church, so that to those who are truly widows it may impart relief.
54.5.17.1^the well ruling elders, of double honor let be counted worthy, especially those straining in the word and the teaching.
54.5.18.1^says for the scripture, an ox treading out grain not you shall muzzle,  and, worthy is the workman of the wages of him.
54.5.19.1^against an elder an accusation not do receive, except if not upon two or three witnesses.
54.5.20.1^those sinning before, all rebuke, so that also the rest, fear might have.
54.5.21.1^i earnestly testify before - god and christ jesus and the elect angels that these things you should keep, apart from prejudice, nothing doing out of partiality.
54.5.22.1^hands hastily on no one lay, nor share in the sins of others;
54.5.22.2^yourself pure keep.
54.5.23.1^no longer drink only water, but wine a little use, because of the stomach and the frequent of you ailments.
54.5.24.1^of some men the sins manifest are, going before them to judgment;
54.5.24.2^of some however also they appear later.
54.5.25.1^likewise also, the works - good are evident, and even those otherwise being, to be concealed not able.
54.6.1.1^as many as are under a yoke as slaves, the own masters of all honor worthy let them esteem, so that not the name - of god and the teaching should be blasphemed.
54.6.2.1^those now believing having masters, not let them despise them because brothers they are;
54.6.2.2^but rather let them serve them, because believing ones they are, and beloved, - by the good service being helped.
54.6.2.3^these things teach and exhort.
54.6.3.1^if anyone teaches another doctrine and not draws near the being sound words - of the lord of us jesus christ and the according to godliness teaching,
54.6.4.1^he is puffed up, nothing knowing but unhealthy about controversies and disputes about words, out of which come envy, strife, slander, suspicions evil,
54.6.5.1^and constant frictions corrupted among men - in mind, and destitute of the truth, holding a means of gain to be - godliness.
54.6.6.1^is however gain great - godliness with contentment.
54.6.7.1^nothing for we brought into the world, because neither to carry out anything are we able.
54.6.8.1^having however sustenance and coverings, with these we will be content.
54.6.9.1^those however desiring to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and desires many foolish and harmful, which plunge - men into ruin and destruction.
54.6.10.1^a root for of all kinds - of evils is the love of money, which some stretching after have been seduced away from the faith, and themselves have pierced with sorrows many.
54.6.11.1^you however, o man of god, these things flee;
54.6.11.2^pursue now righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and gentleness.
54.6.12.1^fight the good fight of the faith.
54.6.12.2^lay hold of the eternal life, to which you were called, and also did confess the good confession before many witnesses.
54.6.13.1^i charge you before - god, the one giving life to all things, and christ jesus, the one having testified before pontius pilate the good confession,
54.6.14.1^to keep you the commandment without stain, above reproach, until the appearing of the lord of us jesus christ,
54.6.15.1^which seasons in the own he will display, the blessed and alone sovereign, the king of those being kings, and the lord of those being lords,
54.6.16.1^- alone having immortality, in light dwelling unapproachable, whom has seen no one of men nor to see is able, to whom be honor and dominion eternal.
54.6.16.2^amen.
54.6.17.1^to the rich in the present age, instruct them not to be high-minded, nor to have hope in of riches the uncertainty, but on god the one providing us all things richly for enjoyment,
54.6.18.1^to do good, to be rich in works good, generous in distributing to be, ready to share,
54.6.19.1^treasuring up for themselves a foundation good for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is indeed life.

55.1.7.1^not for has given us - god a spirit of cowardice, but of power, and of love, and of self-control.
55.1.8.1^not therefore you should be ashamed of the testimony of the lord of us, nor of me the prisoner of him;
55.1.8.2^but suffer together for the gospel, according to the power of god,
55.1.9.1^the one having saved us, and having called us with a calling holy, not according to the works of us, but according to his own purpose and grace, - having been given us in christ jesus before time eternal,
55.1.10.1^having been made manifest also now by the appearing of the savior of us, christ jesus, having abolished indeed - death, having brought to light now life and immortality, through the gospel,
55.1.11.1^to which was appointed i a herald, and an apostle, and a teacher.
55.1.12.1^for this reason also these things i suffer.
55.1.12.2^but not i am ashamed;

55.2.15.1^hasten yourself, approved to present - to god a workman not ashamed, accurately handling the word - of truth.
55.2.16.1^- but worldly, empty babblings avoid, on to more for they will lead ungodliness,

55.2.18.1^who concerning the truth have gone astray, asserting the resurrection already to have taken place;
55.2.18.2^and they are overthrowing the of some faith.

55.2.21.1^if therefore anyone shall have cleansed himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, having been sanctified, useful to the master, for every work good having been prepared.
55.2.22.1^- and youthful lusts flee;
55.2.22.2^pursue now righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those calling on the lord out of pure a heart.
55.2.23.1^- and foolish and ignorant speculations refuse, knowing that they breed quarrels.
55.2.24.1^the bond-servant now of the lord, not it behooves to quarrel, but gentle to be toward all, able to teach, forbearing,
55.2.25.1^in gentleness disciplining those opposing, lest ever may give them - god repentance, unto a knowledge of the truth,
55.2.26.1^and they might come to their senses out of the of the devil snare, having been captured by him for - his will.
55.3.1.1^this however realize, that in the last days will be present times difficult.

56.3.4.1^when however the kindness and the love of mankind appeared, of the savior of us, god,
56.3.5.1^not by works - in righteousness that did we, but according to - his mercy, he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the spirit holy,

57.1.3.1^grace to you and peace from god father of us and the lord jesus christ.
57.1.4.1^i thank the god of me always, mention of you making upon the prayers of me,
57.1.5.1^hearing of your - love and the faith that you have toward the lord jesus and toward all the saints,
57.1.6.1^so that the fellowship of the faith of you, effective might become in the acknowledgment of every good thing that is in us, in christ.
57.1.7.1^joy for great i have, and encouragement by occasion of the love of you, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother.
57.1.8.1^therefore much in christ boldness having, to order you what is befitting,
57.1.9.1^for the sake of - love, rather i exhort you, such a one being, as paul aged, now then also a prisoner of christ jesus.
57.1.10.1^i exhort you for - my child, whom i have begotten in - chains, onesimus,
57.1.11.1^- once to you useless, now however both to you and to me useful,
57.1.12.1^whom i have sent back to you in person   he who is - my very heart
57.1.13.1^whom i was wishing with myself to keep, so that on behalf of you, me he might serve in the chains of the gospel.
57.1.14.1^apart from however - your consent, nothing i wished to do, so that not as according to necessity, the good of you may be, but according to willingness.
57.1.15.1^perhaps for because of this, he was separated from you for a time, so that eternally him you might possess,
57.1.16.1^no longer as a slave, but above a slave, a brother beloved, especially to me, how much however more to you, both in the flesh and in the lord.
57.1.17.1^if therefore me you consider a partner, receive him as me.
57.1.18.1^if however in any way he has wronged you, or he owes you, this to me charge.
57.1.19.1^i paul did write with my own hand.
57.1.19.2^i will repay it;
57.1.19.3^that not i may say to you, that even yourself to me you owe also.
57.1.20.1^yes, brother, i from you may have profit in the lord.
57.1.20.2^refresh my - heart in christ.
57.1.21.1^being persuaded of the obedience of you, i write to you, knowing that even above what i say, you will do.
57.1.22.1^at the same time now, also prepare for me a lodging;
57.1.22.2^i hope for that through the prayers of you, i will be granted to you.
57.1.23.1^greets you epaphras, - fellow prisoner my in christ jesus,
57.1.24.1^as do mark, aristarchus, demas, and luke, the fellow workers of me.
57.1.25.1^the grace of the lord jesus christ be with the spirit of you.
58.1.1.1^in many portions and in many ways, long ago - god having spoken to the fathers in the prophets,
58.1.2.1^in last - days these has spoken to us in his son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the ages,
58.1.3.1^who being the radiance of his glory and the exact expression of the substance of him, upholding then - all things by the word of the power of himself, the purification - of sins having made, sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high.
58.1.4.1^by so much superior having become to the angels, as much as more excellent beyond theirs, he has inherited a name.
58.1.5.1^to which for did he say ever of the angels:
58.1.5.2^son of me are you;
58.1.5.3^i today have begotten you?
58.1.5.4^and again:
58.1.5.5^i will be to him for a father, and he will be to me for a son?
58.1.6.1^when then again he brings the firstborn into the world, he says:
58.1.6.2^and let worship him all the angels of god.
58.1.7.1^and as to indeed the angels he says:
58.1.7.2^the one making the angels of him winds, and the ministers of him, of fire a flame.
58.1.8.1^unto however the son:
58.1.8.2^the throne of you, o god, is to the age of the age, and the scepter of righteousness is the scepter of the kingdom of you.
58.1.9.1^you have loved righteousness and have hated wickedness;
58.1.9.2^because of this, has anointed you - god, the god of you, with the oil of exultation, above the companions of you.
58.1.10.1^and:
58.1.10.2^you in the beginning, lord, of the earth laid the foundation, and works of the hands of you are the heavens.
58.1.11.1^they will perish;
58.1.11.2^you however remain;
58.1.11.3^and all like a garment will grow old;
58.1.12.1^and like a robe you will roll up them, like a garment also they will be changed;
58.1.12.2^you however the same are, and the years of you not will never end.
58.1.13.1^to which now of the angels did he say ever:
58.1.13.2^sit at the right hand of me, until - i may place the enemies of you as a footstool for the feet of you
58.1.14.1^not all are they ministering spirits, for service being sent forth, for the sake of those being about to inherit salvation?
58.2.1.1^because of this, it behooves more abundantly to give heed us to the things we have heard, lest ever we should drift away.
58.2.2.1^if for the by angels having been spoken word was unalterable, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense,
58.2.3.1^how we will escape such a great having neglected a salvation, which a commencement having received, declared by the lord, by those having heard, to us it was confirmed,
58.2.4.1^bearing witness - god by signs together with them and wonders, and by various miracles, and of the spirit holy distributions, according to the of him will.
58.2.5.1^not for to angels did he subject the world that is coming, of which we are speaking.
58.2.6.1^has testified however somewhere someone, saying, what is man, that you are mindful of him, or the son of man, that you care for him?
58.2.7.1^you made lower him a little some than the angels;
58.2.7.2^with glory and honor you crowned him,
58.2.8.1^all things you have put in subjection under the feet of him.
58.2.8.2^in - for subjecting to him - all things, nothing he left to him unsubject.
58.2.8.3^at present however, not yet do we see to him - all things having been subjected.
58.2.9.1^who however a little one than the angels, having been made lower, we see, jesus, because of the suffering - of death, with glory and with honor having been crowned, so that by the grace of god for everyone he might taste death.
58.2.10.1^it was fitting for to him, for whom are - all things and by whom are - all things, many sons to glory having brought, the archetype of the salvation of them, through sufferings to make perfect.
58.2.11.1^the one both for sanctifying, and those being sanctified, of one are all;
58.2.11.2^for which reason, not he is ashamed brothers them to call,
58.2.12.1^saying:
58.2.12.2^i will declare the name of you to the brothers of me;
58.2.12.3^in the midst of the congregation i will sing praises of you.
58.2.13.1^and again:
58.2.13.2^i will be trusting in him.
58.2.13.3^and again:
58.2.13.4^behold, i and the children whom to me has given - god.
58.2.14.1^since therefore the children have partaken of blood and of flesh also, he likewise took part in the same things, so that through his death, he might destroy the one the power holding - of death, that is, the devil,
58.2.15.1^and might set free those who fear of death through all their time to live, subject were to slavery.
58.2.16.1^not for surely in that place the angels he helps, but the seed of abraham he helps.
58.2.17.1^therefore it behooved him in all things his brothers to be made like, so that a merciful he might become, and faithful, high priest in things relating to - god, in order - to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
58.2.18.1^in that for has suffered he himself, having been tempted, he is able those being tempted to help.
58.3.1.1^therefore, brothers holy, of the calling heavenly partakers, carefully consider the apostle and high priest of the confession of us, jesus,
58.3.2.1^faithful being to the one having appointed him, as also moses in all the house of him.
58.3.3.1^of greater for he glory than moses has been counted worthy, by so much as greater honor has than the house itself, the one having built it.
58.3.4.1^every for house is built by someone;
58.3.4.2^the one however everything having built is god.
58.3.5.1^and moses indeed was faithful in all the house of him as a servant, unto a testimony of the things going to be spoken;
58.3.6.1^christ however as the son over the house of him, whose house are we, if indeed our confidence, and the boast of our hope, we should hold.
58.3.7.1^therefore, just as says the spirit - holy:
58.3.7.2^today if the voice of him you should hear,
58.3.8.1^not harden the hearts of you, as in the rebellion, in the day - of testing in the wilderness,
58.3.9.1^where tried me the fathers of you by testing, and saw the works of me
58.3.10.1^forty years.
58.3.10.2^therefore i was angry with the generation that, and i said, always they go astray - in the heart of them;
58.3.10.3^and not have they known the ways of me;
58.3.11.1^so i swore in the wrath of me, not shall they enter into the rest of me.
58.3.12.1^take heed, brothers, lest ever there will be in any of you a heart evil of unbelief, into - falling away from god the living.
58.3.13.1^but encourage other each every day, while - - today it is called, so that not may be hardened one of you by the deceitfulness - of sin.
58.3.14.1^partakers for - of christ we have become, if indeed from the beginning the assurance unto the end firm we should hold.
58.3.15.1^as - it is said:
58.3.15.2^today if the voice of him you should hear, not harden the hearts of you, as in the rebellion.
58.3.16.1^who for were those having heard, rebelled, but not all those having come out of egypt by the leading of moses?
58.3.17.1^with whom now was he indignant forty years, if not with those having sinned, whose - bodies fell in the wilderness?
58.3.18.1^to whom then did he swear that not shall they enter into the rest of him, if not to those having disobeyed?
58.3.19.1^and we see that not they were able to enter in because of unbelief.
58.4.1.1^we should fear therefore, lest ever left remaining, of the promise to enter into the rest of him, should seem any of you to have fallen short.
58.4.2.1^and for we are those having had the gospel preached just as they did;
58.4.2.2^but not did profit the message of their hearing them, not having been united with the faith of those having heard.
58.4.3.1^we enter for into the rest, those having believed;
58.4.3.2^as he has said:
58.4.3.3^so i swore in the wrath of me, not shall they enter into the rest of me.
58.4.3.4^and yet the works from the foundation of the world have been finished.
58.4.4.1^he has spoken for somewhere concerning the seventh day in this way, and rested - god on the day - seventh from all the works of him.
58.4.5.1^and in this passage again, not shall they enter into the rest of me.
58.4.6.1^since therefore it remains for some to enter into it, and those formerly having received the good news, not did enter in because of disobedience,
58.4.7.1^again a certain he appoints day today, through david saying after so long a time, just as it has been said, today, if the voice of him you shall hear, not harden the hearts of you.
58.4.8.1^if for to them joshua had given rest, not - about another he would have spoken after this day.
58.4.9.1^so then there remains a sabbath rest for the people - of god.
58.4.10.1^the one for having entered into the rest of him, also he rested from the works of him, as from the own - god did.
58.4.11.1^we should be diligent therefore to enter into that - rest, so that not by the same anyone example should fall - of disobedience.
58.4.12.1^living is for the word - of god, and active, and sharper than any sword two-edged, even penetrating as far as the division of soul and spirit, of joints and also marrows, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
58.4.13.1^and not there is creature hidden before him;
58.4.13.2^all things however are uncovered and laid bare to the eyes of him to whom is our - reckoning.
58.4.14.1^having therefore a high priest great, having passed through the heavens, jesus, the son - of god, we should hold firmly to our confession.
58.4.15.1^not for have we a high priest not being able to sympathize with the weaknesses of us;
58.4.15.2^one having been tempted however in all things by the same way, without sin.
58.4.16.1^we should come therefore with boldness to the throne - of grace, so that we may receive mercy and grace may find for in time of need help.
58.5.1.1^every for high priest, from among men being taken, on behalf of men is appointed, in things relating to - god that he should offer gifts both and sacrifices for sins,
58.5.2.1^to exercise forbearance being able, with those being ignorant and going astray, since also he himself is encompassed by weakness;
58.5.3.1^and because of this he is obligated, just as for the people, so also for himself, to offer sacrifices for sins.
58.5.4.1^and not upon himself anyone takes the honor, but rather being called by - god, just as also aaron.
58.5.5.1^so also - christ not himself did glorify to become a high priest, but the one having said to him:
58.5.5.2^son of me are you, i today have begotten you.
58.5.6.1^just as also in another place he says:
58.5.6.2^you are a priest to the age, according to the order of melchizedek.
58.5.7.1^he in the days of the flesh of him, prayers both and supplications, to the one being able to save him from death, with crying loud and tears having offered up, and having been heard, because of - reverence,
58.5.8.1^though being a son, he learned from the things he suffered, - obedience,
58.5.9.1^and having been perfected, he became to all those obeying him, the author of salvation eternal,
58.5.10.1^having been designated by - god a high priest according to the order of melchizedek.
58.5.11.1^concerning this there is much from us - speech, and difficult in interpretation to speak, since sluggish you have become in the hearings.
58.5.12.1^even for you ought to be teachers by the time, again need of you have one to teach you what is the principles of the beginning of the oracles - of god;
58.5.12.2^and you have become need those having of milk, and not of solid food.
58.5.13.1^everyone for - partaking only of milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness;
58.5.13.2^an infant for he is;
58.5.14.1^for the mature however is - solid food, the ones by - constant use the senses training having for distinguishing good both and evil.
58.6.1.1^therefore, having left the - beginning of the christ teaching, to - maturity we should go on, not again a foundation laying of repentance from dead works, and faith in god,
58.6.2.1^about baptisms instruction, of laying on then of hands, of the resurrection both of the dead and of judgment eternal.
58.6.3.1^and this we will do, if permits - god.
58.6.4.1^it is impossible for to those once having been enlightened, having tasted then of the gift - heavenly, and partakers having become of the spirit holy,
58.6.5.1^and the goodness having tasted of god s word, the power also of the coming age
58.6.6.1^and then having fallen away   again to restore them to repentance, crucifying in themselves the son - of god and subjecting him to open shame.
58.6.7.1^land for - having drunk in the upon it coming often rain, and producing vegetation useful for those for the sake of whom also it is tilled, partakes of blessing from - god.
58.6.8.1^that bringing forth however thorns and thistles is worthless and a curse near to, of which the end is unto burning.
58.6.9.1^we are persuaded however concerning you, beloved, of better things, and things accompanying salvation, if even like this we speak.
58.6.10.1^not for unjust is - god, to forget the work of you and the love that you have shown toward the name of him, having ministered to the saints and still ministering.
58.6.11.1^we desire now, each of you the same to show, earnestness, toward the full assurance of the hope unto the end,
58.6.12.1^so that not sluggish you may be, imitators however of those through faith and patience inheriting the promises.
58.6.13.1^- for to abraham having made his promise, - god, since by no one he had greater to swear, he swore by himself,
58.6.14.1^saying, if surely blessing i will bless you, and multiplying i will multiply you.
58.6.15.1^and thus having waited patiently, he obtained the promise.
58.6.16.1^men for by one greater swear, and of all their disputes an end, for confirmation, is the oath,
58.6.17.1^in which more abundantly desiring - god to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of the purpose of him, guaranteed it by an oath,
58.6.18.1^so that by two things unchangeable, in which it is impossible to lie - for god, strong encouragement we may have, - having fled for refuge, to take hold of the being set before us hope,
58.6.19.1^which as an anchor we have of the soul, sure both and unshakable and entering into that within the veil,
58.6.20.1^where the forerunner for us has entered, jesus, according to the order of melchizedek, a high priest having become to the age.
58.7.1.1^this for - melchizedek, king of salem, priest - of god - most high, - having met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and having blessed him,
58.7.2.1^is he to whom also a tenth of all apportioned abraham, first indeed being translated, king of righteousness;
58.7.2.2^then and also, king of salem, which is, king of peace.
58.7.3.1^without father, without mother, without genealogy, neither beginning of days nor of life end having, having been made like however the son - of god, he remains a priest unto - all time.
58.7.4.1^consider now how great this one was, to whom even a tenth abraham gave out of the best spoils, the patriarch.
58.7.5.1^and those indeed, out from the sons of levi, the priestly office receiving, a commandment have to take a tenth from the people according to the law, that is, from the brothers of them, though having come out of the loin of abraham.
58.7.6.1^the one however not tracing his ancestry from them has collected a tenth from abraham, and the one having the promises has blessed.
58.7.7.1^apart from now all dispute, the inferior by the superior is blessed.
58.7.8.1^and here indeed tithes, dying men receive;
58.7.8.2^in that place however, it is testified that he lives on.
58.7.9.1^and so, a word to speak, through abraham also, levi, the one tithes receiving, paid the tithe.
58.7.10.1^still for in the loin of his father he was, when met him melchizedek.
58.7.11.1^if indeed then perfection by the levitical priesthood were   the people for upon it had received the law   what still need was there, according to the order of melchizedek, for another to arise priest and not according to the order of aaron to be named?
58.7.12.1^being changed for of the priesthood, from necessity also, of law a change takes place.
58.7.13.1^he concerning whom for are said these things a tribe another belonged to, from which no one has served at the altar.
58.7.14.1^it is evident for that out of judah has sprung the lord of us, as to which a tribe, concerning priests, nothing moses spoke.
58.7.15.1^and more abundantly yet evident it is, if according to the likeness of melchizedek arises a priest another,
58.7.16.1^who not according to a law of a commandment fleshly has been constituted, but according to the power of a life indestructible.
58.7.17.1^it is testified for -:
58.7.17.2^you are a priest to the age, according to the order of melchizedek.
58.7.18.1^a putting away indeed for there is of the preceding commandment, because of - its weakness and uselessness
58.7.19.1^nothing for perfected the law   the introduction then of a better hope, by which we draw near - to god.
58.7.20.1^and to as much as not apart from an oath, those ones truly for without an oath are priests becoming,
58.7.21.1^he however with an oath, through the one saying to him:
58.7.21.2^has sworn the lord, and not will change his mind, you are a priest to the age.
58.7.22.1^by so much also of a better covenant has become the guarantee jesus.
58.7.23.1^and those indeed many are having become priests, because of - by death being prevented from continuing.
58.7.24.1^- but because of the abiding of him to the age, a permanent he holds - priesthood,
58.7.25.1^wherefore also, to save to the uttermost he is able, those drawing near through him - to god, always living for - to intercede for them.
58.7.26.1^such indeed for us also was fitting a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, having been separated from - sinners, and higher than the heavens having become,
58.7.27.1^who not has every day need, as the high priests, first for the own sins, sacrifices to offer up, then for those of the people;
58.7.27.2^this for he did once for all, himself having offered up.
58.7.28.1^the law for men appoints as high priests, having weakness;
58.7.28.2^the word however of the oath, which is after the law, a son to the age, having been perfected.
58.8.1.1^the sum now of the things being spoken of is that such we have, a high priest who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens,
58.8.2.1^in the holy places a minister, and in the tabernacle - true, which has pitched the lord, not man.
58.8.3.1^every for high priest, in order - to offer gifts both, and sacrifices, is appointed;
58.8.3.2^wherefore it was necessary to have something also for this one that he might offer.
58.8.4.1^if certainly then he were on earth, not even - would he be a priest, there being those offering according to law the gifts,
58.8.5.1^who a copy and shadow serve of the heavenly, as was divinely instructed moses, being about to complete the tabernacle.
58.8.5.2^see that,  for he says, you shall make all things according to the pattern - having been shown you in the mountain.
58.8.6.1^now, however, more excellent he has obtained a ministry, as much as also of a better he is covenant the mediator, which upon better promises has been enacted.
58.8.7.1^if for the first that had been faultless, not - for a second would have been sought a place.
58.8.8.1^finding fault for with them, he says:
58.8.8.2^behold, the days are coming, says the lord, and i will ratify with the house of israel and with the house of judah, a covenant new,
58.8.9.1^not according to the covenant that i made with fathers of them, in the day of having taken hold of by me the hand of them, to lead them out of the land of egypt, because they not did continue in the covenant of me, and i disregarded them, says the lord.
58.8.10.1^for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel, after the days those, says the lord, putting laws of me into the mind of them, and upon hearts of them i will inscribe them;
58.8.10.2^and i will be to them for god, and they will be to me for a people.
58.8.11.1^and no not shall they teach each the neighbor of him, and each the brother of him saying, know the lord,  because all will know me, from the least to the greatest of them,
58.8.12.1^because merciful i will be toward the iniquities of them, and the sins of them no not i shall remember more.
58.8.13.1^in - saying, new, he has made obsolete the first;
58.8.13.2^that then growing old and aging is near vanishing.
58.9.1.1^had indeed therefore also the first, regulations of worship - and a sanctuary earthly.
58.9.2.1^a tabernacle for was prepared, the first room   in which were - both the lampstand, and the table, and of the presentation the bread   which is called the holy place.
58.9.3.1^behind now the second veil was a tabernacle, - being called the holy of holies,
58.9.4.1^the golden having altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant, having been covered around in every part with gold, in which was the jar golden having the manna, and the staff of aaron - having budded, and the tablets of the covenant.
58.9.5.1^above then it were the cherubim of glory, overshadowing the mercy seat;
58.9.5.2^concerning which not it is now the time to speak in detail.
58.9.6.1^these things now thus having been prepared, into indeed the first tabernacle at all times everything enter the priests, the sacred services accomplishing.
58.9.7.1^enters into however the second, once in the year only, the high priest, not without blood, which he offers for himself and the of the people sins of ignorance.
58.9.8.1^by this was signifying the spirit - holy that not yet has been made manifest the into the holy places way, still the first tabernacle having a standing,
58.9.9.1^which is a symbol for the time - present, in which gifts both and sacrifices are offered, not being able in regard to conscience to make perfect the one worshiping,
58.9.10.1^consisting only in foods and drinks and various washings, ordinances of the flesh, until the time of reformation being imposed.
58.9.11.1^christ however, having appeared as high priest of the having come good things, by the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made by hands, that is, not of this - creation,
58.9.12.1^nor by blood of goats and calves, through however the own blood, he entered once for all into the holy places, eternal redemption having obtained.
58.9.13.1^if for the blood of goats, and of bulls, and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling the having been defiled, sanctify them for the of the flesh purification,
58.9.14.1^how much more the blood - of christ, who through the spirit eternal, himself offered unblemished - to god, will purify the conscience of us from dead works, in order - to serve god the living!
58.9.15.1^and because of this, of a covenant new the mediator he is, so that, death having taken place, for redemption of the under the first covenant transgressions, the promise might receive those having been called, of the eternal inheritance.
58.9.16.1^where for there is a will, the death it is necessary to establish of the one having made it.
58.9.17.1^a will for after death is affirmed, since not at the time it is in force, when is living the one having made it,
58.9.18.1^wherefore neither the first, apart from blood has been inaugurated.
58.9.19.1^having been spoken for of every commandment according to the law by moses to all the people, having taken the blood - of calves and - of goats, with water, and wool scarlet, and hyssop, itself both the book and all the people he sprinkled,
58.9.20.1^saying, this is the blood of the covenant, which commanded unto you - god.
58.9.21.1^and the tabernacle then, and all the vessels of the ministry with blood likewise he sprinkled.
58.9.22.1^and almost with blood all things are purified, according to the law, and apart from blood-shedding, not there is forgiveness.
58.9.23.1^it was necessary then for the indeed representations of the things in the heavens, with these to be purified, themselves however the heavenly things with better sacrifices than these.
58.9.24.1^not for into made by hands has entered holy places christ, copies of the true ones, but into itself - heaven, now to appear in the presence - of god for us,
58.9.25.1^nor that repeatedly he should offer himself, just as the high priest enters into the holy places every year with the blood of another.
58.9.26.1^otherwise it was necessary for him repeatedly to have suffered from the foundation of the world.
58.9.26.2^now however once in the consummation of the ages, for the putting away of sin, by the sacrifice of himself he has been revealed.
58.9.27.1^and in as much as it is apportioned - to men once to die, after then this to face judgment,
58.9.28.1^so also - christ, once having been offered in order - of many to bear the sins, for a second time, apart from sin, will appear to those him awaiting for salvation.
58.10.1.1^a shadow for having the law of the coming good things, not themselves the form of the things, each year with the same sacrifices, which they offer to the continuous, never is able those drawing near to perfect.
58.10.2.1^otherwise not - would they have ceased being offered, because of - none having any longer conscience of sins, those serving once having been cleansed?
58.10.3.1^but in these, there is a reminder of sins every year.
58.10.4.1^impossible it is indeed for the blood of bulls and of goats to take away sins.
58.10.5.1^therefore coming into the world, he says:
58.10.5.2^sacrifice and offering not you have desired, a body however you have prepared me.
58.10.6.1^burnt offerings and offerings for sin not you have delighted in.
58.10.7.1^then i said, behold, i have come   in the scroll of the book it is written of me   - to do, - o god, the will of you.
58.10.8.1^above saying -, sacrifice, and offering, and burnt offerings, and offerings for sin, not you have desired, nor have you delighted in,  which according to the law are offered;
58.10.9.1^then he said, behold, i have come - to do the will of you.
58.10.9.2^he takes away the first, that the second he might establish.
58.10.10.1^by that will, having been sanctified we are, through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all.
58.10.11.1^and every indeed priest stands every day ministering, and the same repeatedly offering sacrifices, which never are able to take away sins.
58.10.12.1^this one however, one for sins having offered sacrifice in - perpetuity, sat down at the right hand - of god,
58.10.13.1^the henceforth awaiting until should be placed the enemies of him as a footstool for the feet of him.
58.10.14.1^by one for offering, he has perfected for - all time those being sanctified.
58.10.15.1^bears witness now to us also the spirit - holy;
58.10.15.2^after for - having said:
58.10.16.1^this is the covenant that i will make with them, after the days those, says the lord, putting the laws of me into the hearts of them, and into the mind of them, i will inscribe them,
58.10.17.1^and, the sins of them, and the lawless acts of them, no not will i remember any more.
58.10.18.1^where now forgiveness of these is, no longer is there an offering for sin.
58.10.19.1^having therefore, brothers, confidence for the entering the holy places by the blood of jesus,
58.10.20.1^which he dedicated for us a way new, and living, through the veil, that is, the flesh of him,
58.10.21.1^and having a priest great over the house - of god,
58.10.22.1^we should draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having been sprinkled clean our hearts from a conscience evil, and having been washed our body with water pure.
58.10.23.1^we should hold fast to the confession of our hope, firmly;
58.10.23.2^faithful for is the one having promised.
58.10.24.1^and we should think one another, toward stirring up to love and to good works,
58.10.25.1^not forsaking the assembling together of ourselves as is the custom with some, but encouraging one another, and so much more as you see drawing near the day.
58.10.26.1^if willingly for, sin we, after we are - to receive the knowledge of the truth, no longer for sins remains a sacrifice,
58.10.27.1^terrifying however a certain expectation of judgment and of fire fury to devour being about the adversaries.
58.10.28.1^having set aside anyone the law of moses, without mercies on the basis of two or three witnesses, he dies.
58.10.29.1^how much think you worse will he deserve punishment, the one the son - of god having trampled upon, and the blood of the covenant ordinary having esteemed, by which he was sanctified, and the spirit - of grace having insulted?
58.10.30.1^we know for the one having said, mine is vengeance;
58.10.30.2^i will repay,  and again, will judge the lord the people of him.
58.10.31.1^it is a fearful thing - to fall into the hands of god the living.
58.10.32.1^remember however the former days in which, having been enlightened, a great conflict you endured of sufferings,
58.10.33.1^this indeed, by revilings both and tribulations being made a spectacle;
58.10.33.2^this now, partners of those thus passing through them having become.
58.10.34.1^both for with the prisoners you sympathized, and the plundering of the possessions of you with joy you accepted, knowing to have yourselves a better possession, and abiding.
58.10.35.1^not throw away therefore the boldness of you, which has a great reward.
58.10.36.1^of endurance for you have need, so that, the will - of god having done, you may receive the promise.
58.10.37.1^yet for, a little very while, the one coming will come, and not will delay.
58.10.38.1^the one however righteous of mine by faith will live;
58.10.38.2^and if he might shrink back, not takes pleasure the soul of me in him.
58.10.39.1^we however not are of those drawing back to destruction, but of faith to the preserving of the soul.
58.11.1.1^is now faith of things hoped for the assurance, of things the conviction not being seen.
58.11.2.1^in this for were commended the ancients.
58.11.3.1^by faith we understand to have been formed the universe by the word of god, so that which not from things being visible, the things being seen have been made.
58.11.4.1^by faith a more excellent sacrifice abel than cain offered - to god, through which he was testified to be righteous, bearing witness to the gifts of him - god;
58.11.4.2^and through it, having died, still he speaks.
58.11.5.1^by faith enoch was translated, - not to see death;
58.11.5.2^and not was he found, because had taken up him - god.
58.11.5.3^before for the translation, he was commended to have pleased - god.
58.11.6.1^without now faith, it is impossible to please him.
58.11.6.2^to believe for it behooves the one drawing near - to god, that he exists, and that to those earnestly seeking out him, a rewarder he becomes.
58.11.7.1^by faith having been divinely instructed noah concerning the things not yet seen, having been moved with fear, prepared an ark for the salvation of the household of him, by which he condemned the world, and of the according to faith righteousness that is, he became heir.
58.11.8.1^by faith being called, abraham obeyed to go out into a place that he was going to receive for an inheritance, and went out, not knowing where he is going.
58.11.9.1^by faith he sojourned in the land of the promise, as in a foreign country, in tents having dwelt with isaac and jacob, the joint-heirs of the promise - same.
58.11.10.1^he was awaiting for the - foundations having city, of which the architect and builder is - god.
58.11.11.1^by faith also, herself sarah barren, power for the conception of seed received, even beyond the opportune age, since faithful she considered the one having promised.
58.11.12.1^therefore also from one man were born, and he having been as good as dead, as the stars of heaven - in multitude, and as the sand - by the shore of the sea - countless.
58.11.13.1^in faith died these all, not having received the promises, but from afar them having seen, and having embraced them, and having confessed that strangers and sojourners they are on the earth.
58.11.14.1^those for such things saying make manifest that their own country they are seeking.
58.11.15.1^and if indeed that they had been remembering from where they came out, they would have had - opportunity to return.
58.11.16.1^now however a better one they stretch forward to, that is, a heavenly one.
58.11.16.2^therefore not is ashamed of them - god, god to be called of them;
58.11.16.3^he has prepared indeed for them a city.
58.11.17.1^by faith has offered up abraham - isaac.
58.11.17.2^being tested, even his only begotten son was offering up the one the promises having received,
58.11.18.1^as to whom it was said -, in isaac will be reckoned your offspring,
58.11.19.1^having reasoned that even out from the dead to raise , able was - god, from where him also in a simile, he received.
58.11.20.1^by faith also concerning the things coming, blessed isaac - jacob and - esau.
58.11.21.1^by faith jacob, dying, each of the sons of joseph blessed, and worshiped on the top of the staff of him.
58.11.22.1^by faith joseph, dying, concerning the exodus of the sons of israel made mention, and concerning the bones of him gave instructions.
58.11.23.1^by faith moses, having been born, was hidden three months by the parents of him, because they saw was beautiful the little child, and not they did fear the edict of the king.
58.11.24.1^by faith moses, grown having become, refused to be called the son of the daughter of pharaoh,
58.11.25.1^rather having chosen to suffer affliction with the people - of god than the temporary to have of sin enjoyment,
58.11.26.1^greater wealth having esteemed than the of egypt treasures the reproach - of christ;
58.11.26.2^he was looking for toward the reward.
58.11.27.1^by faith he left egypt, not having feared the anger of the king;
58.11.27.2^the for invisible one as seeing, he persevered.
58.11.28.1^by faith he has kept the passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that not the one destroying the firstborn would touch them.
58.11.29.1^by faith they passed through the red sea, as through dry land, which an attempt having made, the egyptians were swallowed up.
58.11.30.1^by faith the walls of jericho fell, having been encircled for seven days.
58.11.31.1^by faith rahab the prostitute not did perish with those having disobeyed, having received the spies with peace.
58.11.32.1^and what more shall i say?
58.11.32.2^will fail me for telling the time, of gideon, barak, samson, jephthah, david also, and samuel, and the prophets,
58.11.33.1^who by faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, obtained promises;
58.11.33.2^shut the mouths of lions,
58.11.34.1^quenched the power of fire, escaped the mouths of the sword;
58.11.34.2^acquired strength out of weakness, became mighty in war, the armies put to flight of foreigners.
58.11.35.1^received back women by resurrection the dead of them;
58.11.35.2^others then were tortured, not having accepted - release, so that a better resurrection they might obtain.
58.11.36.1^others then of mockings and of scourgings, trial received;
58.11.36.2^in addition, also of chains and imprisonment.
58.11.37.1^they were stoned, they were sawed in two, by slaughter of the sword they were killed;
58.11.37.2^they wandered in sheepskins, in goats  skins, being destitute, being oppressed, being mistreated;
58.11.38.1^of whom not was worthy the world;
58.11.38.2^in deserts wandering, and mountains, and caves, and - holes of the earth.
58.11.39.1^and these all, having been commended through the faith, not did receive the promise,
58.11.40.1^- god for us better something having planned, so that not apart from us they should be made perfect.
58.12.1.1^therefore also we, such a great having encompassing us a cloud of witnesses, weight having laid aside every, and the easily entangling sin, with endurance should run the lying before us race,
58.12.2.1^looking to the of our faith founder and perfecter, jesus, who in view of the lying before him joy, endured the cross, its shame having despised, at right hand and of the throne - of god sat down.
58.12.3.1^consider fully for, the one such great having endured from - sinners against himself hostility, so that not you shall grow weary, in the souls of you fainting.
58.12.4.1^not yet unto blood have you resisted, against - sin struggling,
58.12.5.1^and you have forgotten the exhortation that you as to sons addresses:
58.12.5.2^son of me, not regard lightly the discipline of the lord, nor faint, by him being reproved.
58.12.6.1^whom for he loves, the lord disciplines;
58.12.6.2^he scourges now every son whom he receives.
58.12.7.1^as discipline endure, as sons you is treating - god;
58.12.7.2^what for son is there whom not disciplines his father?
58.12.8.1^if however without you are of discipline, of which partakers they have become all, then illegitimate children and not sons you are.
58.12.9.1^furthermore - indeed of the flesh of us fathers we have had correctors, and we respected them;
58.12.9.2^not much and more shall we be in subjection to the father - of spirits, and shall live?
58.12.10.1^- truly indeed for a few days, according to that seeming good to them, they were disciplining us;
58.12.10.2^- but he for our benefitting, in order - to share of the holiness of him.
58.12.11.1^all now discipline, for indeed those being present, not seems of joy to be, but of grief;
58.12.11.2^afterward however, the fruit peaceable, to those by it having been trained, it yields of righteousness.
58.12.12.1^therefore the drooping hands and the enfeebled knees lift up,
58.12.13.1^and paths straight make for the feet of you, so that not the lame should be put out of joint, should be healed however rather.
58.12.14.1^peace pursue with all, and - holiness, which without no one will see the lord,
58.12.15.1^observing lest any be failing of the grace - of god, lest any root of bitterness up springing should trouble you, and by this, might be defiled many,
58.12.16.1^lest there be any fornicator or profane person, as esau, who for meal one sold the birthright of himself.
58.12.17.1^you know for that even afterward, wishing to inherit the blessing, he was rejected;
58.12.17.2^of repentance for place not he found, although with tears having earnestly sought it.
58.12.18.1^not for you have come to that being touched and having been kindled with fire, and to darkness, and to gloom, and to storm,
58.12.19.1^and of a trumpet to the sound, and to a voice of words, which those having heard excused themselves, asking not to be addressed to them the word,
58.12.20.1^not they could bear for that being commanded:
58.12.20.2^if even a beast should touch the mountain, it shall be stoned.
58.12.21.1^and so fearful was the thing appearing that moses said, greatly afraid i am, and trembling.
58.12.22.1^but you have come to zion mount, and the city of god the living, the jerusalem heavenly, and to myriads of angels, to the assembly,
58.12.23.1^and to the church of the firstborn having been enrolled in the heavens, and to the judge god of all, and to the spirits of the righteous having been perfected,
58.12.24.1^and of a covenant new the mediator, to jesus, and to the blood of sprinkling better things speaking than that of abel.
58.12.25.1^take heed lest you refuse the one speaking.
58.12.25.2^if for they not escaped, on earth having refused the one divinely instructing them, much less we - the one from the heavens turning away from,
58.12.26.1^whose - voice the earth shook at that time;
58.12.26.2^now however he has promised, saying, yet once more i will shake not only the earth, but also - heaven.
58.12.27.1^this now, yet once more, signifies the of the things being shaken removing, as having been created, so that should remain the things not being shaken.
58.12.28.1^therefore a kingdom not to be shaken receiving, we may have grace, by which we may serve well pleasingly - god, with reverence and awe.
58.12.29.1^also for the god of us is a fire consuming.
58.13.1.1^- brotherly love let abide.
58.13.2.1^- of hospitality not be forgetful;
58.13.2.2^through this for, unawares some have entertained angels.
58.13.3.1^remember - prisoners as being bound with them, those being mistreated as also yourselves being in the body.
58.13.4.1^honorable let - marriage be in all, and the marriage bed undefiled;
58.13.4.2^the sexually immoral for and adulterers will judge - god.
58.13.5.1^let be without covetousness your manner of life, being satisfied with the present;
58.13.5.2^he himself for has said:
58.13.5.3^never not you will i leave, nor never not you will i forsake.
58.13.6.1^so are confident we to say:
58.13.6.2^the lord is my helper, and not i will be afraid;
58.13.6.3^what shall do to me man?
58.13.7.1^remember those leading you, who spoke to you the word - of god, of whom, considering the outcome of their way of life, imitate the faith.
58.13.8.1^jesus christ yesterday and today is the same, and to the ages.
58.13.9.1^by teachings various and strange, not be carried away;
58.13.9.2^it is good for by grace to be strengthened for the heart, not foods, in which not were profited those being devoted.
58.13.10.1^we have an altar from which to eat, not have authority, those in the tabernacle serving.
58.13.11.1^whose for is brought of animals the blood as sacrifices for sin, into the holy places by the high priest;
58.13.11.2^of those the bodies are burned outside the camp.
58.13.12.1^therefore also jesus, so that he might sanctify by the own blood the people, outside the gate suffered.
58.13.13.1^therefore we should go forth to him outside the camp, the reproach of him bearing.
58.13.14.1^not for we have here an abiding city, but the coming one we are seeking for.
58.13.15.1^through him then we should offer the sacrifice of praise through everything to god, that is, the fruit of the lips confessing the name of him.
58.13.16.1^- and the good and of sharing, not be forgetful;
58.13.16.2^with such for sacrifices is well pleased - god.
58.13.17.1^obey those leading you, and be submissive;
58.13.17.2^they for watch over the souls of you, as account about to give;
58.13.17.3^that with joy this they might do, and not groaning, unprofitable indeed for you is this.
58.13.18.1^pray for us;
58.13.18.2^we are persuaded for that a good conscience we have, in all things well desiring to conduct ourselves.
58.13.19.1^more abundantly now i exhort you this to do, so that more quickly i may be restored to you.
58.13.20.1^may the now god - of peace, - having brought out from the dead the shepherd of the sheep - great, by the blood of the covenant eternal, the lord of us jesus,
58.13.21.1^equip you in everything good, in order - to do the will of him, working in us that which is well pleasing before him, through jesus christ, to whom be the glory to the ages of the ages.
58.13.21.2^amen.
58.13.22.1^i exhort now you, brothers, bear with the word - of exhortation;
58.13.22.2^only for in few words i have written to you.
58.13.23.1^you know the brother of us timothy has been released, with whom if sooner he should come, i will see you.
58.13.24.1^greet all those leading you, and all the saints.
58.13.24.2^greet you, those from - italy.
58.13.25.1^- grace be with all of you.
59.1.1.1^james, of god and of the lord jesus christ a servant, to the twelve tribes - in the dispersion:
59.1.1.2^greetings.
59.1.2.1^all joy esteem it, brothers of me, when trials you might fall into various,
59.1.3.1^knowing that the testing of your - faith produces endurance.
59.1.4.1^- and endurance, work its perfect let have, so that you may be perfect and complete, in nothing lacking.
59.1.5.1^if now any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask from the one giving, god, to all generously, and not finding fault, and it will be given to him.
59.1.6.1^let him ask however in faith, nothing doubting.
59.1.6.2^the one for doubting is like a wave of the sea, being blown by the wind and being tossed by the wind.
59.1.7.1^not for let suppose the man that, that he will receive anything from the lord.
59.1.8.1^he is a man double-minded, unstable in all the ways of him.
59.1.9.1^let boast however the brother - of low degree in the exaltation of him;
59.1.10.1^he who is then rich, in the humiliation of him, because like a flower of grass he will pass away.
59.1.11.1^has risen for the sun with its burning heat and withered the grass, and the flower of it has fallen, and the beauty of the appearance of it has perished.
59.1.11.2^thus also the rich man in the midst of the pursuits of him will fade away.
59.1.12.1^blessed is the man who endures trial, because approved having been, he will receive the crown - of life that he has promised to those loving him.
59.1.13.1^no one being tempted let say -, by god i am being tempted.
59.1.13.2^- for god unable to be tempted is by evils;
59.1.13.3^tempts now he himself no one.
59.1.14.1^a man however is tempted, by the own desire being drawn away and being enticed.
59.1.15.1^then - desire, having conceived, gives birth to sin;
59.1.15.2^- and sin having become fully grown, brings forth death.
59.1.16.1^not be misled, brothers my beloved.
59.1.17.1^every act of giving good, and every gift perfect, from above is, coming down from the father - of lights, with whom not there is variation or of shifting shadow.
59.1.18.1^having willed it, he brought forth us by the word of truth, for - to be us firstfruits a certain - of his creatures.
59.1.19.1^know this, brothers my beloved.
59.1.19.2^let be however every man swift unto - to hear, slow unto - to speak, slow unto anger;
59.1.20.1^the anger for of man, the righteousness of god not produces.
59.1.21.1^therefore, having put aside all filthiness and abounding of wickedness, in humility receive the implanted word, - being able to save the souls of you.
59.1.22.1^be however doers of the word, and not only, hearers deceiving yourselves,
59.1.23.1^because if anyone a hearer of the word is and not a doer, this one is like a man looking at the face - natural of him in a mirror;
59.1.24.1^he has viewed for himself and has gone away and immediately he has forgotten what like he was.
59.1.25.1^the one however having looked intently into the law perfect, that - of freedom, and having continued in it, not a hearer forgetful having been, but a doer of the work   this one blessed in the work of him will be.
59.1.26.1^if anyone seems religious to be, not bridling the tongue of himself, but deceiving the heart of himself, of this one worthless is the religion.
59.1.27.1^religion pure and undefiled before the god and father this is, to visit orphans and widows in the tribulation of them;
59.1.27.2^unstained oneself to keep from the world.
59.2.1.1^brothers of me, not with partiality hold the faith of the lord of us jesus christ - of glory.
59.2.2.1^if for might come into assembly of you a man with a gold ring in apparel splendid, might come in then also a poor man in shabby apparel,
59.2.3.1^you should look also upon the one wearing the apparel - splendid and should say, you sit you here honorably, and to the poor should say, you stand or, sit there, under the footstool of me,
59.2.4.1^then not have you made a distinction among yourselves and have become judges with thoughts evil?
59.2.5.1^listen, brothers my beloved.
59.2.5.2^not - god has chosen the poor - in this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom that he promised to those loving him?
59.2.6.1^you however have dishonored the poor.
59.2.6.2^not the rich are oppressing you and they dragging you into court?
59.2.7.1^not they are blaspheming the good name - having been called upon you?
59.2.8.1^if indeed the law you keep royal, according to the scripture, you shall love the neighbor of you as yourself,  well you are doing.
59.2.9.1^if however you show partiality, sin you are committing, being convicted by the law as transgressors.
59.2.10.1^whoever for all the law shall keep, shall stumble but in one point, he has become of all guilty.
59.2.11.1^the one for having said, not you shall commit adultery,  said also, not you shall murder.
59.2.11.2^if however not you do commit adultery, do commit murder however, you have become a transgressor of the law.
59.2.12.1^so speak and so act as by the law of freedom being about to be judged.
59.2.13.1^- for judgment without mercy will be to the one not having shown mercy.
59.2.13.2^triumphs over mercy judgment.
59.2.14.1^what is the profit, brothers of me, if faith says anyone to have, works however not he has?
59.2.14.2^not is able the faith to save him?
59.2.15.1^now if a brother or a sister without clothes is, and lacking is - of daily food,
59.2.16.1^says then anyone to them out from you, go in peace;
59.2.16.2^be warmed and be filled, not gives however to them the needful things for the body, what is the profit?
59.2.17.1^so also - faith, if not it has works, dead is, by itself.
59.2.18.1^but will say someone, you faith have, and i works have.
59.2.18.2^show me the faith of you without - works, and i you will show by the works of me, - faith.
59.2.19.1^you believe that one is - god.
59.2.19.2^well you are doing!
59.2.19.3^even the demons believe that, and shudder!
59.2.20.1^do you want however to come to know, o man foolish, that - faith apart from - works worthless is?
59.2.21.1^abraham the father of us, not by works was justified, having offered isaac the son of him upon the altar?
59.2.22.1^you see that his faith was working with the works of him, and by his works, his faith was perfected.
59.2.23.1^and was fulfilled the scripture - saying, believed then abraham - god, and it was counted to him for righteousness,  and a friend of god he was called.
59.2.24.1^you see that by works is justified a man, and not by faith alone.
59.2.25.1^likewise then also rahab the prostitute not by works was justified, having received the messengers and by another way having sent them forth?
59.2.26.1^just as for the body apart from spirit dead is, so also - faith apart from works dead is.
59.3.1.1^not many of you teachers let be, brothers of mine, knowing that greater judgment we will receive.
59.3.2.1^in many ways for we stumble all.
59.3.2.2^if anyone in what he says not does stumble, this one is a perfect man, able to bridle indeed all the body.
59.3.3.1^if now, of the horses - bits into the mouths we put for - to obey them us, even all the body of them we turn about.
59.3.4.1^behold, also the ships, so great being and by winds strong being driven, are turned about by a very small rudder wherever the impulse of the one steering resolves.
59.3.5.1^thus also the tongue a small member is, and exceeding things it boasts.
59.3.5.2^behold a small fire, how great a forest it kindles.
59.3.6.1^also the tongue is a fire, the world - of iniquity.
59.3.6.2^the tongue is set among the members of us, - defiling all the body, and setting on fire the course - of nature, and itself being set on fire by - hell.
59.3.7.1^all for kinds of beasts both and of birds, of creeping things both and things of the sea, is subdued and has been subdued by the race of the human,
59.3.8.1^- but the tongue no one to subdue is able of men;
59.3.8.2^it is an unruly evil, full of poison deadly.
59.3.9.1^with it we bless our lord and father, and with it we curse - men, those according to the likeness of god being made.
59.3.10.1^out of the same mouth proceed forth blessing and cursing.
59.3.10.2^not ought, brothers of me, these things so to be.
59.3.11.1^not the spring out of the same opening pours forth - both fresh and - bitter?
59.3.12.1^not is able, brothers of me, a fig tree olives to produce?
59.3.12.2^or a vine, figs?
59.3.12.3^nor a salt spring, fresh to produce water.
59.3.13.1^who is wise and understanding among you;
59.3.13.2^let him show out of the good conduct the works of him, in the humility of wisdom.
59.3.14.1^if however jealousy bitter you have, and self-interest in the heart of you, not boast of it and lie against the truth.
59.3.15.1^not is this the wisdom from above coming down, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.
59.3.16.1^where for jealousy and self-interest exist, there will be disorder and every evil thing.
59.3.17.1^- but the from above wisdom first indeed pure is, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and of fruits good, impartial, sincere.
59.3.18.1^the fruit now of righteousness in peace is sown by those making peace.
59.4.1.1^from where come disputes and from where quarrels among you?
59.4.1.2^is it not from there, out of the passions of you - warring in the members of you?
59.4.2.1^you desire, and not have;
59.4.2.2^you kill and covet, and not are able to obtain;
59.4.2.3^you quarrel and wrangle.
59.4.2.4^not you have, because - not ask you.
59.4.3.1^you ask and not receive, because wrongly you ask, that in the pleasures of you, you may spend it.
59.4.4.1^adulteresses!
59.4.4.2^not know you that the friendship with the world, hostility with god is?
59.4.4.3^whoever if therefore has chosen a friend to be of the world, an enemy - of god is appointed.
59.4.5.1^or think you that in vain the scripture says, with envy yearns the spirit that he has made to dwell in us?
59.4.6.1^greater however he gives grace.
59.4.6.2^therefore it says:
59.4.6.3^- god the proud opposes, to the humble however gives grace.
59.4.7.1^subject yourselves therefore - to god.
59.4.7.2^resist however the devil, and he will flee from you.
59.4.8.1^draw near - to god, and he will draw near to you.
59.4.8.2^cleanse your hands, you sinners, and have purified hearts, you double-minded.
59.4.9.1^be grieved, and mourn, and weep.
59.4.9.2^the laughter of you, to mourning let be turned, and the joy to gloom.
59.4.10.1^humble yourselves in the presence of the lord, and he will exalt you.
59.4.11.1^not speak against one another, brothers.
59.4.11.2^the one speaking against his brother or judging the brother of him, speaks against the law and judges the law.
59.4.11.3^if however the law you judge, not you are a doer of the law, but a judge.
59.4.12.1^one there is - lawgiver and judge, the one being able to save and to destroy.
59.4.12.2^you however, who are - judging the neighbor?
59.4.13.1^come now, those saying, today or tomorrow we will go into such - city, and will spend there a year, and will trade, and will make a profit,
59.4.14.1^who not know what is on the next day is.
59.4.14.2^what is the life of you?
59.4.14.3^a vapor just it is, - for a little while appearing, then also vanishing.
59.4.15.1^instead ought - to say you, if the lord should will, both we will live and we will do this or that.
59.4.16.1^now however you boast in the arrogance of you.
59.4.16.2^all boasting such evil is.
59.4.17.1^to him knowing therefore good to do, and not doing, sin to him it is.
59.5.1.1^come now, you rich, weep, wailing over the miseries upon you that are coming.
59.5.2.1^the riches of you have rotted, and the garments of you moth-eaten have become.
59.5.3.1^the gold of you and the silver have corroded, and the rust of them for a testimony against you will be, and will eat the flesh of you like fire.
59.5.3.2^you have treasured up in the last days.
59.5.4.1^behold, the wage of the workmen - having harvested the fields of you, - having been kept back by you, cries out, and the cries of those having harvested, into the ears of the lord of hosts have entered.
59.5.5.1^you lived in luxury upon the earth, and lived in self-indulgence.
59.5.5.2^you have fattened the hearts of you in the day of slaughter.
59.5.6.1^you have condemned and have put to death the righteous;
59.5.6.2^not does he resist you.
59.5.7.1^be patient therefore, brothers, until the coming of the lord.
59.5.7.2^behold, the farmer awaits the precious fruit of the earth, being patient for it until it receives the early and latter rains.
59.5.8.1^be patient also you;
59.5.8.2^strengthen the hearts of you, because the coming of the lord has drawn near.
59.5.9.1^not grumble brothers against one another, so that not you may be condemned.
59.5.9.2^behold, the judge before the doors is standing.
59.5.10.1^as an example take, brothers, - of suffering evils and - of patience, the prophets who spoke in the name of the lord.
59.5.11.1^behold, we count blessed those having persevered.
59.5.11.2^the perseverance of job you have heard of, and the outcome from the lord you have seen, that full of compassion is the lord, and is merciful.
59.5.12.1^before all things however, brothers of me, not swear, neither by - heaven, nor the earth, nor other any oath.
59.5.12.2^be however of you the yes, yes, and the no, no, so that not under judgment you might fall.
59.5.13.1^is suffering hardships anyone among you?
59.5.13.2^let him pray.
59.5.13.3^is cheerful anyone?
59.5.13.4^let him sing praises.
59.5.14.1^is sick anyone among you?
59.5.14.2^let him call near the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, having anointed him with oil in the name of the lord.
59.5.15.1^and the prayer - of faith will save the one ailing, and will raise up him the lord, and if sins he might be one having committed, it will be forgiven him.
59.5.16.1^confess therefore to one another the sins, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed.
59.5.16.2^much prevails the prayer of a righteous man being made effective.
59.5.17.1^elijah a man was of like nature to us, and with fervent prayer he prayed for it - not to rain, and not it did rain upon the earth years three and months six.
59.5.18.1^and again he prayed, and the heaven rain gave, and the earth produced the fruit of it.
59.5.19.1^brothers of me, if anyone among you might wander from the truth, and should bring back someone him,
59.5.20.1^let him know that the one having brought back a sinner from the error of the way of him will save the soul of him from death and will cover over a multitude of sins.
60.1.1.1^peter, an apostle of jesus christ, to the elect sojourners of the dispersion of pontus, galatia, cappadocia, asia, and bithynia,
60.1.2.1^according to the foreknowledge of god the father, by the sanctification of the spirit, unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ:
60.1.2.2^grace to you and peace may be multiplied.
60.1.3.1^blessed be the god and father of the lord of us jesus christ, the one according to the great of him mercy having begotten again us to a hope living, through the resurrection of jesus christ out from the dead,
60.1.4.1^to an inheritance imperishable and undefiled and unfading, being reserved in the heavens for you,
60.1.5.1^who by the power of god are being guarded through faith, for the salvation ready to be revealed in the time last,
60.1.6.1^in which you greatly rejoice, for a little while at present, if being necessary it is, having been put to grief by various trials,
60.1.7.1^so that the proven genuineness of your - faith, more precious than gold, - perishing, by fire though being refined, may be discovered to result in praise and glory and honor in the revelation of jesus christ,
60.1.8.1^whom not having seen you love, on whom now though not seeing believing now you exult with joy inexpressible and filled with glory,
60.1.9.1^receiving the outcome of the faith of you, the salvation of your souls.
60.1.10.1^concerning this salvation, sought out and searched out diligently the prophets, - of the toward you grace having prophesied,
60.1.11.1^inquiring into what or what manner of time was signifying the in them spirit of christ, testifying beforehand - unto christ s sufferings and the after these glories,
60.1.12.1^to whom it was revealed that not themselves, you however, they were serving in those things which now have been proclaimed to you by those having proclaimed the gospel to you by the spirit holy having been sent from heaven, into which desire angels to look.
60.1.13.1^therefore having girded up the loins of the mind of you, being sober-minded, fully set your hope upon the being brought to you grace in the revelation of jesus christ,
60.1.14.1^as children of obedience, not fashioning yourselves to the former in the ignorance of you desires.
60.1.15.1^but as the one having called you is holy, also yourselves holy in all your conduct be,
60.1.16.1^because it has been written holy you shall be, because i am holy
60.1.17.1^and if as father you call on the one impartially judging according to the of each work, in fear during the of the sojourn of you time conduct yourselves,
60.1.18.1^knowing that not by perishable things   by silver or by gold   you were redeemed from the futile of you manner of life handed down from your fathers,
60.1.19.1^but by the precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, of christ,
60.1.20.1^having been foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, having been revealed however in the last - times for the sake of you,
60.1.21.1^who by him believe in god, the one having raised up him out from the dead and glory him having given, so as for the faith of you, and hope, to be in god.
60.1.22.1^the souls of you having purified by - obedience to the truth unto brotherly love sincere, out of purity of heart, one another love fervently.
60.1.23.1^having been born again, not of seed perishable, but of imperishable, by the word living of god, and abiding,
60.1.24.1^because, all flesh is like grass, and all the glory of it like the flower of grass.
60.1.24.2^withers the grass, and the flower falls away,
60.1.25.1^- but the word of the lord abides to the age.
60.1.25.2^this now is the word - having been proclaimed to you.
60.2.1.1^having put aside therefore all malice, and all deceit, and hypocrisy, and envies, and all evil speakings,
60.2.2.1^like newborn babies, - reasonable pure milk crave, so that by it you may grow up in respect to salvation,
60.2.3.1^if indeed you have tasted that is good the lord.
60.2.4.1^to whom coming, a stone living, by men indeed rejected, in the sight of however god chosen and precious,
60.2.5.1^also you yourselves as stones living, are being built up as a house spiritual into a priesthood holy, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god through jesus christ.
60.2.6.1^therefore it is contained in scripture:
60.2.6.2^behold, i lay in zion a stone, cornerstone, a chosen precious;
60.2.6.3^and the one believing on him, no not shall be put to shame.
60.2.7.1^to you therefore is the preciousness, - believing;
60.2.7.2^to those disobeying, however, the stone which have rejected those building, this has become into the head of the corner,
60.2.8.1^and, a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense.
60.2.8.2^they stumble at, to the word being disobedient, to which also they were appointed.
60.2.9.1^you however are a race chosen, a royal priesthood, a nation holy, a people for his possession, so that the excellencies you may proclaim of the one out of darkness you having called, to the marvelous of him light,
60.2.10.1^who once were not a people, now however the people of god;
60.2.10.2^those not having received mercy, now however having received mercy.
60.2.11.1^beloved, i exhort you as aliens and sojourners, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against the soul,
60.2.12.1^the conduct of you among the gentiles keeping honorable, so that wherein which they speak against you as evildoers, through the good deeds having witnessed, they may glorify - god in the day of visitation.
60.2.13.1^be in subjection to every human institution for the sake of the lord, whether to the king as being supreme,
60.2.14.1^or to governors, as by him being sent for vengeance to evildoers, praise then to well-doers,
60.2.15.1^because this is the will - of god, doing good, to put to silence the - of foolish men ignorance,
60.2.16.1^as free, and not as a cover-up having for evil the freedom, but as of god servants.
60.2.17.1^everyone honor:
60.2.17.2^the brotherhood love, - god fear, the king honor.
60.2.18.1^- servants, be subject with all fear to masters, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the unreasonable.
60.2.19.1^this for is acceptable, if for sake of conscience toward god, endures anyone griefs, suffering unjustly.
60.2.20.1^what kind of for credit is it, if sinning and being struck you shall endure?
60.2.20.2^but if doing good and suffering you shall endure, this is commendable before god.
60.2.21.1^to this hereunto for you have been called, because also christ suffered for you, you leaving an example that you should follow after the steps of him:
60.2.22.1^who sin not committed, neither was found trickery in the mouth of him.
60.2.23.1^who being reviled, not reviled in return;
60.2.23.2^suffering not threatened;
60.2.23.3^he gave himself over however to him judging justly.
60.2.24.1^who the sins of us himself bore in the body of him on the tree, so that, - to sins having been dead, - to righteousness we might live.
60.2.24.2^by whose - wounds you have been healed.
60.2.25.1^you were for like sheep going astray, but you have returned now to the shepherd and overseer of the souls of you.
60.3.1.1^likewise - wives, be subject to the own husbands, so that, even if any are disobedient to the word, by the of the wives conduct, without word, they will be won over,
60.3.2.1^having witnessed the in respect pure conduct of you,
60.3.3.1^whose let it be not the external of braiding of hair and putting around of gold, or putting on of garments adorning,
60.3.4.1^but the hidden of the heart man, in the imperishable of the gentle and quiet spirit, which is before - god of great worth.
60.3.5.1^in this way for formerly also the holy women - hoping in god used to adorn themselves, being subject to the own husbands,
60.3.6.1^as sarah obeyed - abraham, lord him calling, of whom you have become children, doing good and not fearing not one consternation.
60.3.7.1^- husbands likewise, dwelling with them according to knowledge, as with a weaker vessel with the female, rendering honor, as also joint-heirs of the grace of life, so as for - not to be hindered the prayers of you.
60.3.8.1^- now the end:
60.3.8.2^all be single-minded, sympathetic, loving as brothers, tender-hearted, humble,
60.3.9.1^not repaying evil for evil or insult for insult;
60.3.9.2^on the contrary however, blessing, because to this you were called, so that blessing you should inherit.
60.3.10.1^the one for desiring life to love, and to see days good, let him keep the tongue from evil, and lips - not to speak deceit.
60.3.11.1^let him turn away also from evil, and let him do good.
60.3.11.2^let him seek peace and let him pursue it.
60.3.12.1^because the eyes of the lord are on the righteous, and the ears of him toward prayer of them.
60.3.12.2^the face however of the lord is against those doing evil.
60.3.13.1^and who is he who will harm you, if for that which is good, zealous you should be?
60.3.14.1^but if even you should suffer because of righteousness, you are blessed.
60.3.14.2^- and the threats of them not you should be afraid of, neither should you be troubled.
60.3.15.1^as lord however, - christ sanctify in the hearts of you, ready always for a defense to everyone - asking you an account concerning the in you hope;
60.3.16.1^yet with gentleness and fear, a conscience having good, so that in this they might speak against you, they shall be ashamed those reviling your - good in christ manner of life.
60.3.17.1^it is better for doing good if wills it the will - of god, to suffer, than doing evil,
60.3.18.1^because also christ once for sins suffered, the righteous for the unrighteous, so that you he might bring - to god, having been put to death indeed in the flesh, having been made alive however in the spirit,
60.3.19.1^in which also to the in prison spirits, having gone he preached,
60.3.20.1^having disobeyed at one time, when was waiting the - of god longsuffering in the days of noah, being prepared of the ark, in which a few   that is, eight souls   were saved through water,
60.3.21.1^which also you prefigures now saving baptism, not of flesh a putting away of the filth, but of a conscience good, the demand toward god, through the resurrection of jesus christ,
60.3.22.1^who is at the right hand - of god, having gone into heaven, having been subjected to him angels and authorities and powers.
60.4.1.1^christ therefore having suffered in the flesh, also you the same mind arm yourselves with, because the one having suffered in the flesh is done with sin,
60.4.2.1^so as - no longer to men s desires but to the will of god, the remaining in the flesh to live time.
60.4.3.1^is sufficient for the past time the desire of the gentiles to have carried out, having walked in sensuality, lusts, drunkenness, orgies, carousing, and abominable idolatries.
60.4.4.1^with respect to this they think it strange, not running with them of you into the same - of debauchery overflow, speaking evil of you,
60.4.5.1^who will give account to him who ready is to judge the living and the dead.
60.4.6.1^to this end indeed, even to the dead the gospel was proclaimed, so that they might be judged indeed according to men in the flesh;
60.4.6.2^they might live however according to god in the spirit.
60.4.7.1^of all now the end has drawn near.
60.4.7.2^be clear-minded therefore, and sober for the purpose of prayers,
60.4.8.1^above all things, - among yourselves love fervent having, because love covers over a multitude of sins,
60.4.9.1^hospitable to one another, without complaint,
60.4.10.1^each as has received a gift, to each other them serving, as good stewards of the manifold grace of god:
60.4.11.1^if anyone speaks, as oracles of god;
60.4.11.2^if anyone serves, as of strength which supplies - god, so that in all things may be glorified - god through jesus christ, to whom be the glory and the power to the ages of the ages.
60.4.11.3^amen.
60.4.12.1^beloved, not be surprised at the among you fire for a trial to you taking place, as if a strange thing to you were happening.
60.4.13.1^but as you have shared in the - of christ sufferings, rejoice, so that also in the revelation of the glory of him, you may rejoice exulting.
60.4.14.1^if you are insulted in the name of christ, you are blessed, because the - of glory and - - of god spirit upon you rests.
60.4.15.1^not for any of you let suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evildoer, or as a troublesome meddler;
60.4.16.1^if however as a christian, not let him be ashamed;
60.4.16.2^let him glorify however - god in the name this.
60.4.17.1^for it is the time for - to have begun the judgment from the house - of god;
60.4.17.2^if now first from us, what will be the outcome of those disobeying the - of god gospel?
60.4.18.1^and, if the righteous one with difficulty is saved, the ungodly and sinner where will appear?
60.4.19.1^therefore also, those suffering according to the will - of god, to the faithful creator let them commit the souls of them in well doing.
60.5.1.1^elders - among you, i exhort, - a fellow elder and witness of the - of christ sufferings, who am also of the being about to be revealed glory partaker:
60.5.2.1^shepherd the among you flock - of god, exercising oversight not under compulsion, but willingly, according to god;
60.5.2.2^and not for base gain, but eagerly;
60.5.3.1^not as exercising lordship over - those in your charge, but examples being to the flock.
60.5.4.1^and having been revealed the chief shepherd, you will receive the unfading - of glory crown.
60.5.5.1^likewise, younger ones, be subject to your elders.
60.5.5.2^all now one to another - humility gird on, because, - god the proud opposes, to the humble however he gives grace.
60.5.6.1^be humbled therefore under the mighty hand - of god, so that you he may exalt in due time,
60.5.7.1^all the anxiety of you having cast upon him, because with him there is care about you.
60.5.8.1^be sober-minded;
60.5.8.2^watch.
60.5.8.3^the adversary of you, the devil, as a lion roaring prowls about, seeking whom to devour,
60.5.9.1^whom you should resist, firm in the faith, knowing the same - sufferings - throughout the world in your brotherhood to be accomplished.
60.5.10.1^the now god of all grace, the one having called you to the eternal of him glory in christ, a little while of you having suffered, he himself will perfect, will confirm, will strengthen, and will establish you.
60.5.11.1^to him be the power to the ages.
60.5.11.2^amen.
60.5.12.1^through silvanus, to you the faithful brother as i regard him, through few words i have written, exhorting and testifying this to be the true grace - of god, in which you stand.
60.5.13.1^greets you she in babylon, elected with you, and mark, the son of me.
60.5.14.1^greet one another with a kiss of love.
60.5.14.2^peace be to you all who are in christ.
61.1.1.1^simon peter, a servant and apostle of jesus christ, to those equally precious with ours having obtained a faith, through the righteousness of the god of us and savior, jesus christ:
61.1.2.1^grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge - of god and of jesus the lord of us.
61.1.3.1^accordingly, all things to us the divine power of him - toward life and godliness has given, through the knowledge of the one having called us by his own glory and excellence,
61.1.4.1^through which the precious and magnificent to us promises he has given, so that through these you might become of the divine partakers nature, having escaped the in the world in desire, decay.
61.1.5.1^and very reason for this now, earnestness all having brought in, supplement into the faith of you - virtue, into and - virtue - knowledge,
61.1.6.1^into then - knowledge - self-control, into then - self-control - endurance, into then - endurance - godliness,
61.1.7.1^in then - godliness - brotherly affection, in then - brotherly affection - love.
61.1.8.1^these things for in you being and abounding, neither idle nor unfruitful make you, as to the of the lord of us jesus christ, knowledge.
61.1.9.1^in whomever for not are present these things, blind he is, being short sighted, forgetfulness having received of the purification the former of him sins.
61.1.10.1^therefore rather, brothers, be diligent, sure your - calling and election to make, these things for practicing never not shall you stumble at any time.
61.1.11.1^in this way for richly will be supplied to you the entrance into the eternal kingdom of the lord of us and savior, jesus christ.
61.1.12.1^therefore i will be ready always you to remind concerning these things, though knowing them and having been strengthened in the being present in you truth.
61.1.13.1^right now i esteem it, as long as i am in this - tabernacle, to stir up you by putting you in remembrance,
61.1.14.1^knowing that impending is the putting off of the tabernacle of me, as also the lord of us jesus christ has made clear to me.
61.1.15.1^i will be diligent now also at every time, to have for you after - my departure, - these things a lasting remembrance to make.
61.1.16.1^not for cleverly devised fables having followed out, we have made known to you the of the lord of us jesus christ power and coming, but eyewitnesses having been - of his majesty.
61.1.17.1^having received for from god the father honor and glory, a voice was brought to him, such as follows by the majestic glory:
61.1.17.2^the son of me, - beloved of me, this is, in whom i have found delight.
61.1.18.1^and this - voice we heard from heaven, having been brought with him, being in the holy mountain.
61.1.19.1^and we have more certain the prophetic word, to which well you do taking heed, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until this day shall have dawned and the morning star shall have arisen in the hearts of you,
61.1.20.1^this first knowing, that any prophecy of scripture of its own interpretation not is.
61.1.21.1^not for by the will of man was brought prophecy at any time, but by the spirit holy being carried, spoke from god men.
61.2.1.1^there were however also false prophets among the people, as also among you there will be false teachers, who will stealthily introduce heresies destructive, even the having bought them master denying, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.
61.2.2.1^and many will follow after their - sensuality, through whom the way of the truth will be maligned.
61.2.3.1^and through covetousness with fabricated words you they will exploit, for whom the judgment of long ago not is idle, and the destruction of them not slumbers.
61.2.4.1^if for - god the angels having sinned, not spared, but in chains of gloomy darkness having cast them down to tartarus, delivered them, for judgment being kept;
61.2.5.1^and the ancient world not he spared, but one of eight, noah of righteousness a herald preserved, the flood upon the world of the ungodly having brought in;
61.2.6.1^and the cities of sodom and gomorrah having reduced to ashes, to destruction he condemned them, an example of what is coming on the ungodly having set;
61.2.7.1^and righteous lot, being distressed by the of the lawless in sensuality conduct, he rescued
61.2.8.1^through seeing for and hearing that righteous man, dwelling among them day after day, in his soul righteous with their lawless deeds was tormented
61.2.9.1^then knows the lord the devout out of temptation to deliver;
61.2.9.2^the unrighteous then unto the day of judgment being punished to keep;
61.2.10.1^especially then those after the flesh in the passion of defilement walking and authority despising.
61.2.10.2^bold, self-willed, glorious ones not they tremble blaspheming,
61.2.11.1^whereas angels, in strength and power greater being, not do bring against them before the lord a reviling judgment.
61.2.12.1^these however, like irrational animals, having been born as creatures of instinct for capture and destruction, in what they are ignorant of, blaspheming, in the destruction of them also will be destroyed,
61.2.13.1^suffering wrong as the wage of unrighteousness;
61.2.13.2^as pleasure esteeming - in daytime carousal;
61.2.13.3^blots and blemishes, reveling in the deceptions of them, feasting with you;
61.2.14.1^eyes having full of adultery, and unceasing from sin, enticing souls unestablished;
61.2.14.2^a heart having been exercised in craving having   of a curse children!
61.2.15.1^having left the straight way, they have gone astray, having followed in the way - of balaam - son of bosor, who the wage of unrighteousness loved;
61.2.16.1^reproof however he had for his own transgression by a donkey mute;
61.2.16.2^in a man s voice having spoken, it restrained the of the prophet madness.
61.2.17.1^these are springs without water and mists by storm being driven, for whom - gloom - of darkness has been reserved.
61.2.18.1^arrogant for of vanity speaking words, they entice with the passions of the flesh to sensuality those barely escaping from those in error living,
61.2.19.1^freedom them promising, themselves slaves being - of corruption.
61.2.19.2^by what for anyone has been subdued, by that he is enslaved.
61.2.20.1^if for having escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the lord and savior jesus christ, in these now again having been entangled they are subdued, has become to them the last state worse than the first.
61.2.21.1^better for it would have been for them not to have known the way - of righteousness, than having known it, to have turned from the having been delivered to them holy commandment.
61.2.22.1^has happened to them the thing of the true proverb:
61.2.22.2^a dog having returned to its own vomit,  and, a sow having washed, to her rolling place in the mire.
61.3.1.1^this now, beloved, is the second to you i am writing letter, in which i am stirring up of you in putting you in remembrance - pure mind,
61.3.2.1^to remember the having been spoken beforehand words   by the holy prophets and of the - apostles through your   commandment of the lord and savior,
61.3.3.1^this first knowing, that will come in the last of the days with scoffing scoffers, according to - own evil desires of them following
61.3.4.1^and saying, where is the promise of the coming of him?
61.3.4.2^from the time that for the fathers fell asleep, all things as they were continue from the beginning of creation.
61.3.5.1^it is concealed from indeed them this willingly, that heavens existed long ago, and the earth out of water and through water having been composed by the - of god word,
61.3.6.1^through which the at that time world, with water having been deluged, perished.
61.3.7.1^- but now the heavens and the earth, by the same word having been stored up exist, for fire being kept unto the day of judgment and destruction - of ungodly men.
61.3.8.1^this one however thing not let be hidden from you, beloved, that one day with the lord is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like day one.
61.3.9.1^not does delay the lord the promise, as some slowness esteem, but is patient toward you, not willing for any to perish, but all to repentance to come.
61.3.10.1^will come however the day of the lord like a thief, in which the heavens with a roar will pass away, elements then burning with heat will be dissolved, and the earth and the in it works not will be found.
61.3.11.1^these things in this way all being dissolved, what kind ought to be you?
61.3.11.2^in holy conduct and godliness,
61.3.12.1^expecting and hastening the coming of the - of god day, by reason of which the heavens being set on fire will be dissolved, and the elements burning with heat are melting.
61.3.13.1^new however heavens, and earth a new, according to the promise of him, we are awaiting, in which righteousness dwells.
61.3.14.1^therefore, beloved, these things expecting, be diligent without spot and without blemish by him to be found, in peace.
61.3.15.1^and the of the lord of us patience as salvation esteem, just as also - beloved of us brother paul, according to the having been given to him wisdom, wrote to you,
61.3.16.1^as also in all the letters, speaking in them concerning these things, among which are difficult to be understood some things, which the ignorant and unestablished distort, as also the other scriptures, to the own of them destruction.
61.3.17.1^you therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, beware, that not by the of the lawless error having been led away, you should fall from the own steadfastness.
61.3.18.1^grow however in grace, and in knowledge of the lord of us and savior jesus christ.
61.3.18.2^to him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity.
62.1.1.1^that which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with the eyes of us, that which we have gazed upon and the hands of us have handled, concerning the word - of life
62.1.2.1^and the life was made manifest, and we have seen and bear witness, and we proclaim to you the life - eternal which was with the father and was revealed to us
62.1.3.1^that which we have seen and have heard, we proclaim also to you, so that also you fellowship may have with us.
62.1.3.2^indeed the fellowship now - of us is with the father, and with the son of him, jesus christ.
62.1.4.1^and these things write we so that the joy of us might be complete.
62.1.5.1^and is this the message that we have heard from him, and we preach to you, that - god light is, and darkness in him, not is none.
62.1.6.1^if we should say that fellowship we have with him, and yet in the darkness should walk, we lie and not do practice the truth.
62.1.7.1^if in the light we should walk as he is in the light, fellowship we have with one another, and the blood of jesus, the son of him, cleanses us from all sin.
62.1.8.1^if we should say that sin not we have, ourselves we deceive, and the truth not is in us.
62.1.9.1^if we should confess the sins of us, faithful he is and just, that he may forgive us our sins, and might cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
62.1.10.1^if we should say that not we have sinned, a liar we make him, and the word of him not is in us.
62.2.1.1^little children of me, these things i am writing to you so that not you might sin.
62.2.1.2^and if anyone should sin, an advocate we have with the father, jesus christ the righteous one.
62.2.2.1^and he the propitiation is for the sins of us;
62.2.2.2^not for the of ours and only, but also for all the world.
62.2.3.1^and by this we know that we have come to know him, if the commandments of him we should keep.
62.2.4.1^the one saying -, i have known him, and the commandments of him not keeping, a liar he is, and in him the truth not is.
62.2.5.1^whoever however - may keep his - word, truly in him the love - of god has been perfected.
62.2.5.2^by this we know that in him we are:
62.2.6.1^the one claiming in him to abide, ought just as that walk also he in the same way walked.
62.2.7.1^beloved, not a commandment new i am writing to you, but a commandment old, which you have had from the beginning.
62.2.7.2^the commandment - old is the word that you have heard.
62.2.8.1^again, a commandment new i am writing to you, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the light - true already shines.
62.2.9.1^the one claiming in the light to be and the brother of him hating, in the darkness is even until now.
62.2.10.1^the one loving the brother of him, in the light abides, and cause for stumbling in him not there is.
62.2.11.1^the one however hating the brother of him, in the darkness is, and in the darkness walks;
62.2.11.2^and not does he know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded the eyes of him.
62.2.12.1^i am writing to you, little children, because have been forgiven your - sins for the sake of the name of him.
62.2.13.1^i am writing to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning.
62.2.13.2^i am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one.
62.2.14.1^i have written to you, little children, because you know the father.
62.2.14.2^i have written to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning.
62.2.14.3^i have written to you, young men, because strong you are, and the word - of god in you abides, and you have overcome the evil one.
62.2.15.1^not love the world nor the things in the world.
62.2.15.2^if anyone should love the world, not is the love of the father in him,
62.2.16.1^because all that is in the world, the desire of the flesh, and the desire of the eyes, and the vaunting of life, not is from the father, but from the world is.
62.2.17.1^and the world is passing away, and the desire of it;
62.2.17.2^the one however doing the will - of god abides to the age.
62.2.18.1^little children, the last hour it is, and as you have heard that antichrist is coming, even now antichrists many have arisen, whereby we know that the last hour it is.
62.2.19.1^from among us they went out, but not they were of us;
62.2.19.2^if for of us they had been, they would have remained - with us.
62.2.19.3^but it is so that it might be made manifest that not they are all of us.
62.2.20.1^and you the anointing have from the holy one, and know you all.
62.2.21.1^not i have written to you because not you know the truth, but because you know it, and because any lie, of the truth not is.
62.2.22.1^who is the liar, if not the one denying that jesus not is the christ?
62.2.22.2^this is the antichrist, the one denying the father and the son.
62.2.23.1^everyone - denying the son, neither the father has he.
62.2.23.2^the one confessing the son, also the father has.
62.2.24.1^you, what you have heard from the beginning, in you let it abide.
62.2.24.2^if in you should abide what from the beginning you have heard, also you in the son and in the father will abide.
62.2.25.1^and this is the promise that he promised us:
62.2.25.2^- life - eternal.
62.2.26.1^these things i have written to you concerning those leading astray you.
62.2.27.1^and you, the anointing that you received from him, abides in you, and not need you have that anyone should teach you.
62.2.27.2^but just as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things, and true is, and not is a lie;
62.2.27.3^and just as it has taught you, you shall abide in him.
62.2.28.1^and now, little children, abide in him, so that when he appears we might have boldness and not be ashamed before him at the coming of him.
62.2.29.1^if you know that righteous he is, you know that also everyone - practicing - righteousness, of him has been begotten.
62.3.1.1^behold what love has given to us the father, that children of god we should be called   and we are!
62.3.1.2^because of this, the world not knows us, because not it knew him.
62.3.2.1^beloved, now children of god are we, and not yet has been revealed what we will be.
62.3.2.2^we know that when he appears, like him we will be, for we will see him as he is.
62.3.3.1^and everyone - having the hope this in him, purifies himself, just as he pure is.
62.3.4.1^everyone - committing - sin, also - lawlessness commits;
62.3.4.2^and - sin is - lawlessness.
62.3.5.1^and you know that he appeared so that - sins he might take away;
62.3.5.2^and sin in him not there is.
62.3.6.1^anyone - in him abiding, not sins;
62.3.6.2^anyone - sinning, not has seen him, nor has he known him.
62.3.7.1^little children, no one let lead astray you;
62.3.7.2^the one practicing - righteousness, righteous is, just as he righteous is.
62.3.8.1^the one practicing - sin, of the devil is, because from the beginning the devil has been sinning.
62.3.8.2^for this reason was revealed the son - of god, so that he might destroy the works of the devil.
62.3.9.1^anyone - having been born of - god, sin not practices, because seed of him in him abides, and not he is able to continue sinning, because of - god he has been born.
62.3.10.1^through this manifest are the children - of god and the children of the devil:
62.3.10.2^anyone - not practicing righteousness not is of - god, and also the one not loving the brother of him.
62.3.11.1^for this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another,
62.3.12.1^not as cain , who of the evil one was and slew the brother of him.
62.3.12.2^and because of what he slayed him?
62.3.12.3^because the works of him evil were, those however of the brother of him, righteous.
62.3.13.1^and not be surprised, brothers, if hates you the world.
62.3.14.1^we know that we have passed from - death to - life, because we love our brothers.
62.3.14.2^the one not loving abides in - death.
62.3.15.1^everyone - hating the brother of him a murderer is;
62.3.15.2^and you know that any murderer, not has life eternal in him abiding.
62.3.16.1^by this we have known - love, because he for us the life of him laid down;
62.3.16.2^and we ought for our brothers, our lives to lay down.
62.3.17.1^whoever now - might have the goods of the world, and might see the brother of him need having, and might close up the heart of him from him, how the love - of god abides in him?
62.3.18.1^little children, not we should love in word, nor in tongue, but in action and in truth.
62.3.19.1^and by this we will know that of the truth we are, and before him we will assure the heart of us,
62.3.20.1^that if should condemn us our - heart, that greater than is - god the heart of us, and he knows all things.
62.3.21.1^beloved, if the heart of us not should condemn us, confidence we have toward - god,
62.3.22.1^and whatever if we might ask, we receive from him, because the commandments of him we keep, and the things pleasing before him we do.
62.3.23.1^and this is the commandment of him, that we should believe in the name the son of him, jesus christ, and we should love one another, just as he gave the commandment to us.
62.3.24.1^and the one keeping the commandments of him, in him abides, and he in him.
62.3.24.2^and by this we know that he abides in us, by the spirit whom to us he has given.
62.4.1.1^beloved, not every spirit believe, but test the spirits, whether of - god they are, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
62.4.2.1^by this you know the spirit - of god:
62.4.2.2^every spirit that confesses jesus christ in the flesh having come, of - god is;
62.4.3.1^and any spirit that not confesses - jesus, from - god not is.
62.4.3.2^and this is that of the antichrist, which you heard that is coming, and now in the world is already.
62.4.4.1^you from - god are, little children, and have overcome them, because greater is the one in you than the one in the world.
62.4.5.1^they of the world are;
62.4.5.2^because of this from out of the world they speak, and the world them listens to.
62.4.6.1^we of - god are.
62.4.6.2^the one knowing - god listens to us.
62.4.6.3^he who not is from - god, not listens to us.
62.4.6.4^by this we know the spirit - of truth and the spirit - of falsehood.
62.4.7.1^beloved, we should love one another, because - love from - god is;
62.4.7.2^and everyone - loving, from - god has been born, and knows - god.
62.4.8.1^the one not loving, not has known - god, because - god love is.
62.4.9.1^in this has been revealed the love - of god among us, that the son of him, the one and only, has sent - god into the world, so that we might live through him.
62.4.10.1^in this is - love, not that we loved - god, but that he loved us and sent the son of him as a propitiation for the sins of us.
62.4.11.1^beloved, if so - god loved us, also we ought one another to love.
62.4.12.1^god no one at any time has seen;
62.4.12.2^if we should love one another, - god in us abides and the love of him in us having been perfected is.
62.4.13.1^by this we know that in him we abide, and he in us, because from out the spirit of him he has given to us.
62.4.14.1^and we have seen and testify that the father has sent the son as savior of the world.
62.4.15.1^whoever if shall confess that jesus is the son - of god, - god in him abides, and he in - god.
62.4.16.1^and we have come to know and have come to believe the love that has - god as to us.
62.4.16.2^- god love is, and the one abiding in - love, in - god abides, and - god in him abides.
62.4.17.1^in this has been perfected - love with us, so that confidence we may have in the day - of judgment, that just as he is, also we are in the world this.
62.4.18.1^fear no there is in - love, but - perfect love out casts - fear, because the fear punishment has;
62.4.18.2^the one now fearing, not has been perfected in - love.
62.4.19.1^we love because he first loved us.
62.4.20.1^if anyone should say -, i love - god, and the brother of him should hate, a liar he is.
62.4.20.2^the one for not loving the brother of him, whom he has seen, - god, whom not he has seen, not is he able to love.
62.4.21.1^and this the commandment we have from him, that the one loving - god should love also the brother of him.
62.5.1.1^everyone - believing that jesus is the christ, of - god has been born, and everyone - loving the one having begotten him, loves also the one having been begotten from him.
62.5.2.1^by this we know that we love the children - of god, when - god we love and the commandments of him keep.
62.5.3.1^this for is the love - of god, that the commandments of him we should keep;
62.5.3.2^and the commandments of him burdensome not are.
62.5.4.1^for everyone - having been born of - god overcomes the world;
62.5.4.2^and this is the victory - having overcome the world:
62.5.4.3^the faith of us.
62.5.5.1^who now is the one overcoming the world, if not the one believing that jesus is the son - of god?
62.5.6.1^this is the one having come by water and blood, jesus christ;
62.5.6.2^not by - water only, but by - water and by - blood.
62.5.6.3^and the spirit is the one testifying, because the spirit is the truth.
62.5.7.1^for three there are - bearing testimony:
62.5.8.1^the spirit and the water and the blood   and these three in - one are.
62.5.9.1^if the testimony - of men we receive, the testimony - of god greater is.
62.5.9.2^for this is the testimony - of god that he has testified concerning the son of him.
62.5.10.1^the one believing in the son - of god has the testimony in himself.
62.5.10.2^the one not believing - god, a liar has made him, because not he has believed in the testimony that has testified - god concerning the son him.
62.5.11.1^and this is the testimony, that life eternal has given to us, - god and this the life in the son his is.
62.5.12.1^the one having the son has - life;
62.5.12.2^the one not having the son - of god, - life not has.
62.5.13.1^these things have i written to you so that you may know that life you have eternal, to those believing in the name of the son - of god.
62.5.14.1^and this is the confidence that we have toward him, that if anything we might ask according to the will of him, he hears us.
62.5.15.1^and if we know that he hears us, whatever if we might ask, we know that we have the requests that we have asked from him.
62.5.16.1^if anyone should see the brother of him sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and he will give him life, to those sinning not unto death.
62.5.16.2^there is a sin unto death;
62.5.16.3^not concerning that do i say that he should implore.
62.5.17.1^all unrighteousness sin is, and there is sin not unto death.
62.5.18.1^we know that everyone - having been born of - god not continues to sin, but the one having been begotten of - god protects him, and the evil one not does touch him.
62.5.19.1^we know that of - god we are, and the world whole, in the evil one lies.
62.5.20.1^we know now that the son - of god is come, and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true;
62.5.20.2^and we are in him who is true, in the son of him, jesus christ.
62.5.20.3^he is the true god and life eternal.
62.5.21.1^little children, keep yourselves from - idols.
63.1.1.1^the elder, to the elect lady and the children of her, whom i love in truth, and not i only, but also all those having known the truth
63.1.2.1^because of the truth - abiding in us and with us that will be to the age:
63.1.3.1^will be with us grace, mercy, and peace from god the father and from jesus christ, the son of the father, in truth and love.
63.1.4.1^i rejoiced exceedingly that i have found some of the children of you walking in truth, just as commandment we received from the father.
63.1.5.1^and now i implore you, lady, not as a commandment i am writing to you new, but that which we have had from the beginning, that we should love one another.
63.1.6.1^and this is - love, that we should walk according to the commandments of him.
63.1.6.2^this the commandment is just as you have heard from the beginning, so that in it you should walk.
63.1.7.1^for many deceivers have entered into the world, those not confessing jesus christ coming in flesh.
63.1.7.2^this is the deceiver and the antichrist.
63.1.8.1^watch yourselves, so that not you should lose what things we have worked for, but a reward full you may receive.
63.1.9.1^anyone - going on ahead and not abiding in the teaching - of christ, god not has.
63.1.9.2^the one abiding in the teaching, this one both the father and the son has.
63.1.10.1^if anyone comes to you and this - teaching not does bring, not receive him into the house, and to rejoice him not tell;
63.1.11.1^the one telling for him to rejoice partakes in the works of him - evil.
63.1.12.1^many things having to you to write, not i purposed with paper and ink;
63.1.12.2^but i hope to come to you, and mouth to mouth to speak, so that the joy of us may be.
63.1.12.3^having been completed
63.1.13.1^greet you, the children of the sister of you - elect.
64.1.1.1^the elder, to gaius the beloved, whom i love in truth.
64.1.2.1^beloved, concerning all things i pray you to prosper and to be in good health, just as prospers your - soul.
64.1.3.1^i rejoiced for exceedingly coming of the brothers and bearing witness of your - truth, just as you in truth are walking.
64.1.4.1^greater than these things not i have joy, that i should hear of - my children in the truth walking.
64.1.5.1^beloved, faithfully you are doing whatever if you might have done toward the brothers, and they are strangers,
64.1.6.1^who testified of your - love before the church, whom well you will do, having set forward worthily - of god.
64.1.7.1^on behalf for of the name they went forth, nothing accepting from the gentiles.
64.1.8.1^we therefore ought to receive - such men, so that fellow workers we may be in the truth.
64.1.9.1^i have written something to the church;
64.1.9.2^but the one loving to be first among them, diotrephes, not welcomes us.
64.1.10.1^because of this, if i might come, i will bring to remembrance of him the works which he is doing, with words evil prating against us;
64.1.10.2^and not being satisfied with these, neither himself he receives the brothers, and those purposing, he forbids, and from the church he casts them out.
64.1.11.1^beloved, not do imitate what is evil, but what is good.
64.1.11.2^the one doing good, of - god is;
64.1.11.3^the one doing evil, not has seen - god.
64.1.12.1^to demetrius witness has been given by all, and by itself the truth;
64.1.12.2^and we also bear witness, and you know that the testimony of us true is.
64.1.13.1^many things i had to write to you, but not i desire with ink and pen to you to write.
64.1.14.1^i hope however soon, you to see, and mouth to mouth we will speak.
64.1.15.1^peace to you.
64.1.15.2^greet you, the friends.
64.1.15.3^greet the friends by name.
65.1.1.1^jude, of jesus christ servant, brother then of james, to those in god the father having been loved and in jesus christ having been kept called.
65.1.2.1^mercy to you and peace and love be multiplied.
65.1.3.1^beloved, all diligence using to write to you concerning - common of us salvation, necessity i had to write to you, exhorting you to contend earnestly for the once for all having been delivered to the saints faith.
65.1.4.1^came in stealthily for certain men, those long ago having been designated unto this - condemnation, ungodly ones, the of the god of us grace changing into sensuality, and the only master and lord of us jesus christ denying.
65.1.5.1^to remind now you i want, having known you at one time all this, that jesus a people out of the land of egypt having saved, - afterward those not having believed, he destroyed.
65.1.6.1^the angels both - not having kept own their domain, but having left the own dwelling, unto the judgment of the great day, in chains eternal under darkness he keeps,
65.1.7.1^just as sodom and gomorrah and the around them cities, - in like manner with them having indulged in sexual immorality and having gone after flesh strange, are set forth as an example of fire eternal the penalty undergoing.
65.1.8.1^likewise yet also these dreaming ones, the flesh indeed defile, authority then set aside, glorious ones and blaspheme.
65.1.9.1^- but michael the archangel, when with the devil disputing, he was reasoning about - moses  body, not did dare a judgment to bring against him blasphemous, but said, rebuke you, the lord.
65.1.10.1^these however, whatever things indeed not they have seen they speak evil of;
65.1.10.2^whatever things then naturally, as the irrational animals, they understand, in these things they corrupt themselves.
65.1.11.1^woe to them, because in the way - of cain they went, and to the error - of balaam for reward they rushed, and in the rebellion - of korah they perished.
65.1.12.1^these are the ones in the love feasts of you, hidden reefs, feasting together with you fearlessly, themselves shepherding;
65.1.12.2^clouds without water, by winds being carried about;
65.1.12.3^trees autumnal without fruit, twice having died, having been uprooted;
65.1.13.1^waves wild of the sea, foaming out - of their shame;
65.1.13.2^stars wandering, to whom the gloom - of darkness to the age has been reserved.
65.1.14.1^prophesied then also as to these the seventh from adam, enoch, saying:
65.1.14.2^behold, has come the lord amidst holy ones myriads of his,
65.1.15.1^to execute judgment against all, and to convict every soul concerning all the works of ungodliness of them which they have done in an ungodly way, and concerning all the harsh things that have spoken against him sinners ungodly.
65.1.16.1^these are grumblers, discontented, after the lusts own following;
65.1.16.2^and the mouth of them speaks great swelling words, flattering faces profit for the sake of.
65.1.17.1^you however, beloved, remember the words - having been spoken beforehand by the apostles of the lord of us jesus christ,
65.1.18.1^that they were saying to you, in the last time there will be scoffers, after - their own passions following, - of ungodlinesses.
65.1.19.1^these are those causing divisions, worldly-minded, the spirit not having.
65.1.20.1^you however, beloved, building up yourselves, in the most holy of you faith in the spirit holy praying,
65.1.21.1^yourselves in the love of god keep, awaiting the mercy of the lord of us jesus christ, unto life eternal.
65.1.22.1^and those who indeed have mercy on, are doubting;
65.1.23.1^others also save, out of the fire snatching;
65.1.23.2^to others then show mercy with fear, hating even the by the flesh having been stained clothing.
65.1.24.1^to him now being able to keep you from stumbling and to present you in the presence of the glory of him, blameless with exultation
65.1.25.1^to the only god savior of us, through jesus christ the lord of us, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all - time and now, and to all the ages.
65.1.25.2^amen.
66.1.1.1^the revelation of jesus christ, which gave him - god, to show to the bond-servants of him what things it behooves to take place in quickness.
66.1.1.2^and he signified it, having sent through the angel of him, to the servant of him, john,
66.1.2.1^who testified to the word - of god and to the testimony of jesus christ, as much as he saw.
66.1.3.1^blessed is the one reading, and those hearing the words of the prophecy, and keeping the things in it having been written;
66.1.3.2^- for the time is near.
66.1.4.1^john, to the seven churches - in - asia:
66.1.4.2^grace to you and peace from him being and who was and who is coming, and from the seven spirits - before the throne of him,
66.1.5.1^and from jesus christ, the witness - faithful, the firstborn of the dead and the ruler of the kings of the earth.
66.1.5.2^to the one loving us and releasing us from the sins of us through the blood of him
66.1.6.1^and he has made us a kingdom, priests to the god and father of him   to him be the glory, and the dominion to the ages of the ages.
66.1.6.2^amen.
66.1.7.1^behold, he is coming with the clouds, and will see him every eye, and those who him pierced, and will wail because of him all the tribes of the earth.
66.1.7.2^yes!
66.1.7.3^amen!
66.1.8.1^i am the alpha and the omega,  says lord - god, the one being, and who was, and who is coming, the almighty.
66.1.9.1^i john, the brother of you, and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in jesus, was in the island - called patmos, on account of the word - of god and the testimony of jesus.
66.1.10.1^i was in the spirit on the lord s day, and i heard behind me a voice loud, like that of a trumpet,
66.1.11.1^saying, what you see, write in a book, and send to the seven churches, to ephesus, and to smyrna, and to pergamum, and to thyatira, and to sardis, and to philadelphia, and to laodicea.
66.1.12.1^and i turned to see the voice that was speaking with me.
66.1.12.2^and having turned, i saw seven lampstands golden,
66.1.13.1^and in the midst of the lampstands, one like the son of man, having been clothed to the feet, and having been girded about at the breasts with a sash golden.
66.1.14.1^- and the head of him and the hairs are white, as if wool, white as snow;
66.1.14.2^and the eyes of him are like a flame of fire;
66.1.15.1^and the feet of him are like fine bronze, as in a furnace having been refined;
66.1.15.2^and the voice of him is like the voice of waters many;
66.1.16.1^and he is holding in the right hand of him stars seven, and out of the mouth of him a sword two-edged sharp is going forth;
66.1.16.2^and the face of him is like the sun shining in the full strength of it.
66.1.17.1^and when i saw him, i fell at the feet of him as though dead.
66.1.17.2^and he placed the right hand of him upon me, saying, not fear.
66.1.17.3^i am the first and the last,
66.1.18.1^and the living one;
66.1.18.2^and i was dead, and behold living i am to the ages of the ages, and i have the keys of death and of hades.
66.1.19.1^write therefore the things that you have seen, and the things that are, and the things that are about to take place after these,
66.1.20.1^the mystery of the seven stars, which you saw on the right hand of me, and the seven lampstands - golden:
66.1.20.2^the seven stars the angels of the seven churches are, and the lampstands - seven the seven churches are.
66.2.1.1^to the messenger of the in ephesus church write:
66.2.1.2^these things says the one holding the seven stars in the right hand of him, - walking in the midst of the seven lampstands - golden.

66.4.2.1^immediately i was in the spirit, and behold, a throne was set in - heaven, and upon the throne one sitting,
66.4.3.1^and the one sitting was like in appearance stone, jasper and sardius.
66.4.3.2^and a rainbow was around the throne, like in appearance an emerald.
66.4.4.1^and around the throne, thrones were twenty four;
66.4.4.2^and on the thrones twenty four elders sitting, having been clothed in garments white;
66.4.4.3^and on the heads of them, crowns golden.
66.4.5.1^and out of the throne come flashes of lightning, and voices, and thunderings.
66.4.5.2^and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits - of god.
66.4.6.1^and before the throne was something like a sea of glass, like crystal.
66.4.6.2^and in the midst of the throne and around the throne were four living creatures, being full of eyes in front and behind.
66.4.7.1^and the living creature - first was like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living creature having the face as of a man, and the fourth living creature like an eagle flying.
66.4.8.1^and the four living creatures, one for one of them had respectively wings six, all around and within full of eyes;
66.4.8.2^and rest not they have day and night, saying:
66.4.8.3^holy, holy, holy, lord - god - almighty, the one having been, and the one being, and the one coming.

66.4.11.2^for you created - all things, and because of the will of you they existed, and were created.
66.5.1.1^and i saw on the right hand of the one sitting upon the throne a scroll, having been written inside and on the back, having been sealed with seals seven.
66.5.2.1^and i saw an angel strong, proclaiming in a voice loud, who is worthy to open the scroll, and to break the seals of it?
66.5.3.1^and no one was able in - heaven, nor upon the earth, nor under the earth, to open the scroll, nor to see it.
66.5.4.1^and i was weeping loudly, because no one worthy was found to open the scroll, nor to see it.
66.5.5.1^and one of the elders says to me, not do weep.
66.5.5.2^behold, has overcome the lion - of the tribe of judah, the root of david, to open the scroll and the seven seals of it.
66.5.6.1^and i saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a lamb standing as having been slain, having horns seven and eyes seven, which are the seven spirits - of god, having been sent out into all the earth.
66.5.7.1^and he came and took it out of the right hand of the one sitting on the throne.
66.5.8.1^and when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty four elders fell down before the lamb, having each a harp and bowls golden being full of incenses, which are the prayers of the saints.
66.5.9.1^and they are singing a song new, saying, worthy are you to take the scroll, and to open the seals of it, because you were slain, and you purchased - to god by the blood of you, out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation,
66.5.10.1^and you have made them to the god of us, a kingdom and priests;
66.5.10.2^and they will reign upon the earth.
66.5.11.1^and i looked, and i heard the voice of angels many around the throne, and of the living creatures, and of the elders;
66.5.11.2^and was the number of them myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands,
66.5.12.1^saying in a voice loud:
66.5.12.2^worthy is the lamb - having been slain, to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing!
66.5.13.1^and every creature which is in - heaven, and upon the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea and - in them everything, i heard saying:
66.5.13.2^to the one sitting on the throne, and to the lamb, - blessing and - honor and - glory and - might to the ages of the ages.
66.5.14.1^and the four living creatures kept saying, amen.
66.5.14.2^and the elders fell down and worshiped.
66.6.1.1^and i watched when opened the lamb one of the seven seals, and i heard one of the four living creatures saying, like a voice of thunder, come!
66.6.2.1^and i looked, and behold, a horse white, and the one sitting on it having a bow;
66.6.2.2^and was given to him a crown, and he went forth overcoming, and that he might conquer.
66.6.3.1^and when he opened the seal - second, i heard the second living creature saying, come!
66.6.4.1^and went forth another horse bright red;
66.6.4.2^and to the one sitting on it was granted to him to take the peace from the earth, and that one another they will slay;
66.6.4.3^and was given to him a sword great.
66.6.5.1^and when he opened the seal - third, i heard the third living creature saying, come!
66.6.5.2^and i looked, and behold, a horse black, and the one sitting on it having a pair of scales in the hand of him.
66.6.6.1^and i heard something like a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying, a choenix of wheat for a denarius, and three choenixes of barley for a denarius;
66.6.6.2^and the oil and the wine not you should injure.
66.6.7.1^and when he opened the seal - fourth, i heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, come!
66.6.8.1^and i looked, and behold, a horse pale, and the one sitting on it, the name of him was - death, and - hades was following with him;
66.6.8.2^and was given to them authority over the fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, and with famine, and with plague, and by the beasts of the earth.
66.6.9.1^and when he opened the fifth seal, i saw under the altar the souls of those having been slain because of the word - of god, and because of the testimony which they had upheld.
66.6.10.1^and they were crying in a voice loud, saying, until when, o lord, - holy and true, not do you judge, and avenge the blood of us from those dwelling upon the earth?
66.6.11.1^and were given to them each robes white, and it was said to them that they shall rest yet a time little, until would be fulfilled also the fellow servants of them, and the brothers of them, those being about to be killed as also had been they.
66.6.12.1^and i saw when he opened the seal - sixth, and an earthquake great there was, and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon whole became like blood,
66.6.13.1^and the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree casts the unripe figs of it, by a wind great being shaken.
66.6.14.1^and - heaven departed like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island out of the places of them were moved.
66.6.15.1^and the kings of the earth, and the great ones, and the commanders, and the rich, and the powerful, and every slave and free, hid themselves in the caves, and among the rocks of the mountains.
66.6.16.1^and they say to the mountains and to the rocks, fall on us and hide us from the face of the one sitting on the throne, and from the wrath of the lamb,
66.6.17.1^because has come the day - great of the wrath of them, and who is able to stand?
66.7.1.1^after these things i saw four angels standing upon the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, so that no would blow wind on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.
66.7.2.1^and i saw another angel, having ascended from the rising of the sun, having the seal of god the living.
66.7.2.2^and he cried in a voice loud to the four angels to whom it had been given to them to harm the earth and the sea,
66.7.3.1^saying, not harm the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, until we shall have sealed the servants of the god of us, on the foreheads of them.
66.7.4.1^and i heard the number of those having been sealed, one hundred forty four thousand, having been sealed out of every tribe of the sons of israel:
66.7.5.1^out of the tribe of judah twelve thousand having been sealed, out of the tribe of reuben twelve thousand, out of the tribe of gad twelve thousand,
66.7.6.1^out of the tribe of asher twelve thousand, out of the tribe of naphtali twelve thousand, out of the tribe of manasseh twelve thousand,
66.7.7.1^out of the tribe of simeon twelve thousand, out of the tribe of levi twelve thousand, out of the tribe of isaachar twelve thousand,
66.7.8.1^out of the tribe of zebulun twelve thousand, out of the tribe of joseph twelve thousand, out of the tribe of benjamin twelve thousand having been sealed.
66.7.9.1^after these things i looked, and behold, a multitude great, which to number it no one was able, out of every nation, and tribes, and peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne and before the lamb, having been clothed with robes white, and palm branches in the hands of them.
66.7.10.1^and they were crying out in a voice loud, saying:
66.7.10.2^- salvation to the god of us, the one sitting on the throne, and to the lamb!
66.7.11.1^and all the angels stood around the throne, and the elders, and the four living creatures, and they fell before the throne upon the faces of them, and worshiped - god,
66.7.12.1^saying, amen!
66.7.12.2^- blessing, and - glory, and - wisdom, and - thanksgiving, and - honor, and - power, and - strength, to the god of us, to the ages of the ages!
66.7.12.3^amen.
66.7.13.1^and answered one of the elders, saying to me, these - having been clothed with the robes - white, who are they, and from where have they come?
66.7.14.1^and i said to him, lord of me, you know.
66.7.14.2^and he said to me, these are the ones coming out of the tribulation - great, and they have washed the robes of them and made white them in the blood of the lamb.
66.7.15.1^because of this, they are before the throne - of god, and serve him day and night in the temple of him;
66.7.15.2^and the one sitting on the throne will tabernacle over them.
66.7.16.1^not they will hunger any more, neither will they thirst anymore, nor at all shall fall upon them the sun, nor any scorching heat;
66.7.17.1^because the lamb - in the center of the throne will shepherd them, and he will lead them to living fountains of waters, and will wipe away - god every tear from the eyes of them.
66.8.1.1^and when he opened the seal - seventh, there was silence in - heaven for about half an hour.
66.8.2.1^and i saw the seven angels who before - god stand, and were given to them seven trumpets.
66.8.3.1^and another angel came and stood at the altar, having a censer golden;
66.8.3.2^and was given to him incense much, that he will offer it with the prayers of the saints all upon the altar - golden - before the throne.
66.8.4.1^and went up the smoke of the incense with the prayers of the saints out of the hand of the angel, before - god.
66.8.5.1^and took the angel the censer, and filled it from the fire of the altar, and cast it to the earth;
66.8.5.2^and there were thunders, and rumblings, and flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.
66.8.6.1^and the seven angels - having the seven trumpets prepared themselves that they might sound the trumpets.
66.8.7.1^and the first sounded his trumpet, and there was hail, and fire having been mixed with blood, and it was cast upon the earth.
66.8.7.2^and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the grass green was burned up.
66.8.8.1^and the second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a mountain great, with fire burning, was cast into the sea.
66.8.8.2^and became a third of the sea blood,
66.8.9.1^and died a third of the creatures - in the sea - having life, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
66.8.10.1^and the third angel sounded his trumpet, and fell out of - heaven a star great, burning like a torch.
66.8.10.2^and it fell upon a third of the rivers, and upon the springs of waters.
66.8.11.1^and the name of the star is called - wormwood.
66.8.11.2^and became a third of the waters into wormwood, and many of the men died from the waters, because they were made bitter.
66.8.12.1^and the fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and was struck a third of the sun, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that should be darkened a third of them, and the day not should appear for a third of it, and the night likewise.
66.8.13.1^and i looked, and i heard one eagle flying in mid-heaven, saying in a voice loud, woe!
66.8.13.2^woe!
66.8.13.3^woe to those dwelling on the earth, because of the remaining voices of the trumpet of the three angels - being about to sound their trumpets!
66.9.1.1^and the fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and i saw a star out of - heaven having fallen to the earth, and was given to it the key of the pit of the abyss.
66.9.2.1^and he opened the pit of the abyss, and went up smoke out of the pit, like the smoke of a furnace great, and were darkened the sun and the air by the smoke of the pit.
66.9.3.1^and out of the smoke came forth locusts unto the earth, and was given to them power, like have power the scorpions of the earth.
66.9.4.1^and it was said to them, that not they shall harm the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, if not the men - not having the seal - of god on the foreheads.
66.9.5.1^and it was granted to them that not they should kill them, but that they shall torment them months five.
66.9.5.2^and the torment of them was like torment of a scorpion, when it might strike a man.
66.9.6.1^and in the days those, will seek - men - death, and not no more will find it;
66.9.6.2^and they will long to die, and shall flee - death from them.
66.9.7.1^and the appearance of the locusts was like horses having been prepared for battle, and upon the heads of them were something like crowns, like gold;
66.9.7.2^and the faces of them like the faces of men.
66.9.8.1^and they had hair like hair of women, and the teeth of them like those of lions were.
66.9.9.1^and they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of the wings of them was as the sound of chariots of horses many rushing into battle.
66.9.10.1^and they have tails like scorpions and stingers, and in the tails of them is the power of them to injure - men for months five.
66.9.11.1^they have over them a king, the angel of the abyss.
66.9.11.2^the name of him in hebrew is abaddon, and in the greek, the name he has apollyon.
66.9.12.1^- woe the first has passed.
66.9.12.2^behold, are coming still two woes after these things.
66.9.13.1^and the sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and i heard voice one from the four horns of the altar - golden - before - god,
66.9.14.1^saying to the sixth angel, the one having the trumpet, release the four angels, those having been bound at the river - great euphrates.
66.9.15.1^and were released the four angels - having been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, so that they might kill a third - of mankind.
66.9.16.1^and the number of the armies of the cavalry was twice ten thousand ten thousands;
66.9.16.2^i heard the number of them.
66.9.17.1^and thus i saw the horses in the vision, and those sitting on them, having breastplates fiery and hyacinthine and brimstone.
66.9.17.2^and the heads of the horses were like heads of lions, and out of the mouths of them proceed fire, and smoke, and brimstone.
66.9.18.1^by - three plagues these was killed a third of mankind, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, - proceeding out of the mouths of them.
66.9.19.1^the for powers of the horses in the mouths of them are, and in the tails of them;
66.9.19.2^the for tails of them are like serpents, having heads, and with them they injure.
66.9.20.1^and the rest of the men who not were killed by the plagues these not even repented of the works of the hands of them, so that not they will worship the demons, and the idols - golden and - silver and - bronze and - stone and - wooden, which neither to see are able, nor to hear, nor to walk.
66.9.21.1^and not they repented of the murders of them, nor of the sorceries of them, nor of the sexual immorality of them, nor of the thefts of them.
66.10.1.1^and i saw another angel mighty coming down out of - heaven, clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow upon the head of him, and the face of him was like the sun, and the feet of him like pillars of fire,
66.10.2.1^and having in the hand of him a little scroll being open.
66.10.2.2^and he placed the foot of him - right upon the sea, the and left upon the earth.
66.10.3.1^and he cried out in a voice loud as a lion roars.
66.10.3.2^and when he cried out, sounded the seven thunders, the of themselves voice.
66.10.4.1^and when had spoken the seven thunders, i was about to write.
66.10.4.2^but i heard a voice out of - heaven, saying, seal what have spoken the seven thunders, and not them write.
66.10.5.1^and the angel whom i saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up the hand of him the right to - heaven,
66.10.6.1^and he swore by the one living to the ages of the ages, who created - heaven and the things in it, and the earth and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it -, delay no longer will there be!
66.10.7.1^but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound the trumpet, then would be completed the mystery - of god, as proclaimed the of himself servants, the prophets.
66.10.8.1^and the voice that i heard out of - heaven again was speaking with me, and saying, go, take the little scroll - having been opened in the hand of the angel - standing upon the sea, and upon the land.
66.10.9.1^and i went to the angel, saying to him give me the little scroll.
66.10.9.2^and he says to me, take and eat it;
66.10.9.3^and it will make bitter your - stomach, but in the mouth of you it will be sweet as honey.
66.10.10.1^and i took the little scroll out of the hand of the angel, and i ate it;
66.10.10.2^and it was in the mouth of me as honey sweet;
66.10.10.3^and when i had eaten it, was made bitter the stomach of me.
66.10.11.1^and they say to me, it is necessary for you again to prophesy concerning peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings many.
66.11.1.1^and was given to me a measuring rod like a staff, saying, rise and measure the temple - of god, and the altar, and those worshiping in it.
66.11.2.1^and the courtyard - outside the temple, leave out, and not it measure, because it has been given up to the nations, and the city - holy they will trample upon months forty and two.
66.11.3.1^and i will grant to the two witnesses of me, and they will prophesy days a thousand two hundred sixty, clothed in sackcloth.
66.11.4.1^these are the two olive trees and the two lampstands - before the lord of the earth standing.
66.11.5.1^and if anyone them should desire to harm, fire goes out of the mouth of them and devours the enemies of them.
66.11.5.2^and if anyone should desire them to harm, thus it is necessary for him to be killed.
66.11.6.1^these have the power to shut the sky, so that no rain shall fall in the days of the prophecy of them;
66.11.6.2^and power they have over the waters, to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as if they might desire.
66.11.7.1^and when they shall have completed the testimony of them, the beast - coming up out of the abyss will make with them war, and will overcome them, and will kill them.
66.11.8.1^and the body of them will be upon the street of city the great, which is called figuratively sodom and egypt, where also the lord of them was crucified.
66.11.9.1^and gaze those of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations upon the bodies of them, days three and a half, and the bodies of them not they will allow to be put into a tomb.
66.11.10.1^and those dwelling on the earth rejoice over them and make merry, and gifts will send to one another, because these - two prophets have tormented those dwelling upon the earth.
66.11.11.1^and after the three days and a half, the spirit of life from - god entered into them, and they stood upon the feet of them;
66.11.11.2^and fear great fell upon those beholding them.
66.11.12.1^and they heard a voice great out of - heaven, saying to them, come up here.
66.11.12.2^and they went up to - heaven in the cloud;
66.11.12.3^and beheld them the enemies of them.
66.11.13.1^and in that - hour there was an earthquake great, and a tenth of the city fell, and were killed in the earthquake, names of men thousand seven.
66.11.13.2^and the rest terrified became and gave glory to the god of heaven.
66.11.14.1^the woe - second has passed.
66.11.14.2^behold, the woe - third is coming quickly.
66.11.15.1^and the seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were voices great in - heaven, saying:
66.11.15.2^has become the kingdom of the world, that of the lord of us, and of the christ of him, and he will reign to the ages of the ages.
66.11.16.1^and the twenty four elders - before - god sitting on the thrones of them fell upon the faces of them and worshiped - god,
66.11.17.1^saying:
66.11.17.2^we give thanks to you, lord - god - almighty, the one being, and who was, that you have taken the power of you - great, and have begun to reign.
66.11.18.1^and the nations were enraged, and came the wrath of you, and the time for the dead to be judged, and to give the reward to the servants of you, the prophets, and to the saints, and to those fearing the name of you, the small and the great, and to destroy those who are destroying the earth.
66.11.19.1^and was opened the temple - of god - in - heaven, and was seen the ark of the covenant of him in the temple of him.
66.11.19.2^and there were flashes of lightning, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and hail great.
66.12.1.1^and a sign great appeared in - heaven:
66.12.1.2^a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under the feet of her, and on the head of her a crown of stars twelve,
66.12.2.1^and in womb having.
66.12.2.2^and she cries out, being in travail, and being in pain to bring forth.
66.12.3.1^and was seen another sign in - heaven, and behold, a dragon great, red having heads seven, and horns ten, and upon the heads of him, seven royal crowns.
66.12.4.1^and the tail of him drags a third of the stars of heaven, and he cast them to the earth.
66.12.4.2^and the dragon stands before the woman - being about to bring forth, so that when she should bring forth, the child of her he might devour.
66.12.5.1^and she brought forth a son male, who is about to rule all the nations with a rod of iron;
66.12.5.2^and was caught up the child of her to - god, and to the throne of him.
66.12.6.1^and the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has there a place having been prepared by - god, so that there they should nourish her days one thousand two hundred sixty.
66.12.7.1^and there was war in - heaven:
66.12.7.2^- michael and the angels of him - warred against the dragon, and the dragon warred back, and the angels of him.
66.12.8.1^and not had he strength, nor a place was found for them any longer in - heaven.
66.12.9.1^and was thrown out the dragon - great, the serpent - ancient, who is called the devil and - satan, - deceiving the inhabited world whole.
66.12.9.2^he was thrown down to the earth, and the angels of him with him were thrown down.
66.12.10.1^and i heard a voice great in - heaven, saying:
66.12.10.2^now have come the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of the god of us, and the authority the christ of him, because has been thrown down the accuser of the brothers of us, the one accusing them before the god of us day and night.
66.12.11.1^and they have overcome him by reason of the blood of the lamb, and by reason of the word of the testimony of them;
66.12.11.2^and not they have loved the life of them unto death.
66.12.12.1^because of this, rejoice o heavens, and those in them dwelling!
66.12.12.2^woe to the earth and the sea, because has come down the devil to you, having fury great, knowing that a short time he has.
66.12.13.1^and when saw the dragon that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had brought forth the male child.
66.12.14.1^and were given to the woman the two wings of the eagle - great, so that she could fly into the wilderness, into the place of her, where she is nourished there a time, and times, and half a time from the face of the serpent.
66.12.15.1^and cast the serpent out of the mouth of him after the woman water as a river, so that her carried away by a flood he might cause to be.
66.12.16.1^and helped the earth the woman, and opened the earth the mouth of it and swallowed up the river, which had cast the dragon out of the mouth of him.
66.12.17.1^and was angry the dragon with the woman, and went to make war with the rest of the children of her - keeping the commandments - of god and holding the testimony of jesus.
66.12.18.1^and he stood upon the sand of the sea.
66.13.1.1^and i saw out of the sea a beast rising, having horns ten, and heads seven, and on the horns of it, ten royal crowns, and upon the heads of it, names of blasphemy.
66.13.2.1^and the beast that i saw was like a leopard, and the feet of it like a bear s, and the mouth of it like the mouth of a lion.
66.13.2.2^and gave to it the dragon the power of him, and the throne of him, and authority great.
66.13.3.1^and one of the heads of it was as having been slain to death.
66.13.3.2^and the wound of death of it was healed, and marveled all the earth after the beast.
66.13.4.1^and they worshiped the dragon, who had given - authority to the beast;
66.13.4.2^and they worshiped the beast, saying, who is like the beast?
66.13.4.3^and who is able to make war against it?
66.13.5.1^and was given to it a mouth speaking great things and blasphemy;
66.13.5.2^and was given to it authority to act months forty and two.
66.13.6.1^and it opened the mouth of it unto blasphemies against - god, to blaspheme the name of him, and the tabernacle of him, those in - heaven dwelling.
66.13.7.1^and there was given to it to make war with the saints, and to overcome them.
66.13.7.2^and was given to it authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.
66.13.8.1^and will worship it all - dwelling on the earth, of whom not have been written the names of them in the book - of life of the lamb - having been slain, from the founding of the world.
66.13.9.1^if anyone has an ear, let him hear.
66.13.10.1^if anyone is to go into captivity, into captivity he goes;
66.13.10.2^if anyone with the sword is to be killed, he by the sword is to be killed.
66.13.10.3^here is the endurance and the faith of the saints.
66.13.11.1^and i saw another beast rising out of the earth, and it had horns two like a lamb, and it was speaking like a dragon.
66.13.12.1^and the authority of the first beast all it exercises on behalf of it, and causes the earth and those in it dwelling, that they will worship the beast - first, of whom had been healed the wound - fatal of it.
66.13.13.1^and it works signs great, so that even fire it should cause out of - heaven to come down to the earth in the presence - of men.
66.13.14.1^and it deceives those dwelling on the earth, by reason of the signs that were given to it to perform before the beast, telling those dwelling on the earth to make an image to the beast that has the wound of the sword and has lived.
66.13.15.1^and there was given to it to give breath to the image of the beast, so that also should speak the image of the beast, and should cause that as many as if not would worship the image of the beast would be killed.
66.13.16.1^and it causes all the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the servants, that it should give them a mark on the hand of them - right, or on the forehead of them,
66.13.17.1^and that no one should be able to buy or to sell, if not the one having the mark   the name of the beast, or the number of the name of it.
66.13.18.1^here the wisdom is.
66.13.18.2^the one having understanding, let him count the number of the beast;
66.13.18.3^number for a man s it is, and the number is of it, six hundred sixty six.
66.14.1.1^and i looked, and behold, the lamb was standing upon - mount zion, and with him one hundred forty four thousand, having the name of him and the name of the father of him having been written on the foreheads of them.
66.14.2.1^and i heard a voice out of - heaven, as the sound of waters many, and as the sound of thunder loud.
66.14.2.2^and the voice that i heard, was like that of harpists harping with the harps of them.
66.14.3.1^and they are singing as a song new before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders.
66.14.3.2^and no one was able to learn the song, if not the one hundred forty four thousand - having been redeemed from the earth.
66.14.4.1^these are they who with women not have not been defiled;
66.14.4.2^pure for they are, these - following the lamb wherever - he shall go.
66.14.4.3^these have been redeemed out from - men as firstfruits - to god and to the lamb.
66.14.5.1^and in the mouth of them not was found a lie;
66.14.5.2^blameless they are.
66.14.6.1^and i saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having the glad tidings everlasting to preach upon those dwelling on the earth, and upon every nation and tribe and tongue and people,
66.14.7.1^saying in a voice loud, fear - god, and give him glory, because has come the hour of the judgment of him.
66.14.7.2^and worship the one having made - heaven, and the earth, and sea, and springs of waters.
66.14.8.1^and another angel, a second followed, saying, fallen, fallen is babylon the great, who of the wine - of wrath for the immorality of her, she has given to drink all the gentiles.
66.14.9.1^and another angel, a third, followed them, saying in a voice loud, if anyone worships the beast and the image of it, and receives a mark on the forehead of him, or upon the hand of him,
66.14.10.1^also he will drink of the wine of the anger - of god, - having been mixed undiluted in the cup of the wrath of him;
66.14.10.2^and he will be tormented in fire and brimstone, before the angels holy, and before the lamb.
66.14.11.1^and the smoke of the torment of them to ages of ages goes up;
66.14.11.2^and not have rest day and night those worshiping the beast and the image of it, and if anyone receives the mark of the name of it.
66.14.12.1^here the endurance of the saints is, those keeping the commandments - of god, and the faith of jesus.
66.14.13.1^and i heard a voice out of - heaven, saying write, blessed are the dead - in the lord dying from now on.
66.14.13.2^yes, says the spirit, so that they will rest from the labors of them;
66.14.13.3^- for the works of them follow with them.
66.14.14.1^and i looked, and behold, a cloud white, and upon the cloud is sitting one like the son of man, having on the head of him a crown golden, and in the hand of him a sickle sharp.
66.14.15.1^and another angel came out of the temple, crying in a voice loud to the one sitting on the cloud, put forth the sickle of you and reap, because has come the hour to reap, because has ripened the harvest of the earth.
66.14.16.1^and swung the one sitting upon the cloud the sickle of him upon the earth, and was harvested the earth.
66.14.17.1^and another angel came out of the temple - in - heaven, having also he a sickle sharp.
66.14.18.1^and another angel came out of the altar, - having authority over the fire, and he called in a voice loud to the one having the sickle - sharp, saying, put forth your - sickle - sharp, and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth, because have fully ripened the grapes of it.
66.14.19.1^and put forth the angel the sickle of him to the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast them into the winepress of the wrath - of god - great.
66.14.20.1^and was trodden the winepress outside the city, and flowed blood out of the winepress, as high as the bridles of the horses, to the distance of stadia one thousand six hundred.
66.15.1.1^and i saw another sign in - heaven, great and wonderful, angels seven having plagues seven   the last, because in them was completed the wrath - of god.
66.15.2.1^and i saw something like a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those conquering over the beast, and of the image of it, and over the number of the name of it, standing upon the sea of the glass, having harps - of god.
66.15.3.1^and they are singing the song of moses, the servant of god, and the song of the lamb, saying:
66.15.3.2^great and wonderful are the works of you, lord - god the almighty!
66.15.3.3^righteous and true are the ways of you, o king of the nations!
66.15.4.1^who no not should fear you, o lord, and will glorify the name of you?
66.15.4.2^for you alone are holy.
66.15.4.3^for all the nations will come and will worship before you, because the righteous acts of you have been revealed.
66.15.5.1^and after these things i looked, and was opened the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in - heaven.
66.15.6.1^and came forth the seven angels - having the seven plagues out of the temple, having been clothed in linen pure bright, and having been girded with around the chests sashes golden.
66.15.7.1^and one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven bowls golden full of the wrath - of god, the one living to the ages of the ages.
66.15.8.1^and was filled the temple with smoke from the glory - of god, and from the power of him;
66.15.8.2^and no one was able to enter into the temple until were completed the seven plagues of the seven angels.
66.16.1.1^and i heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath - of god into the earth.
66.16.2.1^and departed the first, and poured out the bowl of him into the earth;
66.16.2.2^and came a sore, evil and grievous, upon the men - having the mark of the beast and those worshiping the image of it.
66.16.3.1^and the second poured out the bowl of him into the sea, and it became blood, as of one dead;
66.16.3.2^and every soul living died that was in the sea.
66.16.4.1^and the third poured out the bowl of him into the rivers and the springs of the waters, and they became blood.
66.16.5.1^and i heard the angel of the waters saying:
66.16.5.2^righteous are you, the one being, and - having been, o holy one, because these things you have judged,
66.16.6.1^because the blood of saints and of prophets they have poured out, and blood to them you have given to drink;
66.16.6.2^worthy they are.
66.16.7.1^and i heard the altar saying:
66.16.7.2^yes, lord - god - almighty, true and righteous are the judgments of you.
66.16.8.1^and the fourth poured out the bowl of him upon the sun, and there was given to it to scorch - men with fire.
66.16.9.1^and were scorched the men with heat great, and they cursed the name - of god, the one having - authority over the plagues these;
66.16.9.2^and not did they repent to give him glory.
66.16.10.1^and the fifth poured out the bowl of him upon the throne of the beast, and became the kingdom of it darkened, and they were gnawing the tongues of them for the distress,
66.16.11.1^and they cursed the god of heaven on account of the distresses of them, and on account of the sores of them;
66.16.11.2^and not they did repent of the works of them.
66.16.12.1^and the sixth poured out the bowl of him upon the river - great - euphrates, and was dried up the water of it, so that might be prepared the way of the kings - of the rising of the sun.
66.16.13.1^and i saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, spirits three unclean, like frogs;
66.16.14.1^they are for spirits of demons performing signs, which go forth to the kings of the inhabited world whole, to gather together them unto the battle of the day - great - of god the almighty.
66.16.15.1^behold, i am coming like a thief.
66.16.15.2^blessed is the one watching and keeping the garments of him, so that not naked he should walk and they might see the shame of him.
66.16.16.1^and he gathered together them unto the place - called in hebrew armageddon.
66.16.17.1^and the seventh poured out the bowl of him upon the air, and came out a voice loud from the temple from the throne, saying, it is done!
66.16.18.1^and there were flashes of lightning, and voices, and thunders;
66.16.18.2^and an earthquake there was great, such as not had there been since - men were upon the earth, so great was the earthquake, so mighty.
66.16.19.1^and was split the city - great into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell;
66.16.19.2^and babylon the great was remembered before - god, to give her the cup of the wine of the fury the wrath of him.
66.16.20.1^and every island fled, and mountains not were to be found.
66.16.21.1^and a hail great, about a talent weight, comes down out of - heaven upon the men.
66.16.21.2^and blasphemed the men - god on account of the plague of the hail, for severe is the plague of it exceedingly.
66.17.1.1^and came one of the seven angels - having the seven bowls, and spoke with me, saying, come here, i will show you the punishment of the prostitute - great, the one sitting upon waters many,
66.17.2.1^with whom have committed sexual immorality the kings of the earth, and have been made drunk those that dwelling on the earth with the wine of the sexual immorality of her.
66.17.3.1^and he carried away me into a wilderness in the spirit, and i saw a woman sitting upon a beast scarlet, being full of names of blasphemy, having heads seven and horns ten.
66.17.4.1^and the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and stone precious and pearls, holding a cup golden in the hand of her, being full of abominations and the impurity of the sexual immorality of her.
66.17.5.1^and upon the forehead of her a name was written, a mystery:
66.17.5.2^babylon the great, the mother of the prostitutes, and of the abominations of the earth.
66.17.6.1^and i saw the woman being drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of jesus.
66.17.6.2^and i marveled, having seen her, with wonder great.
66.17.7.1^and said to me the angel, because of why did you marvel?
66.17.7.2^i will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast - carrying her, - having the seven heads, and the ten horns.
66.17.8.1^the beast that you saw was, and not is, and is about to come up out of the abyss and into destruction go;
66.17.8.2^and will wonder those dwelling on the earth, whose not are written - names in the book - of life from the foundation of the world, seeing the beast which was, and not is, and yet will be.
66.17.9.1^here is the mind - having wisdom:
66.17.9.2^the seven heads, seven mountains are, where the woman sits on them.
66.17.9.3^and kings seven there are.
66.17.10.1^the five are fallen, the one is, the other not yet has come;
66.17.10.2^and when he shall have come, a little while him it behooves to remain.
66.17.11.1^and the beast which was, and not is, also himself an eighth is, and of the seven is, and into destruction goes.
66.17.12.1^and the ten horns which you saw, ten kings are, who a kingdom not yet have received, but authority as kings one hour receive, along with the beast.
66.17.13.1^these one mind have, and the power and authority of themselves, to the beast they shall give up.
66.17.14.1^these with the lamb war will make, and the lamb will overcome them, because lord of lords he is, and king of kings;
66.17.14.2^and those with him are called and chosen and faithful.
66.17.15.1^and he says to me, the waters that you saw, where the prostitute sits, peoples and multitudes are, and nations and tongues.
66.17.16.1^and the ten horns that you saw, and the beast, these will hate the prostitute, and desolate will make her, and naked;
66.17.16.2^and the flesh of her they will eat, and her they will burn with fire.
66.17.17.1^- for god has put into the hearts of them to do the purpose of him, and to do one purpose, and to give the kingdom of them to the beast, until will be fulfilled the words - of god.
66.17.18.1^and the woman whom you saw is the city - great, - having kingship over the kings of the earth.
66.18.1.1^after these things i saw another angel descending out of - heaven, having authority great;
66.18.1.2^and the earth was illuminated from the glory of him.
66.18.2.1^and he cried out in a mighty voice, saying:
66.18.2.2^fallen, fallen is babylon the great!
66.18.2.3^and she has become a habitation of demons, and a prison of every spirit unclean, and a prison of every bird unclean, and a prison of every creature unclean and having been hated.
66.18.3.1^for of the wine of the wrath of the sexual immorality of her, have drunk all the nations;
66.18.3.2^and the kings of the earth with her have committed sexual immorality;
66.18.3.3^and the merchants of the earth through the power of the sensuality of her have been enriched.
66.18.4.1^and i heard another voice from - heaven, saying:
66.18.4.2^come the people of me, out of her, so that not you may have fellowship in the sins of her, and of the plagues of her so that not you may receive.
66.18.5.1^for have been heaped her - sins as high as - heaven, and has remembered - god the iniquities of her.
66.18.6.1^give back to her as also she has rendered;

66.18.6.3^in the cup which she has mixed, mix to her double.
66.18.7.1^so much as she has glorified herself and lived in luxury, as much give to her torment and misery, because in the heart of herself she says -, i sit as a queen, and a widow never i am, and mourning never not shall i see.
