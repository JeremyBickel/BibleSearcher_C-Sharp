was bar-jesus
was brought
was darkened
was governing
was signifying
waterless
week
welling up
were abiding
were crying out
were denying it
were eating
were going
were going away
were going out
were happening
were listening
were speaking
were standing
west
what way
when
when it was
when the rooster crows
whence
where
whereof
which is christ
which is strangled
while are going away
while they were disbelieving
who are set against
whom is
whose are
whose is
wild animals
window
winter stream
with a great
with a price
with all
with anger
with bread
with confusion
with demons
with food
with good things
with it
with jealousy
with rage
with smoke
with vinegar
with whom he is pleased
without strength
wondering
word of mouth
words 
working with them
your left hand
your right hand
youth
