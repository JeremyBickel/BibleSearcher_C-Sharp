1261 ^ - of god,
1263 ^ speak,
1264 ^ that the stones these, loaves of bread might become.
1270 ^ - but
1272 ^ answering, he said,
1274 ^ it has been written:
1275 ^ not by bread alone shall live the man,
1282 ^ but by every word
1286 ^ coming out of [the] mouth of god.’

1307 ^ and says to him,
1310 ^ if son you are
1313 ^ - of god,
1315 ^ throw yourself down;

1320 ^ -: to the angels of him he will give orders concerning you,
1327 ^ and in [their] hands will they bear up you,
1332 ^ lest ever you strike against a stone the foot of you.’
1339 ^ said to him - jesus, again
1344 ^ it has been written:
1345 ^ not you shall test [the] lord the god of you.’
1351 ^ again takes him the devil to a mountain high exceedingly,
1360 ^ and shows to him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them,
1372 ^ and he says to him,
1375 ^ these things to you
1377 ^ all will i give,
1379 ^ if
1380 ^ falling down, you will worship me.
1383 ^ then says to him - jesus,
1388 ^ get you away, satan;
1390 ^ it has been written for:
1392 ^ [the] lord the god of you, you shall worship,
1397 ^ and him alone shall you serve.’
1401 ^ then leaves him the devil,
1406 ^ and behold,
1408 ^ angels came
1410 ^ and were ministering to him.
1413 ^ having heard now
1415 ^ that john had been delivered up , he withdrew into - galilee.
1422 ^ and
1423 ^ having left - nazareth,
1426 ^ having come, he dwelt at capernaum, which [is] on the sea-side in [the] region of zebulun and naphtali,
1437 ^ that it might be fulfilled
1439 ^ that having been spoken by isaiah the prophet,
1445 ^ saying:
1446 ^ land of zebulun and land of naphtali, way of [the] sea, beyond the jordan, galilee of the gentiles —
1459 ^ the people
1461 ^ - sitting in darkness, a light have seen
1467 ^ great,
1468 ^ and to those sitting in [the] land and shadow of death,
1476 ^ a light has dawned on them.”
1479 ^ from that time began - jesus
1484 ^ to proclaim
1485 ^ and to say,
1487 ^ repent,
1488 ^ has drawn near for the kingdom of the heavens.
1494 ^ walking now beside the sea - of galilee, he saw two brothers, simon
1505 ^ - called peter, and andrew the brother of him,
1513 ^ casting a net into the sea;
1518 ^ they were for fishermen.
1521 ^ and he says to them,
1524 ^ come follow after me,
1527 ^ and i will make you fishers of men.
1532 ^ - and immediately
1535 ^ having left the nets, they followed him.
1540 ^ and
1541 ^ having gone on from there, he saw others, two brothers, james the [son] - of zebedee, and john the brother of him,
1556 ^ in the boat with zebedee the father of them, mending the nets of them;
1568 ^ and he called them.
1571 ^ - and immediately,
1574 ^ having left the boat and the father of them, they followed him.
1583 ^ and he was going throughout all - galilee,
1589 ^ teaching in the synagogues of them,
1594 ^ and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom,
1600 ^ and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
1610 ^ and went out the news of him into all - syria.
1619 ^ and they brought to him all
1623 ^ the sick
1625 ^ having
1626 ^ various diseases and pains oppressing,
1631 ^ and being possessed by demons,
1633 ^ and being epileptics, and paralytics;
1637 ^ and he healed them.
1640 ^ and followed him crowds great from - galilee, and [the] decapolis, and jerusalem, and judea, and beyond the jordan.
1658 ^ having seen then the crowds, he went up on the mountain;
1666 ^ and having sat down of him,
1669 ^ came to him the disciples of him.
1674 ^ and
1675 ^ opening the mouth of him, he was teaching them,
1681 ^ saying:
1682 ^ blessed [are] the poor in the spirit,
1687 ^ for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.
1694 ^ blessed [are]
1695 ^ those mourning,
1697 ^ for they will be comforted.
1700 ^ blessed the meek,
1703 ^ for they will inherit the earth.
1708 ^ blessed [are]
1709 ^ those hungering
1711 ^ and thirsting for - righteousness;
1715 ^ for they will be filled.
1718 ^ blessed [are] the merciful,
1721 ^ for they will receive mercy.
1724 ^ blessed the pure - in heart,
1729 ^ for they - god will see.
1734 ^ blessed the peacemakers,
1737 ^ for they sons of god will be called.
1742 ^ blessed [are]
1743 ^ those having been persecuted on account of righteousness,
1747 ^ for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.
1754 ^ blessed are you
1756 ^ when they shall insult you,
1759 ^ and shall persecute [you],
1761 ^ and shall say all kinds of evil against you,
1767 ^ lying on account of me.
1770 ^ rejoice
1771 ^ and exult,
1773 ^ for the reward of you [is] great in the heavens;
1781 ^ thus for they persecuted the prophets - before you.
1789 ^ you are the salt of the earth;
1795 ^ if, however, the salt becomes tasteless,
1800 ^ with what will it be salted.
1803 ^ for nothing it is potent any longer,
1807 ^ if not
1809 ^ having been cast out, to be trampled upon by - men.
1815 ^ you are the light of the world.
1821 ^ not is able a city
1824 ^ to be hidden
2582 ^ in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets standing to pray,
2593 ^ so that they might be seen - by men.
2597 ^ truly i say to you,
2600 ^ they have the reward of them.
2604 ^ you however,
2606 ^ when you pray, enter into the room
2612 ^ of you,
2613 ^ and
2614 ^ having shut the door of you, pray to father of you, the [one] in - secret.
2626 ^ and the father of you,
2630 ^ the [one] seeing in - secret, will reward you.
2637 ^ praying now not do use vain repetitions,
2641 ^ like the pagans,
2644 ^ they think for
2646 ^ that in the many words of them they will be heard.
2652 ^ not therefore be like to them,
2656 ^ knows for the father of you
2661 ^ of what things need you have,
2664 ^ before - your
2667 ^ asking him.
2669 ^ thus therefore pray you:
2673 ^ father of us, who [is] in the heavens, hallowed be the name of you.
2683 ^ come the kingdom of you;
2687 ^ be done the will of you, as in heaven, [so] also upon earth.
2697 ^ the bread of us - daily grant us today.
2705 ^ and forgive us the debts of us,
2711 ^ as also we forgive the debtors of us;
2718 ^ and not lead us into temptation,
2724 ^ but deliver us from - evil.’
2730 ^ if for you forgive - men the trespasses of them,
2738 ^ will forgive also you the father of you - heavenly.
2746 ^ if however not you forgive - men,
2752 ^ neither the father of you will forgive the trespasses of you.
2760 ^ whenever now you fast,
2763 ^ not be like the hypocrites, gloomy;
2769 ^ they disfigure for the appearance of them,
2774 ^ so that they might appear - to men
2778 ^ [as] fasting.
2779 ^ truly i say to you,
2782 ^ they have the reward of them.
2786 ^ you however,
2788 ^ fasting, anoint your - head
2793 ^ and the face of you wash,
2798 ^ so that not you might appear - to men
2803 ^ [as] fasting,
2804 ^ but - to father your the [one] in - secret;
2812 ^ and the father of you,
2816 ^ the [one] seeing in - secret, will reward you.
2823 ^ not store up for yourselves treasures upon the earth,
2830 ^ where moth and rust destroy,
2835 ^ and where thieves break in
2839 ^ and steal;
2841 ^ store up however for yourselves treasures in heaven,
2847 ^ where neither moth nor rust destroy,
2853 ^ and where thieves not do break in
2858 ^ nor steal.
2860 ^ where for is the treasure of you,
2866 ^ there will be also the heart of you.
2872 ^ the lamp of the body is the eye.
2879 ^ if therefore is the eye of you clear,
2886 ^ [the] whole - body of you full of light will be.
2892 ^ if however the eye of you evil is,
2899 ^ all the body of you full of darkness will be.
2905 ^ if then the light that [is] within you darkness is,
2914 ^ that darkness how great!
2917 ^ no one is able

2938 ^ not you are able
2940 ^ god to serve,
2942 ^ and money.
2944 ^ because of this i say to you,
2948 ^ not be anxious about the life of you,
2953 ^ what you should eat
2955 ^ or what you should drink;
2958 ^ nor the body of you,
2962 ^ what you should put on.
2964 ^ not the life more is
2969 ^ than the food,
2971 ^ and the body than clothing?
2976 ^ look at the birds of the air,

2985 ^ nor do they reap,
2987 ^ nor do they gather into barns —
2991 ^ and the father of you - heavenly feeds them.
2999 ^ not you much are more valuable than they?
3004 ^ who now
3006 ^ from you
3008 ^ being anxious is able
3010 ^ to add to the lifespan of him hour one?
3017 ^ and about clothing why are you anxious?
3022 ^ observe the lilies of the field,
3027 ^ how they grow:
3029 ^ [they do] not labor
3031 ^ nor do they spin.
3033 ^ i say however to you
3036 ^ that not even solomon in all the glory of him was adorned
3045 ^ like one of these.
3048 ^ if however the grass of the field,
3054 ^ today being [here],
3056 ^ and tomorrow into the furnace being thrown, - god thus clothes,
3065 ^ [will he] not much more you, o [you] of little faith?
3070 ^ not therefore be anxious,
3073 ^ saying,
3074 ^ what shall we eat?
3076 ^ or what shall we drink?
3079 ^ or what shall we wear?
3082 ^ all for
3084 ^ these things the gentiles seek after;
3088 ^ knows for the father of you - heavenly
3095 ^ that you have need of them all.
3099 ^ seek however first the kingdom of god and the righteousness of him,
3110 ^ and these things all will be added to you.
3115 ^ not therefore be anxious about things tomorrow,
3121 ^ - for
3123 ^ tomorrow will be anxious about itself.
3126 ^ sufficient to the day [is] the trouble of it.
3132 ^ not do judge,
3134 ^ that not you should be judged.
3137 ^ with whatever for
3140 ^ verdict you judge,
3142 ^ you will be judged;
3143 ^ and with whatever measure you measure,

3150 ^ why now do you look at the splinter that [is] in the eye the brother of you,
3162 ^ - and
3164 ^ the in - your [own] eye beam not notice?
3171 ^ or how shall you say to the brother of you,
3177 ^ permit that
3178 ^ i might cast out the splinter from the eye of you;
3185 ^ and behold,
3187 ^ the beam [is] in the eye of you?
3193 ^ hypocrite! cast out first from the eye of you the beam,
3202 ^ and then you will see clearly
3205 ^ to cast out the splinter from the eye of the brother of you.
3214 ^ not give that which [is] holy to the dogs,
3220 ^ nor cast the pearls of you before the pigs,
3228 ^ not lest they shall trample upon them with the feet of them,
3235 ^ and
3236 ^ having turned, they tear to pieces you.
3239 ^ ask
3240 ^ and it will be given to you;

3244 ^ and you will find;

3247 ^ and it will be opened to you.
3250 ^ everyone for
3793 ^ having heard now, - jesus marveled,
3798 ^ and said
3800 ^ to those following,
3802 ^ truly i say to you,
3805 ^ except no one so great faith in - israel have i found.
3813 ^ i say now to you
3816 ^ that many from east and west will come,
3823 ^ and will recline with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of the heavens;
3836 ^ the however
3838 ^ sons of the kingdom will be cast out, into the darkness the outer,
3847 ^ there will be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.
3856 ^ and said - jesus to the centurion,
3862 ^ go,
3863 ^ as you have believed,
3865 ^ be it to you.
3867 ^ and was healed the servant of him in the hour that.
3876 ^ and
3877 ^ having come - jesus to the house of peter, he saw the mother-in-law of him
3888 ^ lying sick
3889 ^ and fevering.
3891 ^ and he touched the hand of her,
3896 ^ and left her the fever;
3901 ^ and she arose
3903 ^ and was ministering to them.
3906 ^ evening now having come,

3911 ^ being possessed with demons many,
3913 ^ and he cast out the spirits by a word,
3918 ^ and all
3920 ^ those sick
3922 ^ being, he healed,
3924 ^ so that it might be fulfilled
3926 ^ that having been spoken by isaiah the prophet,
3932 ^ saying,
3933 ^ himself the infirmities of us he took,
3938 ^ and our diseases bore.”
3942 ^ having seen now - jesus a crowd around him, he commanded
3950 ^ to depart to the other side.
3954 ^ and
3955 ^ having come to [him], one scribe said to him,
3960 ^ teacher, i will follow you
3963 ^ wherever if you might go.
3966 ^ and says to him - jesus,
3971 ^ - foxes holes have,
3975 ^ and the birds of the air nests;
3981 ^ - but
3983 ^ the son - of man, no has
3988 ^ [place] where the head he might lay.
3992 ^ another now
3994 ^ of the disciples of him said to him,
3999 ^ lord, allow me first
4003 ^ to go
4004 ^ and to bury the father of me.
4009 ^ - but
4011 ^ jesus said to him,
4014 ^ follow me,
4016 ^ and leave the dead
4020 ^ to bury - their own dead.
4024 ^ and having entered he into the boat,
4030 ^ followed him the disciples of him.
4035 ^ and behold,
4037 ^ a storm great arose in the sea,
4043 ^ so that the boat was being swamped by the waves;
4050 ^ he himself however was sleeping.
4053 ^ and
4054 ^ having come to [him], they awoke him,
4057 ^ saying,
4058 ^ lord, save us,
4060 ^ we are perishing!
4061 ^ and he says to them,
4064 ^ why fearful are you, o [you] of little faith?
4068 ^ then,
4069 ^ having arisen, he rebuked the winds and the sea,
4076 ^ and there was a calm great.
4080 ^ - and
4082 ^ the men marveled,
4084 ^ saying,
4085 ^ what kind [of man] is this,
4088 ^ that even the winds and the sea him obey?
4097 ^ and having come he to the other side, to the region of the gadarenes,
4108 ^ met him two
4111 ^ being possessed by demons,
4112 ^ out of the tombs coming forth,
4116 ^ violent extremely,
4118 ^ so that not was able anyone
4122 ^ to pass by the way that.
4127 ^ and behold,
4129 ^ they cried out,
4130 ^ saying,
4131 ^ what to us and to you, son - of god?
4138 ^ are you come here before [the] time
4142 ^ to torment us?
4144 ^ there was now far off from them a herd of pigs many,
4152 ^ feeding.
4153 ^ - and
4155 ^ the demons were begging him,
4158 ^ saying,
4159 ^ if you cast out us,
4162 ^ send away us into the herd - of pigs.
4169 ^ and he said to them,
4172 ^ go.
4173 ^ - and
4175 ^ having gone out they went away into the pigs;
4180 ^ and behold,
4182 ^ rushed all the herd down the steep bank into the sea,
4192 ^ and perished in the waters.
4325 ^ having arisen, take up your - mat,
4330 ^ and go to the house of you.
4336 ^ and
4337 ^ having arisen, he went away to the house of him.
4343 ^ having seen now, the crowds marveled
4348 ^ and glorified - god,
4352 ^ the [one] having given authority such - to men.
4358 ^ and
4359 ^ passing on - jesus from there, he saw a man
4365 ^ sitting at the tax booth,
4369 ^ matthew named.
4371 ^ and he says to him,
4374 ^ follow me.
4376 ^ and
4377 ^ having arisen, he followed him.
4380 ^ and it came to pass
4382 ^ of him reclining in the house,
4387 ^ that behold,
4389 ^ many tax collectors and sinners,
4393 ^ having come, were reclining with - jesus and the disciples of him.
4401 ^ and
4402 ^ having seen [it], the pharisees said to disciples of him,
4409 ^ because of why with the tax collectors and sinners eats the teacher of you?
4420 ^ - and
4422 ^ having heard, he said,
4424 ^ not need have
4427 ^ those being strong
4429 ^ of a physician,
4430 ^ but
4431 ^ those sick
4433 ^ being.
4434 ^ having gone however, learn
4437 ^ what is,
4439 ^ mercy i desire,
4441 ^ and not sacrifice.’
4444 ^ not for i came
4447 ^ to call [the] righteous,
4449 ^ but
4450 ^ sinners.
4451 ^ then come to him the disciples of john,
4457 ^ saying,
4458 ^ because of why we and the pharisees do fast many times;
4466 ^ the however
4468 ^ disciples of you not fast?
4472 ^ and said to them - jesus,
4477 ^ not can the sons of the bridechamber
4483 ^ mourn
4484 ^ as long as with them is the bridegroom?
4491 ^ will come however days
4494 ^ when shall have been taken away from them the bridegroom,
4500 ^ and then they will fast.
4503 ^ no one however puts a patch of cloth unshrunk on clothing old;
4512 ^ tears away for the patch of it from the garment,
4520 ^ and a worse tear emerges.
4524 ^ nor pour they wine new into wineskins old;
4531 ^ if now lest
4534 ^ are burst the wineskins,
4537 ^ and the wine is poured out,
4541 ^ and the wineskins are destroyed.
4545 ^ but they pour wine new into wineskins new,
4552 ^ and both are preserved.
4555 ^ these things of him speaking to them,
4559 ^ behold,
4560 ^ a ruler certain
4562 ^ having come, was kneeling down to him,
4565 ^ saying
4566 ^ -, the daughter of me presently has died;
4572 ^ but
4573 ^ having come, lay the hand of you upon her,
4580 ^ and she will live.
4582 ^ and
4583 ^ having arisen, - jesus followed him,
4588 ^ also the disciples of him.
4592 ^ and behold,
4594 ^ a woman
4595 ^ having had a flux of blood twelve years,
4598 ^ having come up behind [him], touched the fringe of the garment of him.
4606 ^ she was saying for within herself,
4610 ^ if only i shall touch the garment of him,
4616 ^ i will be healed.
4617 ^ - and
4619 ^ jesus,
4620 ^ having turned
4621 ^ and having seen her, said,
4625 ^ take courage, daughter;
4627 ^ the faith of you has cured you.
4632 ^ and was cured the woman from the hour very.
4640 ^ and
4641 ^ having come - jesus
4644 ^ into the house of the ruler,
4649 ^ and having seen the flute players and the crowd
4656 ^ making a commotion, he says,
4658 ^ go away.
4659 ^ not for is dead the girl,
4664 ^ but sleeps.
4666 ^ and they began to laugh at him.
4669 ^ when now had been put outside the crowd,
4674 ^ having entered, he took hold of the hand of her,
4679 ^ and arose the girl.
4683 ^ and went out the report this into all the land that.
4693 ^ and passing on from there - jesus,
4698 ^ followed him two blind [men],
4702 ^ crying out
4703 ^ and saying,
4705 ^ have mercy on us, son of david.
4709 ^ having come now into the house, came to him the blind [men],
4718 ^ and says to them - jesus,
4723 ^ believe you
4724 ^ that i am able
4726 ^ this to do?
4728 ^ they say to him,
4730 ^ yes, lord.
4732 ^ then he touched the eyes of them,
4737 ^ saying,
4738 ^ according to the faith of you be it to you.
4744 ^ and were opened their - eyes.
4749 ^ and strictly instructed them - jesus,
4754 ^ saying,
4755 ^ see that
4756 ^ no one knows.
4758 ^ - but
4760 ^ having gone out, they make known him in all the land that.
4768 ^ [as] they now were going out,
4771 ^ behold,
4772 ^ they brought to him a man mute,
4776 ^ possessed by a demon.
4777 ^ and having been cast out the demon,
4781 ^ spoke the mute [man].
4784 ^ and marveled the crowds,
4788 ^ saying,
4789 ^ never was it seen thus in - israel.
4795 ^ the now
4797 ^ pharisees were saying,
4799 ^ by the prince of the demons he casts out - demons.
4807 ^ and was going throughout - jesus the cities all and the villages,
4817 ^ teaching in the synagogues of them,
4822 ^ and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom,
4828 ^ and healing every disease and every sickness.
4835 ^ having seen now the crowds, he was moved with compassion for them,
4842 ^ because they were
4844 ^ wearied
4845 ^ and cast away,
4847 ^ as sheep
4849 ^ not having a shepherd.
4852 ^ then he says to the disciples of him,
4857 ^ the indeed
4859 ^ harvest [is] plentiful,
4861 ^ the however
4863 ^ workmen [are] few;
4865 ^ beseech therefore the lord of the harvest,
4871 ^ that he might send out workmen into the harvest of him.
4878 ^ and
4879 ^ having summoned the twelve disciples of him, he gave to them authority over spirits unclean,
4889 ^ so as to cast out them
4892 ^ and to heal every disease and every sickness.
4899 ^ - and
4901 ^ of the twelve apostles the names are these:
4907 ^ first simon,
4909 ^ - called peter,
4912 ^ and andrew, the brother of him; and james the [son] of zebedee, and john the brother of him; philip, and bartholomew; thomas, and matthew the tax collector; james the [son] - of alphaeus, and thaddaeus; simon the zealot, and judas - iscariot,
4948 ^ the [one] also
4950 ^ having betrayed him.
4952 ^ these - twelve sent forth - jesus,
4958 ^ having instructed them,
4960 ^ saying,
4961 ^ into [the] way of the gentiles not go off,
4966 ^ and into any city of [the] samaritans not enter;
4972 ^ go however rather to those sheep
4978 ^ - being lost of [the] house of israel.
4982 ^ going on also proclaim,
4985 ^ saying
4986 ^ -, has drawn near the kingdom of the heavens.
5033 ^ into whatever now -
5037 ^ city or village you enter, inquire
5042 ^ who in it worthy is,
5047 ^ and there remain
5049 ^ until - you go forth.
5052 ^ entering now into the house, greet it.
5059 ^ and if indeed be the house worthy,
5066 ^ let come the peace of you upon it;
5072 ^ if however not it be worthy,
5077 ^ the peace of you to you let return.
5083 ^ and whoever - not will receive you,
5089 ^ nor will hear the words of you,
5094 ^ going forth out of the house or of the city that, shake off the dust of the feet of you!
5108 ^ truly i say to you,
5111 ^ more tolerable it will be
5113 ^ for [the] land of sodom and of gomorrah on day of judgment,
5120 ^ than the city for that.
5124 ^ behold,
5125 ^ i send forth you
5128 ^ as sheep in [the] midst of wolves;
5133 ^ be you therefore shrewd
5136 ^ as the serpents,
5139 ^ and innocent
5141 ^ as the doves.
5144 ^ beware however of - men;
5149 ^ they will deliver for you into courts,
5154 ^ and in the synagogues of them, they will flog you;
5161 ^ and before governors also,
5165 ^ and kings you will be brought, on account of me, for a testimony to them and to the gentiles.
5176 ^ when then they deliver up you,
5180 ^ not be anxious
5182 ^ how
5183 ^ or what you should speak;
5186 ^ it will be given for you in that - hour
5193 ^ what you should say.
5195 ^ not for you are
5199 ^ those speaking,
5201 ^ but the spirit of the father of you
5207 ^ - speaking through you.
5211 ^ will deliver up now brother, brother to death;
5217 ^ and father, child.
5220 ^ and will rise up children against parents,
5225 ^ and will put to death them.
5228 ^ and you will be
5230 ^ hated by all on account of the name of me;
5653 ^ having gone, relate to john
5656 ^ what you hear
5658 ^ and see:
5660 ^ blind receive sight,
5662 ^ and lame walk,
5665 ^ lepers are cleansed,
5667 ^ and deaf hear,
5670 ^ and dead are raised,
5673 ^ and poor are gospelized.
5676 ^ and blessed is
5679 ^ he who if not shall fall away in me.
5685 ^ as these now were going away,
5688 ^ began - jesus
5691 ^ to speak to the crowds concerning john:
5696 ^ what went you out into the wilderness to see?
5702 ^ a reed
5703 ^ by [the] wind shaken?
5706 ^ but
5707 ^ what did you go out to see?
5710 ^ a man
5711 ^ in delicate [clothing] having been dressed?
5714 ^ behold,
6309 ^ having gone out now, the pharisees a counsel held against him,
6317 ^ how him they might destroy.
6320 ^ - and
6322 ^ jesus,
6323 ^ having known, withdrew from there.
6326 ^ and followed him multitudes great,
6331 ^ and he healed them all,
6335 ^ and he warned them
6338 ^ that not known him they should make —
6343 ^ so that might be fulfilled
6345 ^ that having been spoken by isaiah the prophet,
6351 ^ saying,
6352 ^ behold
6353 ^ the servant of me,
6356 ^ whom i have chosen,
6358 ^ the beloved of me,
6361 ^ in whom has found delight the soul of me.
6367 ^ i will put the spirit of me upon him,
6373 ^ and justice to the gentiles he will proclaim.
6378 ^ not will he quarrel
6380 ^ nor will he cry out,
6382 ^ nor will hear anyone in the streets the voice of him.
6391 ^ a reed
6392 ^ bruised not he will break,
6395 ^ and a wick
6397 ^ smoldering not he will quench,
6400 ^ until - he leads to victory - justice.
6407 ^ and in the name of him [the] gentiles will hope.”
6413 ^ then was brought to him
6460 ^ having known now the thoughts of them, he said to them,
6467 ^ every kingdom
6469 ^ having been divided against itself is brought to desolation,
6473 ^ and every city or house
6478 ^ having been divided against itself not will stand.
6483 ^ and if - satan, - satan casts out,
6490 ^ against himself he is divided.
6493 ^ how then will stand the kingdom of him?
6499 ^ and if i by beelzebul cast out - demons,
6507 ^ the sons of you by whom do they cast out?
6513 ^ on account of this, they judges will be
6518 ^ of you.
6519 ^ if however by [the] spirit of god i cast out - demons,
6528 ^ then has come upon you the kingdom - of god.
6536 ^ or how is able anyone
6540 ^ to enter into the house of the strong [man]
6546 ^ and the goods of him to plunder,
6551 ^ if not first he bind the strong [man]?
6557 ^ and then the house of him he will plunder.
7083 ^ [the] sun now having risen, they were scorched,
7087 ^ and
7088 ^ through the not
7091 ^ having root, were dried up.
7094 ^ other now fell upon the thorns,
7100 ^ and grew up the thorns,
7104 ^ and choked them.
7107 ^ other now fell upon the soil - good,
7115 ^ and were yielding fruit,
7118 ^ some indeed a hundredfold,
7121 ^ some now sixty,
7124 ^ some now thirty.
7432 ^ in now
7434 ^ the [time] are sleeping the men, came his - enemy
7442 ^ and sowed weeds in [the] midst of the wheat,
7449 ^ and went away.
7451 ^ when now sprouted the plants
7456 ^ and fruit produced,
7459 ^ then appeared also the weeds.
7464 ^ having come to [him] now, the servants the master of the house said to him,
7472 ^ sir, not good seed did you sow in - your field?
7481 ^ how then has it the weeds?
7485 ^ - and he said to them,
7489 ^ an enemy, a man this did.
7493 ^ - and
7495 ^ the servants said, to him
7498 ^ do you desire then
7500 ^ [that] having gone forth, we should gather them?
7503 ^ - and he said,
7506 ^ no;
7507 ^ not lest
7508 ^ gathering the weeds, you would uproot with them the wheat.
7516 ^ allow
7517 ^ to grow together both until the harvest;
7522 ^ and in the time of the harvest i will say to the harvesters,
7530 ^ gather first the weeds,
7534 ^ and bind them into bundles
7539 ^ in order - to burn them;
7543 ^ - and
7545 ^ the wheat, gather together into the barn of me.”’
7551 ^ another parable put he before them,
7555 ^ saying,
7556 ^ like is the kingdom of the heavens
7562 ^ to a grain of mustard,
7564 ^ which having taken, a man sowed in the field of him;
7572 ^ which smallest indeed is
7576 ^ of all the seeds;
7579 ^ when however it is grown,
7582 ^ greater than the garden plants it is,
7586 ^ and becomes a tree,
7589 ^ so that come the birds of the air
7595 ^ and perch in the branches of it.
7601 ^ another parable spoke he to them:
7605 ^ like is the kingdom of the heavens
7611 ^ to leaven,
7612 ^ which having taken, a woman hid in of flour measures three,
7620 ^ until of it was leavened all.
7624 ^ these things all spoke - jesus in parables to the crowds,
7633 ^ and without a parable not he was speaking to them,
7639 ^ so that might be fulfilled
7641 ^ that having been spoken by the prophet,
7646 ^ saying,
7647 ^ i will open in parables the mouth of me;
7653 ^ i will utter
7654 ^ things hidden from [the] foundation [of the] world.”
7658 ^ then
7659 ^ having dismissed the crowds, he went into the house.
7666 ^ and came to him the disciples of him,
7672 ^ saying,
7673 ^ explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.
7681 ^ - and
7683 ^ answering he said,
7821 ^ which, having found, a man hid,
7825 ^ and for the joy of it goes
7831 ^ and he sells all
7834 ^ that he has
7836 ^ and buys the field that.
7841 ^ again like is the kingdom of the heavens
7848 ^ a man, a merchant
7850 ^ seeking fine pearls;
7853 ^ having found now one very precious pearl,
7858 ^ having gone away, he has sold all things
7861 ^ as many as he had,
7863 ^ and bought it.
7866 ^ again like is the kingdom of the heavens
7873 ^ a dragnet
7874 ^ having been cast into the sea,
7878 ^ and of every kind having gathered together,
7883 ^ which,
7884 ^ when it was filled, having drawn up on the shore
7890 ^ and having sat down, they collected the good into vessels,
7897 ^ the and
7899 ^ bad out they cast.
7902 ^ thus will it be in the consummation of the age;
7909 ^ will go out the angels,
7912 ^ and will separate the evil from [the] midst of the righteous,
7920 ^ and will cast them into the furnace of the fire.
7928 ^ there will be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.
7937 ^ have you understood these things all?
7940 ^ they say to him,
7942 ^ yes.
7943 ^ - and he said to them,
7947 ^ because of this, every scribe
7951 ^ having been discipled into the kingdom of the heavens like is
7958 ^ a man, a master of a house,
7960 ^ who puts forth out of the treasure of him [things] new and old.
7969 ^ and it came to pass,
7971 ^ when had finished - jesus the parables these,
7978 ^ he withdrew from there.
7980 ^ and
7981 ^ having come into the region his [own], he was teaching them in the synagogue of them,
7992 ^ so that are astonished they
7995 ^ and are saying,
7997 ^ from where to this [man] the wisdom this and the miraculous powers?
8005 ^ not this is the of the carpenter son?
8012 ^ [is] not the mother of him called mary?
8018 ^ and the brothers of him james and joseph and simon and judas?
8029 ^ and the sisters of him
8033 ^ not all with us are?
8038 ^ from where then to this [man] these things all?
8043 ^ and they were offended at him.
8047 ^ - but
8049 ^ jesus said to them,
8052 ^ not is a prophet without honor,
8056 ^ if not in the hometown, and in the household of him.
8066 ^ and not he did there miracles many, because of the unbelief of them.
8076 ^ at that - time heard herod the tetrarch the news of jesus,
8087 ^ and he said to [the] servants of him,
8092 ^ this is john the baptist;
8097 ^ he is risen from the dead,
8102 ^ and because of this, the miraculous powers are working in him.
8110 ^ - for
8112 ^ herod
8113 ^ having seized - john, he bound him
8118 ^ and in prison put [him], on account of herodias, the wife of philip, the brother of him.
8130 ^ had been saying for - john to him,
8135 ^ not it is lawful for you
8138 ^ to have her.
8140 ^ although
8141 ^ wishing
8142 ^ him to kill, he feared the multitude,
8147 ^ because as a prophet him they were holding.
8152 ^ [the] birthday now having been celebrated
8155 ^ - of herod,
8157 ^ danced the daughter - of herodias in the midst,
8165 ^ and pleased - herod,
8169 ^ whereupon with oath he promised
8173 ^ to her to give
8175 ^ whatever if she should ask.
8178 ^ - and
8180 ^ having been urged on by the mother of her,
8185 ^ give me, she says,
8188 ^ here upon a platter the head of john the baptist.
8196 ^ and
8197 ^ having been grieved the king, on account of the oaths
8203 ^ and those reclining with [him], he commanded [it]
8207 ^ to be given.
8208 ^ and
8209 ^ he having sent, beheaded - john in the prison.
8216 ^ and was brought the head of him on a platter,
8223 ^ and was given to the girl,
8227 ^ and she brought [it] to [the] mother of her.
8232 ^ and
8233 ^ having come, the disciples of him took the body,
8240 ^ and buried it;
8243 ^ and
8244 ^ having come, they told - jesus.
8248 ^ having heard now, - jesus withdrew from there by boat to a secluded place apart himself.
8261 ^ and
8262 ^ having heard [of it], the crowds followed him on foot from the towns.
8271 ^ and
8272 ^ having gone out, he saw great a crowd,
8276 ^ and was moved with compassion toward them,
8280 ^ and healed the sick of them.
8285 ^ evening now having come,
8288 ^ came to him the disciples,
8292 ^ saying,
8293 ^ desolate is this place,
8297 ^ and the time already is gone by.
8302 ^ dismiss the crowds,
8305 ^ that
8306 ^ having gone into the villages, they might buy for themselves food.
8313 ^ - and
8315 ^ jesus said to them,
8318 ^ no need they have
8504 ^ answering now to him, - peter said,
8510 ^ lord, if you [it] is,
8514 ^ command me
8516 ^ to come to you upon the waters.
8522 ^ - and he said,
8525 ^ come.
8526 ^ and
8527 ^ having descended from the boat, - peter walked upon the water
8537 ^ and came to - jesus.
8542 ^ seeing now the wind charging, he was afraid,
8548 ^ and
8549 ^ having begun
8550 ^ to sink, he cried out,
8552 ^ saying,
8553 ^ lord, save me!
8556 ^ immediately now - jesus,
8560 ^ having stretched out the hand, took hold of him
8565 ^ and says to him,
8568 ^ [you] of little faith, of why did you doubt?
8572 ^ and having entered they into the boat,
8578 ^ ceased the wind.
8581 ^ those then
8583 ^ in the boat worshiped him,
8588 ^ saying,
8589 ^ truly, of god son you are!
8593 ^ and
8594 ^ having crossed over, they came to the land of gennesaret.
8601 ^ and
8602 ^ having recognized him, the men the place of that sent to all the surrounding region that
8615 ^ and brought to him all
8619 ^ those sick
8621 ^ being,
8622 ^ and they were begging him
8625 ^ that only they might touch the fringe of the garment of him;
8633 ^ and
8634 ^ as many as touched were cured.
8637 ^ then come - to jesus from jerusalem pharisees and scribes,
8646 ^ saying,
8647 ^ because of why the disciples of you break the tradition of the elders?
8657 ^ not for they wash the hands of them
8663 ^ when bread they shall eat.
8666 ^ - and
8668 ^ answering he said to them,
8671 ^ because of why also you break the commandment - of god on account of the tradition of you?
8684 ^ - for
8686 ^ god commanded,
8688 ^ honor the father and the mother’
8694 ^ and,
8695 ^ the [one] speaking evil of father or mother, in death must end.’
8702 ^ you however say,
8705 ^ whoever - shall say to the father or the mother,
8713 ^ [it is] a gift,
8714 ^ whatever if by me you might be profited,
8719 ^ no not he shall honor the father of himself.
8725 ^ and you made void the commandment - of god on account of the tradition of you!
8735 ^ hypocrites! rightly prophesied concerning you isaiah,
8741 ^ saying,
8742 ^ the people this, with the lips me it honors;
8749 ^ the however
8751 ^ heart of them, far away is kept from me;
8757 ^ in vain then they worship me,
8761 ^ teaching [as] doctrines [the] precepts of men.’
8765 ^ and
8766 ^ having called to [him] the crowd, he said to them,
8771 ^ hear
8772 ^ and understand!
8774 ^ not
8775 ^ what is entering into the mouth defiles the man;
8783 ^ but
8784 ^ that going forth out of the mouth,
8789 ^ this defiles the man.
8793 ^ then
8794 ^ having come near, the disciples said to him,
8799 ^ know you
8800 ^ that the pharisees,
8803 ^ having heard the saying, were offended?
8807 ^ - and
8809 ^ answering he said,
8811 ^ every plant
8813 ^ that not has planted the father of me - heavenly, it will be rooted up.
8822 ^ leave them!
8824 ^ blind they are
8826 ^ guides of the blind.
8828 ^ blind now blind if they lead,
8833 ^ both into a pit will fall.
8837 ^ answering then, - peter said to him,
8843 ^ explain to us the parable this.
8848 ^ - and he said,
8851 ^ still also you without understanding are?
8856 ^ not yet understand you
8858 ^ that everything
8860 ^ - entering into the mouth, into the stomach goes,
8869 ^ and into [the] sewer is cast out?
9352 ^ having known [this] however, - jesus said,
9357 ^ why reason you among yourselves, o [you] of little faith,
9362 ^ because bread not you took?
9366 ^ not yet do you understand,
9368 ^ nor remember the five loaves for the five thousand,
9375 ^ and how many hand-baskets you gathered?
9379 ^ nor the seven loaves for the four thousand,
9385 ^ and how many baskets you gathered?
9389 ^ how not understand you
9392 ^ that, not concerning bread i spoke to you,
9398 ^ to beware also of the leaven of the pharisees and sadducees?
9407 ^ then they understood
9409 ^ that not he said
9412 ^ to beware of the leaven of bread,
9418 ^ but
9419 ^ of the teaching of the pharisees and sadducees.
9426 ^ having come then - jesus into the district of caesarea - philippi, he was questioning the disciples of him,
9440 ^ saying,
9476 ^ answering now, simon peter said,
9481 ^ you are the christ, the son of god
9489 ^ the living.
9491 ^ answering now, - jesus said to him,
9497 ^ blessed are you, simon barjona!
9501 ^ for flesh and blood not revealed [it] to you,
9508 ^ but the father of me, who [is] in the heavens.
9516 ^ i also now to you say
9520 ^ that you are peter,
9524 ^ and on this the rock i will build my - church,
9533 ^ and [the] gates of hades not will prevail against it.
9539 ^ i will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens;
9547 ^ and
9548 ^ whatever if you might bind on the earth, will be
9555 ^ bound in the heavens;
9559 ^ and
9560 ^ whatever if you might loose on the earth, will be
9567 ^ loosed in the heavens.
9571 ^ then instructed he the disciples
9575 ^ that to no one they should say
9578 ^ that he is the christ.
9583 ^ from that time began - jesus
9588 ^ to show to the disciples of him
9592 ^ that it is necessary for
9594 ^ him to jerusalem to go away,
9598 ^ and many things to suffer from the elders and chief priests and scribes,
9608 ^ and to be killed,
9610 ^ and on the third day to be raised.
9615 ^ and
9616 ^ having taken aside him, - peter began
9621 ^ to rebuke him,
9623 ^ saying,
9624 ^ far be it from you, lord;
9627 ^ never, not will be to you this.
9632 ^ - and
9634 ^ having turned he said - to peter,
9638 ^ get behind me, satan!
9642 ^ a stumbling block you are
9644 ^ to me.
9645 ^ for not your thoughts are of the things - of god,
9651 ^ but the things of men.
9655 ^ then - jesus said to disciples of him,
9662 ^ if anyone desires
9665 ^ after me to come,
9668 ^ let him deny himself,
9670 ^ and take up the cross of him,
9675 ^ and follow me.
9827 ^ answering now, - peter said - to jesus,
9834 ^ lord, good it is
9837 ^ for us here to be.
9840 ^ if you wish,
9842 ^ i will make here three tabernacles,
9846 ^ for you one, and for moses one, and for elijah one.
9854 ^ while yet he was speaking,
9857 ^ behold,
9858 ^ a cloud bright overshadowed them;
9862 ^ and behold,
9864 ^ a voice out of the cloud,
9868 ^ saying,
9869 ^ this is the son of me, the beloved,
9876 ^ in whom i am well pleased.
9879 ^ listen to him!
9881 ^ and
9882 ^ having heard [it], the disciples fell upon face of them
9889 ^ and were terrified greatly.
9892 ^ and having come to [them] - jesus,
9896 ^ and having touched them,
9899 ^ he said,
9900 ^ rise up,
9901 ^ and not be afraid.
9904 ^ having lifted up and the eyes of them, no one they saw
9911 ^ if not himself jesus alone.
9916 ^ and [as] were descending they from the mountain,
9922 ^ instructed them - jesus,
9926 ^ saying,
9927 ^ to no one tell the vision,
9931 ^ until that the son - of man out from [the] dead is risen.
9940 ^ and asked him the disciples,
9945 ^ saying,
9946 ^ why then the scribes say
9951 ^ that
9952 ^ elijah it behooves to come first?
9956 ^ - and
9958 ^ answering, he said,
9960 ^ elijah indeed comes,
9963 ^ and will restore all things.
9966 ^ i say however to you
9969 ^ that elijah already is come,
9973 ^ and not they knew him,
9977 ^ but did to him
9981 ^ whatever they desired.
9983 ^ thus also, the son - of man is about
9990 ^ to suffer from them.
9993 ^ then understood the disciples
9997 ^ that concerning john the baptist he spoke to them.
10004 ^ and they having come to the crowd,
10009 ^ came to him a man
10012 ^ kneeling down to him
10014 ^ and saying,
10016 ^ lord, have mercy on my - son,
10021 ^ for he is epileptic
10023 ^ and miserably suffers;
10026 ^ often for he falls into the fire,
10032 ^ and often into the water.
10037 ^ and i brought him to the disciples of you,
10043 ^ and not they were able
10046 ^ him to heal.
10048 ^ answering now, - jesus said,
10053 ^ o generation unbelieving
10056 ^ and perverted, how long when with you will i be?
10063 ^ how long when will i bear with you?
10067 ^ bring to me him here.
10071 ^ and rebuked him - jesus,
10076 ^ and went out from him the demon,
10082 ^ and was healed the boy from the hour that.
10090 ^ then
10091 ^ having come the disciples - to jesus in private, they said,
10099 ^ because of why we not were able
10104 ^ to cast out it?
10106 ^ - and he said to them,
10110 ^ because of the little faith of you.
10114 ^ truly for i say to you,
10118 ^ if you have faith as a seed of mustard,
10124 ^ you will say to the mountain to this,
10128 ^ move from here to there,
10131 ^ and it will move.
10133 ^ and nothing will be impossible for you.”
10137 ^ were abiding now they in - galilee,
10143 ^ said to them - jesus,
10147 ^ is about the son - of man
10152 ^ to be betrayed into [the] hands of men,
10156 ^ and they will kill him,
10159 ^ and on the third day he will be raised up.
10164 ^ and they were grieved deeply.
10167 ^ having come now they to capernaum,
10172 ^ came
10173 ^ those the didrachmas
10176 ^ collecting - to peter
10179 ^ and said,
10181 ^ the teacher of you not does he pay the didrachmas?
10188 ^ he says,
10189 ^ yes.
10190 ^ and he having entered into the house,
10195 ^ anticipated him - jesus,
10199 ^ saying,
10200 ^ what you do think, simon?
10204 ^ the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive custom or tribute?
10214 ^ from the sons of them,
10218 ^ or from - strangers?
10222 ^ he having said now,
10224 ^ from the strangers,
10227 ^ said to him - jesus,
10231 ^ then free are the sons.
10236 ^ that however not we might offend them,
10241 ^ having gone to sea, cast a hook,
10246 ^ and the
10248 ^ having come up first fish take,
10252 ^ and
10253 ^ having opened the mouth of it, you will find a four-drachma coin.
10259 ^ that having taken, give to them for me and yourself.
10267 ^ in that - hour came the disciples - to jesus,
10276 ^ saying,
10277 ^ who then [the] greatest is in the kingdom of the heavens?
10286 ^ and
10287 ^ having called to [him] a child, he set it in midst of them,
10294 ^ and said,
10296 ^ truly i say to you,
10299 ^ if not you turn
10302 ^ and become as the little children,
10307 ^ no not shall you enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
10315 ^ whoever therefore will humble himself as the little child this,
10323 ^ he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens.
10332 ^ and
10333 ^ whoever if shall receive one little child such in the name of me, me receives.
10345 ^ whoever then - shall cause to stumble one of the little ones of these
10353 ^ - believing in me,
10357 ^ it is better for him
10359 ^ that should be hung a millstone heavy around the neck of him,
10367 ^ and he be sunk in the depth of the sea.
10374 ^ woe to the world because of the causes of sin.
10380 ^ necessary [are] for
10382 ^ to come the stumbling blocks,
10385 ^ but woe to the man
10389 ^ by whom the offense comes!
10394 ^ if now the hand of you or the foot of you causes to sin you,
10405 ^ cut off it
10407 ^ and cast [it] from you;
10411 ^ better for you it is
10414 ^ to enter into - life crippled or lame,
10421 ^ than
10422 ^ two hands or two feet having, to be cast into the fire - eternal.
10434 ^ and if the eye of you causes to sin you,
10441 ^ gouge out it
10443 ^ and cast [it] from you;
10447 ^ better for you it is
10450 ^ one-eyed into - life to enter,
10455 ^ than
10456 ^ two eyes having to be cast into the hell of the fire.
10465 ^ see [that]
10466 ^ not you despise one of the little ones of these.
10472 ^ i say for to you
10475 ^ that the angels of them in [the] heavens continually always behold the face of the father of me, who [is] in [the] heavens.
10492 ^ what you do think?
10495 ^ if there should be to any man a hundred sheep,
10501 ^ and has gone astray one of them,
10506 ^ not will he leave the ninety nine on the mountains,
10514 ^ and
10515 ^ having gone, seek
10517 ^ the [one] going astray?
10519 ^ and if he should
10522 ^ find it,
10524 ^ truly i say to you
10527 ^ that he rejoices over it
10531 ^ more than over the ninety nine
10537 ^ - not
10539 ^ having gone astray.
10540 ^ thus not it is [the] will of the father of you who [is] in [the] heavens,
10551 ^ that should perish one of the little ones of these.
10557 ^ if now sins against you the brother of you,
10565 ^ go
10566 ^ reprove him, between you and him alone.
10573 ^ if you he will hear,
10576 ^ you have gained the brother of you.
10580 ^ if however not he will hear,
10584 ^ take with you more, one or two,
10591 ^ that upon [the] testimony of two witnesses or of three, may be strengthened every word.’
10601 ^ if now he fails to listen to them,
10605 ^ tell [it] to the church.
10608 ^ if now also to the church he fails to listen,
10614 ^ let him be to you as the pagan and the tax collector.
10622 ^ truly i say to you,
10771 ^ having fallen down therefore the servant was bowing on his knees to him,
10777 ^ saying,
10778 ^ have patience with me,
10781 ^ and all i will pay to you.
10785 ^ having been moved with compassion now, the master of the servant that released him,
10794 ^ and the debt forgave him.
10799 ^ having gone out however, the servant same found one the fellow servants of him
10809 ^ who was owing him a hundred denarii,
10814 ^ and
10815 ^ having seized him he was throttling [him],
10818 ^ saying,
10819 ^ pay
10820 ^ if any you owe.’
10823 ^ having fallen down therefore, the fellow servant of him was begging him,
10830 ^ saying,
10831 ^ have patience with me,
10834 ^ and i will pay you.
10837 ^ - but not he was willing,
10841 ^ rather
10842 ^ having gone, he cast him into prison,
10847 ^ until he should pay
10849 ^ that which was owing.
10851 ^ having seen therefore the fellow servants of him
11299 ^ having heard now the young man the statement, he went away
11306 ^ grieving;
11307 ^ he was [one] for
11309 ^ having possessions many.
11312 ^ - and
11314 ^ jesus said to the disciples of him,
11319 ^ truly i say to you
11322 ^ that a rich man with difficulty will enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
11331 ^ again now i say to you,
11335 ^ easier for [it] is
11337 ^ a camel through [the] eye of a needle to go,
11342 ^ than
11343 ^ a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god.
11350 ^ having heard now, the disciples were astonished exceedingly,
11356 ^ saying,
11357 ^ who then is able
11360 ^ to be saved?
11361 ^ having looked on [them] now, - jesus said to them,
11367 ^ with men this impossible is,
11372 ^ with however
11374 ^ god all things [are] possible.
11377 ^ then
11378 ^ answering - peter said to him,
11383 ^ behold,
11384 ^ we left all things
11387 ^ and followed you;
11390 ^ what then will be to us?
11394 ^ - and
11396 ^ jesus said to them,
11399 ^ truly i say to you
11402 ^ that you
11404 ^ - having followed me,
11407 ^ in the regeneration,
11410 ^ when shall sit down the son - of man upon [the] throne of glory of him, will sit also you on twelve thrones,
11426 ^ judging the twelve tribes - of israel.
11432 ^ and everyone
11434 ^ who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for the sake of - name, my a hundredfold will receive,
11455 ^ and life eternal will inherit.
11459 ^ many however will be
11462 ^ first last,
11464 ^ and last first.
11467 ^ like for is the kingdom of the heavens
11474 ^ to a man, a master of a house,
11476 ^ who went out in [the] morning
11480 ^ to hire workmen for the vineyard of him.
11486 ^ having agreed then with the workmen for a denarius for the day, he sent them into the vineyard of him.
11501 ^ and
11502 ^ having gone out about the third hour, he saw others
11508 ^ standing in the marketplace idle,
11513 ^ and to them he said,
11516 ^ go also you into the vineyard,
11522 ^ and
11523 ^ whatever if might be right, i will give you.
11529 ^ - and they went.
11532 ^ again then
11534 ^ having gone out about [the] sixth and ninth hour, he did likewise.
11542 ^ about then
11544 ^ the eleventh,
11546 ^ having gone out, he found others
11549 ^ standing,
11550 ^ and he says to them,
11553 ^ why here stand you all the day idle?
11560 ^ they say to him,
11562 ^ because no one us has hired.
11566 ^ he says to them,
11568 ^ go also you into the vineyard.’
11574 ^ evening then having arrived,
11577 ^ says the master of the vineyard to foreman of him,
11585 ^ call the workmen
11588 ^ and pay them the wages,
11593 ^ having begun from the last unto the first.
11600 ^ and having come those [hired] about the eleventh hour, they received each a denarius.
11610 ^ and
11611 ^ having come the first, they thought
11615 ^ that more they will receive,
11618 ^ but they received those each a denarius
11623 ^ also themselves.
11625 ^ having received, now they were grumbling against the master of the house,
11631 ^ saying,
11632 ^ these the last, one hour have worked,
11638 ^ and equal to us them you have made,
11643 ^ those having borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.
11652 ^ - and
11654 ^ answering to one of them, he said,
11658 ^ friend, not i do wrong you.
11662 ^ not for a denarius did you agree with me?
11666 ^ take what [is] yours
11669 ^ and go.
11671 ^ i desire now
11673 ^ to this - last to give,
11677 ^ as also to you.
11680 ^ or not is it lawful for me
11809 ^ answering now, - jesus said,
11814 ^ not you know
11816 ^ what you ask for.
11818 ^ are you able
11819 ^ to drink the cup
11822 ^ which i am about
11825 ^ to drink?”
11826 ^ they say to him,
11828 ^ we are able.
11829 ^ he says to them,
11831 ^ - indeed
11833 ^ the cup of me you will drink,
11995 ^ having been moved with compassion then, - jesus touched the eyes of them;
12003 ^ and immediately they received sight,
12006 ^ and they followed him.
12009 ^ and when they drew near to jerusalem
12014 ^ and came to bethphage on the mount - of olives,
12023 ^ then jesus sent two disciples,
12028 ^ saying to them,
12030 ^ go into the village - in front of you,
12037 ^ and immediately you will find a donkey
12041 ^ having been tied, and a colt with her;
12046 ^ having untied [them], bring [them] to me.
12049 ^ and if anyone to you says anything,
12055 ^ you will say
12056 ^ that the lord of them need has.
12062 ^ immediately then he will send them.
12066 ^ this then came to pass
12069 ^ that it might be fulfilled
12071 ^ that having been spoken by the prophet,
12076 ^ saying,
12077 ^ say to the daughter of zion,
12081 ^ behold,
12082 ^ the king of you comes to you, gentle and
12089 ^ mounted on a donkey, even upon a colt, [the] foal of a beast of burden.’”
12097 ^ having gone then the disciples
12101 ^ and having done
12103 ^ as commanded them - jesus,
12108 ^ they brought the donkey and the colt,
12114 ^ and put upon them their cloaks,
12120 ^ and he sat on them.
12124 ^ the now
12126 ^ very great crowd spread their the cloaks on the road;
12135 ^ others now were cutting down branches from the trees
12142 ^ and were spreading [them] on the road.
12147 ^ the now
12149 ^ crowds
12150 ^ - going before him
12153 ^ and those following were crying out,
12157 ^ saying:
12158 ^ hosanna to the son of david!”
12256 ^ having seen now the chief priests and the scribes the wonders
12265 ^ that he did and the children
12270 ^ the crying out in the temple
12275 ^ and saying,
12277 ^ hosanna to the son of david, they were indignant
12282 ^ and said to him,
12285 ^ hear you
12286 ^ what these say?
12289 ^ - and
12291 ^ jesus says to them,
12294 ^ yes,
12295 ^ never did you read
12297 ^ -: out of [the] mouth of babes
12301 ^ and sucklings, you have prepared for yourself praise’
12305 ^ and
12306 ^ having left them, he went out of the city to bethany,
12314 ^ and he passed the night there.
12317 ^ in the morning then,
12319 ^ having come back into the city, he became hungry.
12324 ^ and
12325 ^ having seen fig tree one along the road, he came to it
12334 ^ and nothing found on it,
12339 ^ if not leaves only.
12343 ^ and he says to it,
12346 ^ no more from you fruit let there be, to the age.
12354 ^ and withered immediately the fig tree.
12359 ^ and
12360 ^ having seen [it], the disciples marveled,
12364 ^ saying,
12365 ^ how so quickly withered the fig tree?
12370 ^ answering now, - jesus said to them,
12376 ^ truly i say to you,
12379 ^ if you have faith
12382 ^ and not do doubt,
12385 ^ not only the [miracle] of the fig tree will you do,
12391 ^ but even if to the mountain this you should say,
12397 ^ be you taken away
12398 ^ and be you cast into the sea,
12403 ^ it will come to pass.
12404 ^ and all things
12406 ^ as many as - you might ask in - prayer,
12412 ^ believing, you will receive.
12414 ^ and having come of him into the temple,
12420 ^ came to him
12422 ^ teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people,
12430 ^ saying,
12431 ^ by what authority these things are you doing?
12436 ^ and who to you gave the authority this?
12443 ^ answering now, - jesus said to them,
12449 ^ will ask you i also thing one,
12454 ^ which if you tell me,
12458 ^ i also to you will say
12461 ^ by what authority these things i do.
12466 ^ the baptism of john, from where was it?
12472 ^ from heaven,
12474 ^ or from men?
12477 ^ - and they were reasoning with themselves,
12482 ^ saying,
12483 ^ if we should say,
12485 ^ from heaven,
12487 ^ he will say to us,
12489 ^ because of why then not did you believe him?
12495 ^ if however we should say,
12498 ^ from men,
12500 ^ we fear the multitude;
12503 ^ all for as a prophet hold - john.
12510 ^ and
12511 ^ answering - jesus, they said,
12515 ^ not do we know.
12517 ^ said to them also he,
12521 ^ neither i tell you
12525 ^ by what authority these things i do.
12530 ^ what however you think?
12534 ^ a man had sons two,
12538 ^ and
12539 ^ having come to the first he said,
12543 ^ son, go today,
12546 ^ work in the vineyard.
12550 ^ - and
12552 ^ answering he said,
12554 ^ not will i.
12556 ^ afterward however,
12558 ^ having repented, he went.
12560 ^ having come then to the other, he said likewise.
12566 ^ - and
12568 ^ answering he said,
12570 ^ i [will] sir,
12572 ^ and not did he go.
12575 ^ which of the two did the will of the father?
12584 ^ they say,
12585 ^ the first.
12587 ^ says to them - jesus,
12591 ^ truly i say to you
12594 ^ that the tax collectors and the prostitutes go before you into the kingdom - of god.
12607 ^ came for john to you in [the] way of righteousness,
12615 ^ and not you did believe him,
12619 ^ - however
12621 ^ the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him;
12627 ^ you then,
12629 ^ having seen, not even did repent afterward
12633 ^ - to believe him.
12636 ^ another parable hear:
12639 ^ a man there was,
12641 ^ a master of a house,
12642 ^ who planted a vineyard,
12645 ^ and a fence it placed around,
12649 ^ and dug in it a winepress,
12654 ^ and built a tower,
12657 ^ and rented out it to farmers,
12661 ^ and traveled abroad.
12663 ^ when then drew near the season of the fruits,
12670 ^ he sent the servants of him to the farmers
12677 ^ to receive the fruits of him.
12681 ^ and
12682 ^ having taken the farmers the servants of him, one - they beat,
12691 ^ one then they killed,
12694 ^ one then they stoned.
12697 ^ again he sent other servants, more than the first,
12704 ^ and they did to them likewise.
12708 ^ afterward then, he sent to them the son of him,
12716 ^ saying,
12717 ^ they will respect the son of me.
12721 ^ - but
12723 ^ the farmers
12724 ^ having seen the son, said among themselves,
12730 ^ this is the heir;
12734 ^ come,
12735 ^ let us kill him
12737 ^ and gain possession of the inheritance of him.
12742 ^ and
12743 ^ having taking him, they cast [him] out of the vineyard
12749 ^ and killed [him].
12751 ^ when therefore shall come the master of the vineyard,
12758 ^ what will he do the farmers to those?
12763 ^ they say to him,
12765 ^ [the] wretches, grievously he will destroy
12768 ^ them,
12769 ^ and the vineyard he will rent out to other farmers,
12775 ^ who will give to him the fruits in the seasons of them.
12784 ^ says to them - jesus,
12788 ^ never did you read in the scriptures:
12793 ^ [the] stone
12794 ^ which rejected
12796 ^ those building,
12798 ^ this has become the chief corner.
12803 ^ from [the] lord was this,
12807 ^ and it is marvelous in [the] eyes of us?’
12813 ^ because of this i say to you
12817 ^ that will be taken away from you the kingdom - of god,
12825 ^ and it will be given to a people
12828 ^ producing the fruits of it.
12832 ^ and
12833 ^ the [one] having fallen on the stone this will be broken;
12840 ^ on whomever but - it shall fall,
12845 ^ it will grind to powder him.
12847 ^ and
12848 ^ having heard the chief priests and the pharisees the parables of him, they knew
12858 ^ that about them he speaks.
12862 ^ and
12863 ^ seeking
12864 ^ him to lay hold of, they feared the crowds,
12869 ^ because as a prophet him they were holding.
12874 ^ and
12875 ^ answering, - jesus again spoke in parables to them,
12883 ^ saying,
12884 ^ has become like the kingdom of the heavens to a man, a king,
12891 ^ who made a wedding feast for the son of him.
12897 ^ and he sent the servants of him
12902 ^ to call
12903 ^ those having been invited to the wedding feast,
12908 ^ and not they were willing
12911 ^ to come.
12912 ^ again he sent other servants,
12916 ^ saying,
12917 ^ say
12918 ^ to those having been invited,
12920 ^ behold,
12921 ^ the dinner of me i have prepared,
12925 ^ the oxen of me and the fatlings
12931 ^ have been killed,
12932 ^ and all things [are] ready;
12935 ^ come to the wedding feast.
12939 ^ - and
12941 ^ having paid no attention they went away,
12943 ^ one - to the own field,
12949 ^ one then to the business of him.
12955 ^ - and
12957 ^ the rest,
12958 ^ having laid hold of the servants of him, mistreated
12963 ^ and killed [them].
12965 ^ - and
12967 ^ the king was angry,
12969 ^ and
12970 ^ having sent the armies of him, he destroyed the murderers those,
12978 ^ and the city of them he burned.
12983 ^ then he says to servants of him,
12988 ^ the indeed
12990 ^ wedding feast ready is;
13035 ^ having entered in then the king
13039 ^ to see
13040 ^ those reclining, he beheld there a man
13045 ^ not being dressed in clothes of wedding;
13049 ^ and he says to him,
13052 ^ friend, how did you enter here
13056 ^ not having garment of wedding?
13060 ^ - and he was speechless.
13063 ^ then the king said to the servants,
13069 ^ having bound his feet and hands, cast out him into the darkness - outer;
13081 ^ there will be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.
13090 ^ many for are called,
13094 ^ few however chosen.
13097 ^ then
13098 ^ having gone out, the pharisees counsel took
13103 ^ how him they might trap in his words.
13108 ^ and they send to him the disciples of them, with the herodians,
13117 ^ saying,
13118 ^ teacher, we know
13120 ^ that true you are,
13123 ^ and the way - of god in [the] truth you teach,
13131 ^ and not there is care to you about no one,
13137 ^ not for you look on [the] appearance of men.
13143 ^ tell therefore us
13146 ^ what you think?
13149 ^ is it lawful
13150 ^ to give tribute to caesar,
13153 ^ or not?
13155 ^ having known however - jesus the malice of them, he said,
13163 ^ why me do you test, hypocrites?
13167 ^ show me the coin of the tribute.
13173 ^ - and they presented to him a denarius.
13178 ^ and he says to them,
13181 ^ whose [is] the likeness this?
13185 ^ and whose inscription?
13188 ^ they say to him
13190 ^ caesar’s.
13191 ^ then he says to them,
13194 ^ give back therefore the things of caesar to caesar,
13199 ^ and the things - of god - to god.
13205 ^ and
13206 ^ having heard, they marveled;
13208 ^ and
13209 ^ having left him, they went away. on that - day
13216 ^ came to him sadducees,
13219 ^ those saying
13220 ^ not there is a resurrection,
13223 ^ and they questioned him,
13226 ^ saying,
13227 ^ teacher, moses said,
13230 ^ if anyone should die
13233 ^ not having children,
13236 ^ will marry the brother of him the wife of him,
13243 ^ and he will raise up offspring for the brother of him.
13249 ^ there were now among us seven brothers;
13255 ^ and the first,
13258 ^ having married, died,
13260 ^ and
13261 ^ not having seed, he left the wife of him to the brother of him.
13271 ^ likewise also the second,
13275 ^ and the third,
13278 ^ unto the seventh.
13281 ^ last then
13283 ^ of all, died the woman.
13287 ^ in the resurrection, therefore, of which of the seven will she be
13295 ^ wife?
13296 ^ all for had her.
13300 ^ answering now, - jesus said to them,
13306 ^ you err,
13307 ^ not knowing the scriptures,
13311 ^ nor the power - of god.
13316 ^ in for
13318 ^ the resurrection, neither do they marry,
13322 ^ nor are given in marriage,
13324 ^ but like angels in - heaven they are.
13331 ^ concerning now
13333 ^ the resurrection of the dead, not have you read
13339 ^ that which has been spoken to you by - god,
13345 ^ saying,
13346 ^ i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob?’
13359 ^ not he is the god of [the] dead,
13364 ^ but
13365 ^ of [the] living.
13366 ^ and
13367 ^ having heard, the crowds were astonished at the teaching of him.
13375 ^ - and
13377 ^ the pharisees,
13378 ^ having heard
13379 ^ that he had silenced the sadducees, were gathered together the same.
13387 ^ and questioned [him] one of them, a lawyer,
13393 ^ testing him,
13395 ^ teacher, which commandment [is the] greatest in the law?
13402 ^ - and he said to him,
13406 ^ you shall love [the] lord the god of you with all the heart of you, and with all the soul of you, and with all the mind of you.’
13428 ^ this is the great and first commandment.
13435 ^ [the] second also [is] like it:
13439 ^ you shall love the neighbor of you
13443 ^ as yourself.’
13445 ^ on these - two commandments, all the law hangs
13454 ^ and the prophets.
13457 ^ having been assembled together now the pharisees,
13461 ^ questioned them - jesus,
13465 ^ saying,
13466 ^ what you think concerning the christ?
13472 ^ of whom son is he?
13475 ^ they say to him,
13477 ^ - of david.
13479 ^ he says to them,
13481 ^ how then, david in spirit does call him lord,
13489 ^ saying:
13490 ^ said the lord to the lord of me,
13495 ^ sit on [the] right hand of me,
13499 ^ until - i place the enemies of you [as] a footstool for the feet of you.”’
13509 ^ if therefore david calls him lord,
13515 ^ how son of him is he?
13519 ^ and no one was able
13522 ^ to answer him a word,
13525 ^ nor dared anyone from that - day
13532 ^ to question him no longer.
13535 ^ then - jesus spoke to the crowds and to disciples of him,
13545 ^ saying,
13546 ^ on - moses’ seat have sat down the scribes and the pharisees.
13556 ^ all things therefore,
15316 ^ having come then also the [one] with the two talents, he said,
15324 ^ master, two talents to me you did deliver.
15329 ^ behold,
15330 ^ more two talents have i gained.
15334 ^ said to him the master of him,
15339 ^ well done, servant good and faithful!
15344 ^ over a few things you were faithful;
15348 ^ over many things you will i set.
15352 ^ enter into the joy of the master of you!
15359 ^ having come then also
15362 ^ the [one] the one talent
15366 ^ having received, he said,
15368 ^ master, i knew you,
15371 ^ that hard you are
15374 ^ a man,
15375 ^ reaping
15376 ^ where not you did sow,
15379 ^ and gathering
15381 ^ from where not you did scatter.
15384 ^ and
15385 ^ having been afraid,
15386 ^ having gone away, i hid the talent of you in the ground.
15394 ^ behold,
15395 ^ you have what [is] yours.
15398 ^ answering now, the master of him said to him,
15405 ^ wicked servant and lazy! you knew
15410 ^ that i reap
15412 ^ where not i sowed,
15415 ^ and gather
15417 ^ from where not i scattered.
15420 ^ it behooved
15421 ^ you therefore to put the money of me to the bankers,
15429 ^ and
15430 ^ having come, i would have received - - my own with interest.
15438 ^ take therefore from him the talent,
15444 ^ and give [it]
15446 ^ to the [one] having the ten talents.
15862 ^ having seen then, the disciples became indignant,
15867 ^ saying,
15868 ^ for what purpose [is] the waste this?
15873 ^ could for
15875 ^ this have been sold for much,
15878 ^ and have been given to [the] poor.
15881 ^ having known [this] now, - jesus said to them,
15887 ^ why trouble do you cause to the woman?
15892 ^ a work for
15894 ^ beautiful she did to me.
15898 ^ always for the poor you have with you;
15905 ^ me however not always you have.
15910 ^ in pouring for this [woman] the fragrant oil this on the body of me,
15920 ^ for the burial of me she did [it].
15925 ^ truly i say to you,
15928 ^ wherever if shall be proclaimed the gospel this in all the world, will be spoken of also
15940 ^ that which did this [woman], for a memorial of her.
15946 ^ then
15947 ^ having gone one of the twelve,
15951 ^ the [one] being called judas iscariot,
15955 ^ to the chief priests, he said,
16121 ^ answering now judas,
16124 ^ who was betraying him, said,
16128 ^ not i is it, rabbi?
16132 ^ he says to him,
16134 ^ you have said.
16136 ^ [as] they were eating now of them,
16139 ^ having taken - jesus
16142 ^ bread,
16143 ^ and having blessed, broke [it],
16146 ^ and
16147 ^ having given to the disciples, he said,
16151 ^ take,
16152 ^ eat;
16153 ^ this is the body of me.
16158 ^ and
16159 ^ having taken a cup
16161 ^ and having given thanks, he gave [it] to them,
16165 ^ saying,
16166 ^ drink of it, all of you.
16170 ^ this for is the blood of me, of the covenant,
16178 ^ - for many
16181 ^ being poured out for forgiveness of sins.
16185 ^ i say now to you,
16188 ^ no not will i drink, from now, of this the fruit of the vine, until the day that,
16203 ^ when it i drink with you anew in the kingdom of the father of me.
16215 ^ and
16216 ^ having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount - of olives.
16223 ^ then says to them - jesus,
16228 ^ all you will fall away because of me during the night this.
16237 ^ it has been written for:
16239 ^ i will strike the shepherd,
16242 ^ and will be scattered the sheep of the flock.’
16248 ^ after however - being raised, i will go before you into - galilee.
16258 ^ answering now, - peter said to him,
16264 ^ if all will fall away because of you,
16269 ^ i never will fall away.
16272 ^ said to him - jesus,
16276 ^ truly i say to you
16279 ^ that during this - night,
16284 ^ before [the] rooster
16286 ^ crowing, three times you will deny me.
16290 ^ says to him - peter,
16294 ^ even if it were necessary for
16296 ^ me with you to die,
16300 ^ no not you will i deny.
16304 ^ likewise also, all the disciples said.
16310 ^ then comes with them - jesus to a place
16318 ^ called gethsemane,
16320 ^ and he says to the disciples,
16324 ^ sit here,
16326 ^ until that
16328 ^ having gone away over there, i shall pray.
16331 ^ and
16332 ^ having taken with [him] - peter and the two sons of zebedee, he began
16341 ^ to be sorrowful
16342 ^ and deeply distressed.
16344 ^ then he says to them,
16347 ^ very sorrowful is the soul of me, even to death;
16354 ^ remain here
16356 ^ and watch with me.
16360 ^ and
16361 ^ having gone forward a little, he fell upon face of him,
16367 ^ praying,
16368 ^ and saying,
16370 ^ father of me, if possible it is,
16375 ^ let pass from me the cup this.
16381 ^ nevertheless not as i will,
16386 ^ but as you.
16389 ^ and he comes to the disciples
16394 ^ and finds them
16397 ^ sleeping.
16398 ^ and he says - to peter,
16402 ^ thus not were you able
16405 ^ one hour to watch with me?
16410 ^ watch
16411 ^ and pray,
16413 ^ that not you enter into temptation.
16418 ^ the indeed
16420 ^ spirit [is] willing,
16422 ^ - but
16424 ^ the flesh weak.
16426 ^ again
16427 ^ for a second time having gone away, he prayed,
16431 ^ saying,
16432 ^ father of me, if not is possible
16437 ^ this to pass
16439 ^ if not it i drink,
16443 ^ be done the will of you.
16447 ^ and
16448 ^ having come again, he finds them
16452 ^ sleeping,
16453 ^ were for of them the eyes
16458 ^ heavy.
16459 ^ and
16460 ^ having left them
16462 ^ again, having gone away, he prayed for [the] third time,
16467 ^ the same thing having said again.
16472 ^ then he comes to the disciples
16477 ^ and says to them,
16480 ^ sleep - later on
16483 ^ and take your rest.
16485 ^ behold,
16486 ^ has drawn near the hour,
16489 ^ and the son - of man is betrayed into [the] hands of sinners.
16498 ^ rise up,
16499 ^ let us go!
16500 ^ behold,
16501 ^ has drawn near
16502 ^ he who is betraying me!
16505 ^ and yet of him as he is speaking,
16509 ^ behold,
16510 ^ judas, one of the twelve, came,
16515 ^ and with him a crowd great, with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
16921 ^ having gone out then to the porch, saw him another [servant girl],
16929 ^ and says to those there,
16933 ^ this [man] was with jesus of nazareth.
16939 ^ and again he denied with an oath
16944 ^ -, not i know the man.
16949 ^ after a little while, also
16952 ^ having come to [him]
16953 ^ those standing by, they said - to peter,
16958 ^ surely also you of them are,
16964 ^ even for the speech of you away you gives.
16972 ^ then he began
16974 ^ to curse
16975 ^ and to swear
16977 ^ -, not i know the man!
16982 ^ and immediately a rooster crowed.
16986 ^ and remembered - peter the word of jesus,
16993 ^ he having said
16994 ^ -,
16995 ^ before [the] rooster
16997 ^ crowing, three times you will deny me.
17001 ^ and
17002 ^ having gone out, he wept bitterly.
17006 ^ morning then having arrived,
17009 ^ counsel took all the chief priests and the elders of the people against - jesus,
17022 ^ so that they might put to death him.
17025 ^ and
17026 ^ having bound him, they led away [him]
17029 ^ and delivered him to pilate, the governor.
17034 ^ then
17035 ^ having seen judas,
17037 ^ the [one] having delivered up him,
17040 ^ that he was condemned,
17042 ^ having regretted [it], he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
17051 ^ saying,
17052 ^ i sinned,
17053 ^ having betrayed blood innocent.
17056 ^ - then they said,
17059 ^ what [is that] to us?
17062 ^ you will see.
17064 ^ and
17065 ^ having cast down the pieces of silver into the temple, he withdrew,
17072 ^ and
17073 ^ having gone away, hanged himself.
17075 ^ - and
17077 ^ the chief priests,
17078 ^ having taken the pieces of silver, said,
17082 ^ not it is lawful
17084 ^ to put them into the treasury,
17089 ^ since [the] price of blood it is.
17093 ^ counsel then having taken, they bought with them the field of the potter, for a burial place for the strangers.
17107 ^ therefore was called the field that, field of blood, to - this day.
17117 ^ then was fulfilled
17119 ^ that having been spoken by jeremiah the prophet,
17125 ^ saying,
17126 ^ and they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price
17133 ^ of the [one] having been priced,
17135 ^ whom they set a price on by [the] sons of israel,
17140 ^ and they gave them for the field of the potter,
17148 ^ as directed me [the] lord.”
17152 ^ - and
17154 ^ jesus stood before the governor;
17159 ^ and questioned him the governor,
17164 ^ saying,
17165 ^ you are the king of the jews?
17171 ^ - and
17173 ^ jesus said,
17175 ^ you say.
17177 ^ and
17178 ^ in - being accused his by the chief priests and elders, nothing he answered.
17189 ^ then says to him - pilate,
17194 ^ not do you hear
17196 ^ how many things you they witness against?
17199 ^ and not he did answer him, to not even one word,
17207 ^ so as to amaze the governor exceedingly.
17212 ^ at now
17214 ^ [the] feast, was accustomed the governor
17218 ^ to release one to the multitude
17222 ^ prisoner,
17223 ^ whom they were wishing.
17225 ^ they were holding now at that time a prisoner notable,
17230 ^ called jesus barabbas.
17233 ^ being gathered together therefore of them,
17236 ^ said to them - pilate,
17303 ^ answering now, the governor said to them,
17488 ^ going forth now, they found a man of cyrene, named simon.
17495 ^ him they compelled
17497 ^ that he might carry the cross of him.
17502 ^ and
17503 ^ having come to a place
17506 ^ called golgotha,
17508 ^ which is
17510 ^ of a skull place called, they gave him
17515 ^ to drink wine
17517 ^ with gall mingled;
17520 ^ and
17521 ^ having tasted, not he was willing
17524 ^ to drink [it].
17525 ^ having crucified now him, they divided the garments of him,
17532 ^ casting lots.
17534 ^ and
17535 ^ sitting down, they were guarding him there.
17539 ^ and they put up over the head of him the accusation of him
17548 ^ written:
17549 ^ this is jesus, the king of the jews.
17556 ^ at the same time are crucified with him two robbers, one at [the] right hand, and one at [the] left.
18079 ^ answering now, the angel said to the women,
18086 ^ not fear you;
18089 ^ i know for
18091 ^ that jesus,
18093 ^ the [one] having been crucified, you seek.
18096 ^ not he is here;
18099 ^ he is risen for,
18101 ^ as he said.
18103 ^ come,
18104 ^ see the place
18107 ^ where he was lying.
18109 ^ and
18110 ^ quickly having gone, say to the disciples of him
18116 ^ that he is risen from the dead
18121 ^ and behold,
18123 ^ he goes before you into - galilee;
18128 ^ there him you will see.
18131 ^ behold,
18132 ^ i have told you.
18134 ^ and
18135 ^ having gone out quickly from the tomb with fear and joy great, they ran
18146 ^ to tell the disciples of him.
18150 ^ and behold,
18152 ^ jesus met them,
18155 ^ saying,
18156 ^ greetings!
18157 ^ - and
18159 ^ having come to [him], they took hold of his - feet
18164 ^ and worshiped him.
18167 ^ then says to them - jesus,
18172 ^ not fear.
18174 ^ go,
18175 ^ tell the brothers, of me
18179 ^ so that they should go into - galilee,
18184 ^ and there me will they see.
18187 ^ [as] were going now they,
18190 ^ behold,
18191 ^ some of the guard,
18194 ^ having gone into the city, reported to the chief priests
18201 ^ all the things having been done.
18204 ^ and
18205 ^ having been gathered together with the elders,
18209 ^ counsel then having taken, silver pieces many they gave to the soldiers,
18217 ^ saying,
18218 ^ say
18219 ^ that the disciples of him,
18223 ^ by night having come, stole him,
18227 ^ we being asleep.
18229 ^ and if is heard this by the governor,
18236 ^ we will persuade him,
18239 ^ and you out of trouble will keep.
18243 ^ - and
18245 ^ having taken the money, they did
18249 ^ as they were instructed.
18251 ^ and is spread abroad the report this among [the] jews, until the present day.
18262 ^ - and
18264 ^ the eleven disciples went into - galilee, to the mountain
18273 ^ where assigned them - jesus.
18278 ^ and
18279 ^ having seen him they worshiped;
18282 ^ some however doubted.
18285 ^ and
18286 ^ having come to [them], - jesus spoke to them,
18291 ^ saying,
18292 ^ has been given to me all authority in heaven and on the earth.
18302 ^ having gone therefore, disciple all the nations,
18308 ^ baptizing them in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy spirit,
18322 ^ teaching them
18324 ^ to observe all things,
18326 ^ whatever i commanded you.
18329 ^ and behold,
18331 ^ i with you am all the days, until the completion of the age.
18343 ^ [the] beginning of the gospel of jesus christ, son of god.
18350 ^ as it has been written in - isaiah the prophet:
18357 ^ behold,
18358 ^ i send the messenger of me before face of you,
18365 ^ who will prepare the way of you.”
18370 ^ [the] voice
18371 ^ of one crying in the wilderness,
18375 ^ prepare the way of [the] lord,
18379 ^ straight make the paths of him.’”
18384 ^ came john,
18386 ^ - baptizing in the wilderness
18391 ^ and proclaiming [a] baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.
18398 ^ and were going out to him all the of judea region, and - of jerusalem, all
18410 ^ and were being baptized by him in the jordan river,
18418 ^ confessing the sins of them.
18422 ^ and was - john
18426 ^ clothed in hair of a camel, and a belt of leather around the waist of him;
18436 ^ and he is eating locusts and honey wild.
18442 ^ and he was preaching,
18444 ^ saying,
18445 ^ he comes who [is] mightier than i after me,
18451 ^ of whom not i am sufficient,
18455 ^ having stooped down, to untie the strap of the sandals of him.
18462 ^ i baptized you with water;
18466 ^ he however will baptize you with [the] spirit holy.
18473 ^ and it came to pass in those - days,
18479 ^ [that] came jesus from nazareth - of galilee,
18485 ^ and was baptized in the jordan by john.
18492 ^ and
18493 ^ immediately going up from the water, he saw
18499 ^ tearing open the heavens, and the spirit
18505 ^ as a dove descending upon him.
18510 ^ and a voice came out of the heavens:
18516 ^ you are the son of me, the beloved,
18523 ^ in you i am well pleased.
18526 ^ and immediately the spirit him drives out into the wilderness.
18535 ^ and he was in the wilderness forty days,
18542 ^ being tempted by - satan.
18546 ^ and he was with the wild animals;
18551 ^ and the angels were ministering to him.
18556 ^ after and
18558 ^ the delivering up - of john, came - jesus into - galilee,
18568 ^ proclaiming the gospel - of god
18573 ^ and saying
18575 ^ -, has been fulfilled the time,
18579 ^ and has drawn near the kingdom - of god;
18585 ^ repent
18586 ^ and believe in the gospel.
18591 ^ and
18592 ^ passing by the sea - of galilee, he saw simon and andrew, the brother of simon,
18605 ^ casting a net into the sea;
18609 ^ they were for fishermen.
18612 ^ and said to them - jesus,
18617 ^ come after me,
18620 ^ and i will make
18622 ^ you to become fishers of men.
18626 ^ and immediately,
18628 ^ having left the nets, they followed him.
18633 ^ and
18634 ^ having gone on a little, he saw james the [son] - of zebedee, and john the brother of him, and they
18648 ^ [were] in the boat adjusting the nets.
18654 ^ and immediately he called them;
18658 ^ and
18659 ^ having left the father of them zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, they went away after him.
18673 ^ and they go into capernaum;
18677 ^ and immediately on the sabbaths,
18681 ^ having entered into the synagogue, he was teaching.
18686 ^ and they were astonished at the teaching of him;
18692 ^ he was for
18694 ^ teaching them
18696 ^ as authority having,
18699 ^ and not as the scribes.
18704 ^ and immediately there was in the synagogue of them a man with a spirit unclean,
18715 ^ and he cried out,
18717 ^ saying,
18718 ^ what to us and to you, jesus of nazareth?
18724 ^ did you come
18725 ^ to destroy us?
18727 ^ i know you
18729 ^ who are,
18731 ^ the holy [one] - of god!
18735 ^ and rebuked him - jesus,
18740 ^ saying
18741 ^ be silent,
18742 ^ and come forth out of him!
18746 ^ and
18747 ^ having thrown into convulsions him the spirit - unclean,
18753 ^ and having cried in a voice loud, it came forth out of him.
18760 ^ and were astonished all,
18763 ^ so as to question among themselves,
18767 ^ saying,
18768 ^ what is this
18771 ^ teaching new? with authority,
18775 ^ even the spirits - unclean he commands,
18781 ^ and they obey him!
18784 ^ and went out the news of him immediately, everywhere into all the surrounding region - of galilee.
18797 ^ and immediately,
18799 ^ out of the synagogue having gone forth, they came into the house of simon and andrew, with james and john.
18814 ^ - and
18816 ^ the mother-in-law of simon was laying sick
18819 ^ fevering.
18820 ^ and immediately they speak to him about her.
18826 ^ and
18827 ^ having come to [her], he raised up her,
18830 ^ having taken hold of the hand.
18833 ^ and left her the fever,
18838 ^ and she began to minister to them.
18841 ^ evening now having come,
18844 ^ when went down the sun,
18848 ^ they began bringing to him
18851 ^ all those sick
18854 ^ being,
18855 ^ and those being possessed by demons.
18858 ^ and was all the city
18863 ^ gathered together at the door.
18867 ^ and he healed many
18870 ^ sick being of various diseases,
18874 ^ and demons many he cast out.
18878 ^ and not he would allow
18881 ^ to speak the demons,
18884 ^ because they knew him.
18887 ^ and
18888 ^ very early, in night still much, having risen up, he went out
18893 ^ and departed into solitary a place,
18898 ^ and there he was praying.
18900 ^ and went after him simon and those with him,
18908 ^ and having found him,
18911 ^ also they say to him
18914 ^ -, everyone seeks you!
18918 ^ and he says to them,
18921 ^ let us go another way into the
18925 ^ neighboring towns,
18927 ^ so that also there i might preach;
18931 ^ for this therefore have i come forth.
18935 ^ and he was going,
18937 ^ preaching in the synagogues of them, in all - galilee,
18946 ^ and - demons casting out.
18950 ^ and comes to him a leper,
18955 ^ imploring him
18957 ^ and kneeling down to him,
18959 ^ and saying to him
18962 ^ -, if you are willing,
18965 ^ you are able
18966 ^ me to cleanse.
18968 ^ and
18969 ^ having been moved with compassion,
18970 ^ having stretched out the hand of him, he touched him
18975 ^ and says to him,
18978 ^ i am willing;
18979 ^ be you cleansed.
18980 ^ and immediately departed from him the leprosy,
18987 ^ and he was cleansed.
18989 ^ and
18990 ^ having sternly warned him, immediately he sent away him.
18995 ^ and he says to him,
18998 ^ see [that]
18999 ^ nothing to none you speak.
19002 ^ but go,
19004 ^ yourself show to the priest,
19008 ^ and offer for the cleansing of you
19014 ^ what commanded moses, for a testimony to them.
19020 ^ - and
19022 ^ having gone out, he began
19024 ^ to proclaim much
19026 ^ and to spread abroad the matter,
19030 ^ so that no longer he was able
19034 ^ openly into [the] city to enter;
19038 ^ but out in solitary places he was,
19044 ^ and they were coming to him from every quarter.
19049 ^ and
19050 ^ he having entered again into capernaum after [some] days, it was heard
19057 ^ that in [the] house he is.
19061 ^ and were gathered together many,
19064 ^ so that no more to have space, not even - at the door;
19072 ^ and he was speaking to them the word.
19077 ^ and they come,
19079 ^ bringing to him a paralytic,
19083 ^ being carried by four.
19086 ^ and
19087 ^ not being able
19089 ^ to come near to him on account of the crowd, they removed the roof
19097 ^ where he was,
19099 ^ and
19100 ^ having broken up [it], they let down the pallet
19104 ^ on which the paralytic was lying.
19108 ^ and
19109 ^ having seen - jesus the faith of them, he says to the paralytic,
19118 ^ son, are forgiven of you the sins.
19123 ^ were now some of the scribes
19128 ^ there sitting
19130 ^ and reasoning in the hearts of them,
19136 ^ why this [man] thus does speak?
19140 ^ he blasphemes!
19141 ^ who is able
19143 ^ to forgive sins,
19145 ^ if not alone - god?
19150 ^ and
19151 ^ immediately, having known - jesus in the spirit of him
19158 ^ that thus they are reasoning within themselves, he says to them,
19165 ^ why these things reason you in the hearts of you?
19172 ^ which is easier,
19175 ^ to say to the paralytic,
19178 ^ are forgiven of you the sins,
19182 ^ or to say,
19184 ^ arise,
19185 ^ and take up the mat of you,
19190 ^ and walk
19192 ^ that however you might know
19195 ^ that authority has the son - of man
19202 ^ to forgive sins on the earth...
19207 ^ he says to the paralytic,
19210 ^ to you i say,
19212 ^ arise,
19213 ^ take up the mat of you,
19217 ^ and go to the home of you.
19223 ^ and he arose
19225 ^ and immediately,
19227 ^ having taken up the mat, he went forth before all,
19233 ^ so as for to be amazed all,
19236 ^ and to glorify - god,
19240 ^ saying
19241 ^ -, thus never did we see.
19245 ^ and he went forth again beside the sea,
19251 ^ and all the crowd was coming to him,
19258 ^ and he taught them.
19261 ^ and
19262 ^ passing on, he saw levi the [son] - of alphaeus
19268 ^ sitting at the tax booth,
19272 ^ and he says to him,
19275 ^ follow me.
19277 ^ and
19278 ^ having arisen, he followed him.
19281 ^ and it came to pass,
19283 ^ reclining of him in the house of him,
19289 ^ that many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with - jesus and the disciples of him;
19301 ^ there were for many,
19304 ^ and they were following him.
19307 ^ and the scribes of the pharisees,
19312 ^ having seen
19313 ^ him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, were saying to the disciples of him,
19324 ^ why with the tax collectors and sinners does he eat?”
19331 ^ and
19332 ^ having heard, - jesus says to them
19337 ^ -, no need have
19341 ^ those being strong
19343 ^ of a physician,
19344 ^ but
19345 ^ those sick
19347 ^ being.
19348 ^ not i came
19350 ^ to call [the] righteous ,
19352 ^ but sinners.
19354 ^ and were the disciples of john and the pharisees
19362 ^ fasting.
19363 ^ and they come
19365 ^ and say to him,
19368 ^ because of why the disciples of john and the disciples of the pharisees fast,
19379 ^ - but
19381 ^ your disciples not fast?
19385 ^ and said to them - jesus,
19390 ^ not are able the sons of the bridechamber,
19396 ^ in which the bridegroom with them is,
19403 ^ to fast?
19404 ^ as long as time they have the bridegroom with them,
19411 ^ not they are able
19413 ^ to fast.
19414 ^ will come however [the] days
19417 ^ when will have been taken away from them the bridegroom,
19423 ^ and then they will fast in those the days.
19430 ^ no one a patch of cloth unshrunk sews on clothing old;
19438 ^ if now not
19441 ^ tears away the patch from it,
19446 ^ - new from the old,
19450 ^ and worse a tear takes place.
19454 ^ and no one puts wine new into wineskins old;
19462 ^ if now not,
19465 ^ will burst the wine the wineskins,
19470 ^ and the wine will be destroyed,
19474 ^ and the wineskins.
19477 ^ instead, wine new into wineskins new.”
19483 ^ and it came to pass,
19485 ^ he on the sabbaths is passing through the grainfields,
19493 ^ and the disciples of him began
19498 ^ [their] way to make,
19500 ^ plucking the heads of grain.
19503 ^ and the pharisees were saying to him,
19508 ^ behold,
19509 ^ why do they on the sabbaths
19513 ^ that which not is lawful?
19516 ^ and he said to them,
19519 ^ never did you read
19521 ^ what did david,
19524 ^ when need he had
19527 ^ and hungered, he and those with him?
19534 ^ how he entered into the house - of god in [the days of] abiathar the high priest,
19544 ^ and the loaves of the presentation ate,
19550 ^ which not it is lawful
19553 ^ to eat,
19554 ^ if not for the priests.
19558 ^ and he gave even
19561 ^ to those with him
19564 ^ being?
19565 ^ and he said to them,
19568 ^ the sabbath on account of the man was made,
19574 ^ and not the man on account of the sabbath.
19581 ^ so then, lord is the son - of man also even
19589 ^ of the sabbath.
19591 ^ and he entered again into the synagogue,
19597 ^ and there was there a man,
21718 ^ departing from there, shake off the dust which [is] under the feet of you, for a testimony against them.”
21731 ^ and
21732 ^ having gone out, they preached
21734 ^ that they should repent.
21736 ^ and demons many they were casting out,
21740 ^ and were anointing with oil many sick
21745 ^ and healing [them].
21747 ^ and heard - king herod;
21752 ^ well known for became the name of him.
21758 ^ and they were saying
21760 ^ -, john,
21762 ^ the [one] baptizing, is risen out from [the] dead,
21767 ^ and because of this operate the miraculous powers in him.
21775 ^ others however were saying
21778 ^ -, elijah he is.
21781 ^ others now were saying
21784 ^ -, a prophet, like one of the prophets.
21790 ^ having heard now, - herod was saying,
21795 ^ whom i beheaded, john —
21799 ^ he is risen!
21801 ^ himself for
21803 ^ - herod,
21805 ^ having sent, seized - john
21809 ^ and bound him in prison, on account of herodias, the wife of philip the brother of him,
21822 ^ because her he had married.
21825 ^ had been saying for - john - to herod
21831 ^ -, not it is lawful for you
21835 ^ to have the wife of the brother of you.
21841 ^ - and
21843 ^ herodias held it against him,
21846 ^ and wished
21848 ^ him to kill,
21850 ^ and not was able;
21853 ^ - for
21855 ^ herod was afraid of - john,
21859 ^ knowing him [to be] a man righteous and holy;
21865 ^ and he kept safe him.
21868 ^ and
21869 ^ having heard him, greatly he was perplexed
21873 ^ and gladly him heard.
21877 ^ and having come [a] day opportune,
21881 ^ when herod on the birthday of him a banquet made to the great men of him, and to the chief captains, and to the leading [men] - of galilee,
21899 ^ and having come in the daughter of him herodias,
21905 ^ and having danced,
21907 ^ pleased - herod
21910 ^ and those reclining with [him].
21913 ^ said the king to the girl,
21918 ^ ask me
21920 ^ whatever if you wish,
21923 ^ and i will give to you.
21926 ^ and he swore to her, whatever
21930 ^ that if me you might ask,
21934 ^ i will give you, up to half of the kingdom of me.
21941 ^ and
21942 ^ having gone out, she said to the mother of her,
21947 ^ what shall i ask?
21949 ^ - and she said,
21952 ^ the head of john
21955 ^ the [one] baptizing.
21957 ^ and
21958 ^ having entered immediately with haste to the king, she asked,
21966 ^ saying,
21967 ^ i desire
21968 ^ that at once you give to me upon a platter the head of john the baptist.
21979 ^ and
21980 ^ encompassingly sorrowful having been made the king, on account of the oaths and
21988 ^ those reclining with [him], not was he willing
21992 ^ to refuse her.
21994 ^ and immediately
21996 ^ having sent the king an executioner, he commanded
22001 ^ to be brought the head of him.
22005 ^ and
22006 ^ having gone, he beheaded him in the prison,
22012 ^ and brought the head of him upon a platter,
22019 ^ and gave it to the girl,
22024 ^ and the girl gave it to the mother of her.
22032 ^ and
22033 ^ having heard [it], the disciples of him came,
22038 ^ and took up the body of him,
22043 ^ and laid it in [a] tomb.
22048 ^ and are gathered together the apostles to - jesus,
22055 ^ and they related to him all things,
22059 ^ what they had done
22061 ^ and what they had taught.
22064 ^ and he said to them,
22067 ^ come you yourselves apart own to [a] solitary place,
22075 ^ and rest a little.
22078 ^ were for
22080 ^ those coming
22082 ^ and those going many,
22086 ^ and
22087 ^ not even to eat had they opportunity.
22090 ^ and they went away by the boat into [a] solitary place by themselves.
22100 ^ and they saw them
22103 ^ going,
22104 ^ and recognized many,
22107 ^ and on foot from all the cities ran together there,
22115 ^ and went before them.
22118 ^ and
22119 ^ having gone out, he saw a great crowd
22123 ^ and was moved with compassion toward them,
22127 ^ because they were like sheep
22131 ^ not having a shepherd.
22134 ^ and he began
22136 ^ to teach them many things.
22139 ^ and already the hour late being,
22144 ^ having come to him, the disciples of him were saying
22150 ^ -, desolate is the place,
22155 ^ and already [it is] an hour late.
22159 ^ dismiss them,
22161 ^ that
22162 ^ having gone to the surrounding region and villages, they might buy for themselves
22171 ^ something to eat.
22173 ^ - but
22175 ^ answering, he said to them,
22178 ^ give to them you
22181 ^ [something] to eat.
22182 ^ and they say to him,
22185 ^ having gone, shall we buy denarii two hundred of bread,
22190 ^ and give them
22193 ^ to eat?
22194 ^ - and he says to them,
22198 ^ how many loaves? have you
22201 ^ go,
22202 ^ see.
22203 ^ and
22204 ^ having known, they say,
22206 ^ five, and two fish.
22210 ^ and he commanded them
22213 ^ to make recline all, groups [by] groups on the green grass.
22221 ^ and they sat down groups [by] groups, by hundreds and by fifties.
22230 ^ and
22231 ^ having taken the five loaves and the two fish,
22239 ^ having looked up to the heaven, he blessed
22244 ^ and broke the loaves,
22248 ^ and he kept giving [them] to the disciples of him
22253 ^ that they might set before them.
22256 ^ and the two fish he divided among all.
22262 ^ and ate all
22265 ^ and were satisfied.
22267 ^ and they took up of fragments twelve hand-baskets full, and of the fish.
22277 ^ and were
22279 ^ those having eaten of the loaves five thousand men.
22285 ^ and immediately he compelled
22288 ^ the disciples of him to enter into the boat
22295 ^ and to go before to the other side, to bethsaida,
22302 ^ until he should dismiss the crowd.
22307 ^ and
22308 ^ having taken leave of them, he departed into the mountain
22314 ^ to pray.
22315 ^ and evening having come,
22318 ^ was the boat in the midst of the sea,
22325 ^ and he alone upon the land.
22331 ^ and
22332 ^ he having seen them
22334 ^ straining
22335 ^ in the rowing,
22338 ^ was for the wind contrary to them.
22344 ^ about [the] fourth watch of the night he comes to them,
22352 ^ walking on the sea,
22356 ^ and he was wishing
22358 ^ to pass by them.
22360 ^ - and
22362 ^ having seen him
22364 ^ on the sea walking, they thought
22369 ^ that a ghost [it] is,
22372 ^ and cried out.
22374 ^ all for him saw
22378 ^ and were troubled.
22380 ^ - and immediately he spoke with them,
22386 ^ and says to them,
22389 ^ take courage;
22390 ^ i am [he];
22392 ^ not fear.
22394 ^ and he went up to them into the boat,
22401 ^ and ceased the wind.
22405 ^ and exceedingly in abundance in themselves they were amazed,
22412 ^ not for they understood by the loaves;
22418 ^ but had been of them the heart
22423 ^ hardened.
22424 ^ and
22425 ^ having passed over to the land, they came to gennesaret
22432 ^ and drew to shore.
22434 ^ and on having come of them out of the boat,
22440 ^ immediately
22441 ^ having recognized him, they ran around all the country that,
22448 ^ and they began
22450 ^ on the mats
22453 ^ those sick
22455 ^ being to carry about,
22457 ^ to wherever they were hearing
22459 ^ that he is.
22461 ^ and wherever - he entered into villages or into cities or into fields,
22473 ^ in the marketplaces they were laying
22477 ^ the ailing,
22479 ^ and were begging him
22482 ^ that only the fringe the clothing of him they might touch;
22490 ^ and
22491 ^ as many as - touched him were being healed.
22496 ^ and are gathered together to him the pharisees and some of the scribes,
22506 ^ having come from jerusalem.
22509 ^ and they had seen some of the disciples of him
22515 ^ that with defiled hands,
22518 ^ that is unwashed, are eating the bread.
22524 ^ - for
22526 ^ the pharisees and all the jews,
22531 ^ if not carefully they wash the hands, not eat,
22539 ^ holding the tradition of the elders;
22544 ^ and [on coming] from the market,
22547 ^ if not they wash not they eat;
22552 ^ and other things many there are
22556 ^ which they received
22558 ^ [for them] to hold to —
22559 ^ washings of cups and vessels and utensils and couches for dining.
22567 ^ and questioned him the pharisees and the scribes,
22575 ^ because of why not walk the disciples of you according to the tradition of the elders,
22587 ^ but with unwashed hands eat the bread?
22593 ^ - and he said to them,
22597 ^ rightly prophesied isaiah concerning you - hypocrites,
22604 ^ as it has been written
22606 ^ -: this - people with the lips me honors,
22614 ^ - but
22616 ^ the heart of them far away is kept from me.
22622 ^ in vain now they worship me,
22626 ^ teaching [as] doctrines [the] precepts of men.’
22630 ^ having neglected the commandment - of god, you hold to the tradition - of men.”
22640 ^ and he was saying to them,
22643 ^ neatly do you set aside the commandment - of god,
22649 ^ that the tradition of you, you might keep.
22654 ^ moses for said,
22657 ^ honor the father of you and the mother of you,’
22665 ^ and,
22666 ^ the [one] speaking evil of father or mother, in death must end.’
22673 ^ you however say [that]
22676 ^ if says a man to the father or the mother,
22684 ^ [it is] corban,
22685 ^ that is, a gift,
22688 ^ whatever if from me you might be profited,
22693 ^ no longer do you allow him
22696 ^ anything to do for the father or the mother,
22703 ^ making void the word - of god for the tradition of you
22711 ^ which you have handed down.
22713 ^ and like [things] such many you do.
22718 ^ and
22719 ^ having called to [him] again the crowd, he was saying to them,
22725 ^ listen to me, all,
22728 ^ and understand:
22730 ^ nothing there is
22732 ^ from outside the man
22735 ^ entering into him,
22738 ^ which is able
22740 ^ to defile him;
22742 ^ but
22743 ^ the things out of the man
22747 ^ proceeding are
22749 ^ the things defiling the man.”
22753 ^ and when he went into [the] house from the crowd,
22761 ^ were asking him the disciples of him the parable.
22768 ^ and he says to them,
22771 ^ thus also you without understanding are?
22776 ^ not understand you
22778 ^ that
22779 ^ everything - from outside
22782 ^ entering into the man, not is able
22788 ^ him to defile,
22790 ^ because not it enters of him into the heart, but into the belly,
22801 ^ and into the sewer goes out?”
22806 ^ purifying all the food.
22810 ^ he was saying now
22812 ^ -,
22813 ^ that out of the man
22817 ^ going forth,
22818 ^ that defiles the man.
22822 ^ within for from the heart - of men - thoughts - evil go forth,
22834 ^ sexual immorality, thefts, murders, adulteries, covetous desires, wickednesses, deceit, sensuality, an eye evil, slander, pride, foolishness.
22847 ^ all these - evils from within go forth,
22853 ^ and they defile the man.
22857 ^ from there also
22859 ^ having risen up, he went away into the region of tyre.
22865 ^ and
22866 ^ having entered into a house, no one he was wishing
22871 ^ to know [it],
22872 ^ and not he was able
22875 ^ to be hidden.
22876 ^ but immediately
22878 ^ having heard a woman about him,
23114 ^ having called to [him] the disciples, he says to them,
23119 ^ i am moved with compassion upon the crowd,
23123 ^ because already days three they continue with me,
23129 ^ and nothing have
23132 ^ that they might eat.
23134 ^ and if i shall send away them hungry to [the] homes of them,
23142 ^ they will faint on the way.
23146 ^ for some of them from afar are come.
23152 ^ and answered him the disciples of him
23158 ^ -,
23159 ^ from where these will be able anyone here to satisfy with bread in this desolate place?
23168 ^ and he was asking them,
23171 ^ how many have you
23173 ^ loaves?
23174 ^ - and they said,
23177 ^ seven.
23178 ^ and he directs the crowd
23182 ^ to recline on the ground.
23186 ^ and
23187 ^ having taken the seven loaves,
23191 ^ having given thanks, he broke [them]
23193 ^ and kept giving [them] to disciples of him,
23198 ^ that they might set before [them].
23200 ^ and they set [it] before the crowd.
23204 ^ and they had small fish a few.
23208 ^ and
23209 ^ having blessed them, he ordered
23212 ^ also these to be set before [them].
23215 ^ and they ate
23217 ^ and were satisfied.
23219 ^ and they took up over and above of fragments seven baskets.
23225 ^ there were now about four thousand.
23229 ^ and he sent away them.
23232 ^ and immediately
23234 ^ having entered into the boat with the disciples of him, he came into the district of dalmanutha.
23247 ^ and went out the pharisees
23251 ^ and began
23253 ^ to dispute with him,
23255 ^ seeking from him a sign from - heaven,
23262 ^ testing him.
23264 ^ and
23265 ^ having sighed deeply in the spirit of him, he says,
23270 ^ why the generation this seeks a sign?
23276 ^ truly i say to you,
23279 ^ if there will be given to the generation this a sign.
23285 ^ and
23286 ^ having left them,
23288 ^ again having embarked, he went away to the other side.
23294 ^ and they forgot
23296 ^ to take loaves,
23298 ^ and if not one loaf
23303 ^ not they had with them in the boat.
23310 ^ and he was instructing them,
23313 ^ saying,
23314 ^ watch out;
23315 ^ take heed of the leaven of the pharisees, and of the leaven of herod.
23325 ^ and they were reasoning with one another
23329 ^ because loaves not they have.
23333 ^ and
23334 ^ having known [it], he says to them,
23337 ^ why reason you
23339 ^ because loaves not you have?
23343 ^ not yet do you perceive
23345 ^ nor understand?
23352 ^ eyes having, not do you see?
23356 ^ and
23357 ^ ears having, not do you hear?
23361 ^ and not do you remember?
23364 ^ when the five loaves i broke for the five thousand,
23372 ^ how many hand-baskets of fragments full took you up?
23377 ^ they say to him,
23379 ^ twelve.
23380 ^ when the seven to the four thousand,
23386 ^ of how many baskets [the] fillings
23389 ^ of fragments took you up?
23391 ^ and said they,
23394 ^ seven.
23395 ^ and he was saying to them,
23398 ^ not yet do you understand?
23400 ^ and they come to bethsaida.
23404 ^ and they bring to him a blind [man],
23408 ^ and implore him
23411 ^ that him he might touch.
23414 ^ and
23415 ^ having taken hold of the hand of the blind [man], he led forth him out of the village,
23425 ^ and
23426 ^ having spit upon the eyes of him,
23431 ^ having laid the hands upon him, he was asking him
23437 ^ if anything you see.
23440 ^ and
23441 ^ having looked up he was saying,
23443 ^ i see the men,
23446 ^ for
23447 ^ as trees i see [them] walking.
23451 ^ then again he laid the hands upon the eyes of him,
23460 ^ and he opened his eyes
23462 ^ and he was restored,
23464 ^ and he began to see clearly everything.
23468 ^ and he sent him to [the] home of him,
23474 ^ saying,
23475 ^ not into the village may you enter.”
23480 ^ and went forth - jesus and the disciples of him into the villages of caesarea - philippi.
23494 ^ and on the way, he was questioning the disciples of him,
23502 ^ saying to them,
23538 ^ answering, - peter says to him,
23543 ^ you are the christ.
23547 ^ and he warned them
23550 ^ that no one they should tell concerning him.
23555 ^ and he began
23557 ^ to teach them
23559 ^ that it is necessary for
23561 ^ the son - of man many things to suffer,
23567 ^ and to be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes,
23578 ^ and to be killed,
23580 ^ and after three days to rise [again].
23585 ^ and openly the word he was speaking.
23590 ^ and
23591 ^ having taken him - peter to him, he began
23596 ^ to rebuke him.
23598 ^ - and
23600 ^ having turned
23601 ^ and having looked upon the disciples of him, he rebuked peter
23608 ^ and said,
23610 ^ get behind me, satan,
23614 ^ for not you have in mind the things of god,
23620 ^ but the things of men.
23624 ^ and
23625 ^ having called to [him] the crowd with the disciples of him, he said to them,
23634 ^ if anyone desires
23637 ^ after me to follow,
23640 ^ let him deny himself,
23642 ^ and let him take up the cross of him,
23647 ^ and let him follow me.
24490 ^ - two hands having, to go away into - hell, into the fire - unquenchable.
24503 ^ and if the foot of you should cause to stumble you,
24510 ^ cut off it;
24512 ^ better it is
24514 ^ for you to enter into - life lame,
24520 ^ than
24521 ^ the two feet having, to be cast into - hell.
24529 ^ and if the eye of you should cause to stumble you,
24536 ^ cast out it;
24538 ^ better
24539 ^ for you it is with one eye to enter into the kingdom - of god,
24548 ^ than
24549 ^ two eyes having to be cast into - hell,
24556 ^ where the worm of them not dies,
24562 ^ and the fire not is quenched.’
24567 ^ everyone for with fire will be salted.
24571 ^ good [is] the salt;
24574 ^ if however the salt unsalty becomes,
24580 ^ with what it will you season?
24584 ^ have in yourselves salt,
24588 ^ and be at peace with one another.
24592 ^ and
24593 ^ from there having risen up, he comes into the region - of judea, and beyond the jordan.
24605 ^ and come together again crowds to him,
24611 ^ and as he had been accustomed,
24614 ^ again he was teaching them.
24617 ^ and
24618 ^ having come to [him], the pharisees were demanding of him
24622 ^ if it is lawful for a husband
24625 ^ a wife to divorce,
24627 ^ testing him.
24629 ^ - and
24631 ^ he answering, said to them,
24634 ^ what you did command moses?
24638 ^ - and they said,
24641 ^ permitted moses
24643 ^ a roll of divorce to write,
24646 ^ and to send [her] away.
24648 ^ - but
24650 ^ jesus said to them,
24653 ^ because of the hardness of heart of you, he wrote for you the commandment this.
24662 ^ from, however,
24664 ^ [the] beginning of creation, male and female he made them.’
24671 ^ on account of this, will leave a man the father of him and - mother
24681 ^ and be joined to - wife his,
24687 ^ and will be the two for flesh one.’
24694 ^ therefore no longer they are two,
24698 ^ but one flesh.
24757 ^ having seen now, - jesus was indignant
24762 ^ and said to them,
24765 ^ permit the little children
24768 ^ to come to me;
24771 ^ not do hinder them!
24774 ^ to the for
24776 ^ such, belongs the kingdom - of god.
24782 ^ truly i say to you,
24992 ^ having looked on them, - jesus says,
24997 ^ with men [it is] impossible,
25000 ^ but not with god;
25004 ^ all things for [are] possible with - god.
25010 ^ began
25011 ^ to say - peter to him,
25015 ^ behold,
25016 ^ we have left all
25019 ^ and followed you.
25022 ^ was saying - jesus,
25025 ^ truly i say to you,
25028 ^ no one there is
25030 ^ who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for the sake of me and because of the gospel,
25051 ^ if not shall take a hundredfold now in the time this — houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions —
25073 ^ and in the age
25077 ^ which is coming, life eternal.
25081 ^ many however will be
25084 ^ first, last;
25086 ^ and the last, first.
25090 ^ they were then on the way,
25095 ^ going up to jerusalem,
25098 ^ and was
25100 ^ going on before them - jesus,
25104 ^ and they were astonished;
27494 ^ having broken the alabaster flask, she poured [it] on his - head.
27501 ^ were now some
27504 ^ indignant within themselves:
27507 ^ to what the waste this of the fragrant oil has been made?
27515 ^ could for this - fragrant oil
27520 ^ to have been sold for above denarii three hundred,
27524 ^ and to have been given to the poor.
27528 ^ and they were grumbling at her.
27531 ^ - and
27533 ^ jesus said,
27535 ^ leave alone her;
27537 ^ why to her trouble do you cause?
27541 ^ a good work she did toward me.
27546 ^ always for the poor you have with you,
27553 ^ and whenever you desire
27556 ^ you are able
27557 ^ them good to do;
27560 ^ me however not always do you have.
27644 ^ having gone, we should prepare
27646 ^ that you may eat the passover?
27650 ^ and he sends forth two of the disciples of him
27656 ^ and says to them,
27659 ^ go into the city,
27663 ^ and will meet you a man,
27667 ^ a pitcher of water carrying.
27670 ^ follow him.
27672 ^ and wherever if he might enter,
27676 ^ say to the master of the house
27679 ^ that the teacher says,
27683 ^ where is the guest room of me,
27688 ^ where the passover with the disciples of me i may eat?
27696 ^ and he you will show an upper room large,
27702 ^ having been furnished [and] ready.
27704 ^ and there prepare for us.
27708 ^ and went away - his disciples,
27712 ^ and came into the city,
27717 ^ and found
27719 ^ as he had said to them,
27722 ^ and they prepared the passover.
27726 ^ and evening having arrived,
27729 ^ he comes with the twelve.
27733 ^ and as were reclining they,
27736 ^ and were eating,
27738 ^ - jesus said,
27741 ^ truly i say to you
27744 ^ that one of you will betray me,
27812 ^ having taken bread,
27814 ^ having spoken a blessing, he broke,
27816 ^ and gave to them,
27819 ^ and said,
27821 ^ take;
27822 ^ this is the body of me.
27827 ^ and
27828 ^ having taken the cup,
27830 ^ having given thanks, he gave [it] to them,
27833 ^ and they drank of it all.
27838 ^ and he said to them,
27841 ^ this is the blood of me of the covenant,
27848 ^ which is being poured out for many.
27852 ^ truly i say to you
27855 ^ that no more never not will i drink of the fruit of the vine, until the day that
27869 ^ when it i drink anew in the kingdom - of god.
27878 ^ and
27879 ^ having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount - of olives.
27886 ^ and says to them - jesus
27891 ^ -, all you will fall away,
27894 ^ for it has been written:
27896 ^ i will strike the shepherd,
27899 ^ and the sheep will be scattered.’
27903 ^ but
27904 ^ after - having arisen, i will go before you into - galilee.
27913 ^ - and
27915 ^ peter was saying to him,
27918 ^ if even all will fall away,
27922 ^ yet not i.
27925 ^ and says to him - jesus,
27930 ^ truly i say to you
27933 ^ that yourself now this - night,
27939 ^ before that twice [the] rooster
27943 ^ crows, three times me you will deny.
27947 ^ - and emphatically he kept saying,
27951 ^ if it is needful
27953 ^ of me to die with you,
27956 ^ no not you will i deny.
27960 ^ likewise now also all of them were saying.
27965 ^ and they come to a place,
27969 ^ of which the name [is] gethsemane;
27973 ^ and he says to the disciples of him,
27978 ^ sit here,
27980 ^ while i shall pray.
27982 ^ and he takes - peter and - james and - john with him;
27994 ^ and he began
27996 ^ to be greatly awe-struck
27997 ^ and deeply distressed.
27999 ^ and he says to them,
28002 ^ very sorrowful is the soul of me, even to death;
28009 ^ remain here
28011 ^ and watch.
28013 ^ and
28014 ^ having gone forward a little, he fell upon the ground
28020 ^ and was praying
28022 ^ that, if possible it is,
28026 ^ might pass from him the hour.
28031 ^ and he was saying,
28033 ^ abba, - father, all things [are] possible to you;
28039 ^ take away the cup this from me;
28045 ^ but not
28047 ^ what i will,
28050 ^ but what you.
28053 ^ and he comes
28055 ^ and finds them
28058 ^ sleeping.
28059 ^ and he says - to peter,
28063 ^ simon, are you asleep?
28065 ^ not were you able
28067 ^ one hour to watch?
28070 ^ watch
28071 ^ and pray,
28073 ^ so that not you may enter into temptation.
28078 ^ the indeed
28080 ^ spirit [is] willing,
28082 ^ - but
28084 ^ the flesh weak.
28086 ^ and
28087 ^ again having gone away, he prayed,
28090 ^ the same thing having said.
28094 ^ and
28095 ^ again having returned, he found them
28099 ^ sleeping.
28100 ^ were for of them the eyes
28105 ^ heavy;
28106 ^ and not they knew
28109 ^ what they should answer him.
28112 ^ and he comes the third time,
28116 ^ and says to them,
28119 ^ are you sleeping - still
28122 ^ and taking your rest.
28124 ^ it is enough;
28125 ^ has come the hour;
28128 ^ behold,
28129 ^ is delivered up the son - of man into the hands of the sinful.
28139 ^ rise,
28140 ^ let us go;
28141 ^ behold,
29102 ^ having run then one
29105 ^ and having filled a sponge with vinegar,
29109 ^ having put [it] on a reed, gave to drink him,
29113 ^ saying,
29114 ^ let be;
29115 ^ let us see
29116 ^ if comes elijah
29119 ^ to take down him.
29121 ^ - but
29123 ^ jesus,
29124 ^ having uttered a cry loud, breathed his last.
29128 ^ and the veil of the temple was torn into two from top to bottom.
29140 ^ having seen then the centurion
29144 ^ - standing from opposite of him
29149 ^ that thus he breathed his last, he said,
29153 ^ truly this - man [the] son of god was!
29160 ^ there were then also women
29164 ^ from afar off looking on,
29167 ^ among whom also mary - magdalene, and mary the of james the least and of joseph mother, and salome,
29184 ^ who,
29185 ^ when he was in - galilee, had been following him
29192 ^ and had been ministering to him, and other many,
29198 ^ those having come up with him to jerusalem.
29203 ^ and already evening having arrived,
29207 ^ since it was [the] preparation,
29210 ^ that is, the day before sabbath,
29213 ^ having come, joseph - from arimathea, a prominent council member,
29220 ^ who also
29222 ^ himself was
29224 ^ waiting for the kingdom - of god,
29229 ^ having boldness, went in to - pilate
29234 ^ and asked for the body - of jesus.
29240 ^ - and
29242 ^ pilate wondered
29244 ^ if already he were dead.
29247 ^ and
29248 ^ having called to [him] the centurion, he questioned him
29253 ^ whether already he had died.
29256 ^ and
29257 ^ having known [it] from the centurion, he granted the body - to joseph.
29266 ^ and
29267 ^ having bought a linen cloth,
29269 ^ having taken down him, he wrapped [him] in the linen cloth
29274 ^ and laid him in a tomb
29279 ^ which was
29281 ^ cut out of a rock.
29284 ^ and he rolled a stone to the door of the tomb.
29292 ^ - and
29294 ^ mary - magdalene and mary the [mother] of joseph were watching
29302 ^ where he was laid.
29304 ^ and having passed the sabbath,
29308 ^ mary - magdalene, and mary the [mother] - of james, and salome, bought spices,
29320 ^ that
29321 ^ having come, they might anoint him.
29324 ^ and very early on the first [day] of the week, they come to the tomb,
29335 ^ having arisen the sun.
29338 ^ and they were saying among themselves,
29342 ^ who will roll away for us the stone from the door of the tomb?
29352 ^ and
29353 ^ having looked up they see
29355 ^ that has been rolled away the stone;
29359 ^ it was for large extremely.
29363 ^ and
29364 ^ having entered into the tomb, they saw a young man
29370 ^ sitting on the right,
29374 ^ clothed in a robe white,
29377 ^ and they were greatly amazed.
29379 ^ - and he says to them,
29383 ^ not be amazed.
29385 ^ jesus you seek,
29387 ^ the nazarene,
29389 ^ the [one] having been crucified.
29391 ^ he is risen!
29392 ^ not he is here!
29395 ^ behold
29396 ^ the place
29398 ^ where they laid him.
29401 ^ but go,
29403 ^ say the disciples of him and - to peter
29410 ^ that he goes before you into - galilee;
29416 ^ there him will you see,
29419 ^ as he said to you.
29422 ^ and
29423 ^ having gone out, they fled from the tomb.
29428 ^ had seized for them trembling and amazement,
29434 ^ and to none nothing they spoke;
29438 ^ they were afraid for.
29440 ^ having risen now early [the] first [day] of the week, he appeared first to mary - magdalene,
29450 ^ from whom he had cast out seven demons.
29455 ^ she
29456 ^ having gone, told [it]
29458 ^ to those with him,
29461 ^ having been
29462 ^ mourning
29463 ^ and weeping.
29465 ^ and they,
29466 ^ having heard
29467 ^ that he is alive
29469 ^ and has been seen by her, disbelieved.
29474 ^ after now
29476 ^ these things, to two of them
29480 ^ as they are walking, he appeared in another form,
29485 ^ going into [the] country.
29488 ^ and they,
29489 ^ having gone, told [it] to the rest;
29493 ^ neither them did they believe.
29496 ^ afterward now
29498 ^ were reclining they; to the eleven he appeared
29503 ^ and rebuked the unbelief of them and hardness of heart,
29510 ^ because
29511 ^ those having seen him
29514 ^ arisen not they believed.
29517 ^ and he said to them,
29520 ^ having gone into the world all, proclaim the gospel to all the creation.
29531 ^ the [one] having believed
29533 ^ and having been baptized will be saved;
29998 ^ having come out then, not he was able
30002 ^ to speak to them,
30004 ^ and they recognized
30006 ^ that a vision he had seen in the temple.
30012 ^ and he was
30015 ^ making signs to them,
30017 ^ and remained mute.
30020 ^ and it came to pass,
30022 ^ when were fulfilled the days of the service of him,
30029 ^ he departed to the home of him.
30034 ^ after then
30036 ^ these - days conceived elizabeth the wife of him,
30044 ^ and hid herself months five,
30049 ^ saying,
30050 ^ - thus to me has done the lord, in [the] days
30057 ^ in which he looked upon [me],
30059 ^ to take away [the] disgrace of me among men.
30064 ^ in now
30066 ^ the month - sixth, was sent the angel gabriel by - god to a city - of galilee,
30081 ^ whose name [was] nazareth, to a virgin
30086 ^ betrothed to a man,
30088 ^ whose name [was] joseph, of [the] house of david;
30094 ^ and the name of the virgin [was] mary.
30100 ^ and
30101 ^ having come to her, he said,
30105 ^ greetings,
30106 ^ [you] favored with grace!
30107 ^ the lord [is] with you.”
30111 ^ - and at the statement she was troubled,
30117 ^ and was pondering
30119 ^ what kind might be the salutation this.
30124 ^ and said the angel to her,
30129 ^ not fear, mary;
30132 ^ you have found for favor with - god;
30138 ^ and behold,
30140 ^ you will conceive in womb,
30143 ^ and will bring forth a son,
30146 ^ and you shall call the name of him jesus.
30152 ^ he will be great,
30155 ^ and son of [the] most high he will be called;
30159 ^ and will give him [the] lord - god the throne of david, of the father of him;
30171 ^ and he will reign over the house of jacob to the ages;
30180 ^ and of the kingdom of him not there will be
30186 ^ an end!
30187 ^ said then mary to the angel,
30193 ^ how will be this,
30196 ^ since a man not i know?
30200 ^ and
30201 ^ answering, the angel said to her,
30206 ^ [the] spirit holy will come upon you,
30211 ^ and power of [the] most high will overshadow you;
30216 ^ therefore also the
30219 ^ being born holy [one] will be called [the] son of god.
30224 ^ and behold,
30226 ^ elizabeth, the relative of you,
30230 ^ also she has conceived a son in old age her,
30237 ^ and this month [the] sixth is to her
30243 ^ who [was] called barren.
30246 ^ for not will be impossible with - god every thing.
30254 ^ said then mary,
30257 ^ behold,
30258 ^ the handmaid of [the] lord.
30261 ^ may it happen to me according to the word of you.
30267 ^ and departed from her the angel.
30273 ^ having risen up then mary in the days this, she went into the hill country with haste, to a town of judah,
30289 ^ and she entered into the house of zechariah
30295 ^ and greeted - elizabeth.
30299 ^ and it came to pass,
30301 ^ as heard the greeting - of mary - elizabeth,
30309 ^ leaped the baby in the womb of her;
30316 ^ and was filled with [the] spirit holy - elizabeth,
30322 ^ and she cried out in a voice loud
30326 ^ and said,
31084 ^ having seen now, they proclaimed abroad concerning the saying
31090 ^ - having been told them concerning the child this.
31097 ^ and
31098 ^ all those having heard marveled
31102 ^ concerning the things having been spoken by the shepherds to them.
31110 ^ - but
31112 ^ mary all was treasuring up
31115 ^ - matters these,
31118 ^ pondering [them] in the heart of her.
31123 ^ and returned the shepherds,
31127 ^ glorifying
31128 ^ and praising - god for all things
31134 ^ which they had heard
31136 ^ and seen,
31138 ^ as it was said to them.
31142 ^ and when were fulfilled days eight
31147 ^ - to circumcise him, then was called the name of him jesus,
31156 ^ which he had been called by the angel
31161 ^ before - was conceived he in the womb.
31168 ^ and when were fulfilled the days of the purification of them according to the law of moses,
31180 ^ they brought him to jerusalem,
31184 ^ to present to the lord
31187 ^ as it has been written in [the] law of [the] lord
31192 ^ -: every male
31195 ^ opening a womb holy to the lord shall be called,”
31201 ^ and - to offer a sacrifice,
31205 ^ according to that having been said in the law of [the] lord,
31212 ^ a pair of turtle doves
31214 ^ or two young pigeons.”
31218 ^ and behold,
31220 ^ a man there was in jerusalem,
31513 ^ in the returning of them, remained behind jesus the boy in jerusalem.
31523 ^ but not knew the parents of him.
31529 ^ having supposed now
31876 ^ answering now, he was saying to them,
32017 ^ many indeed therefore other
32021 ^ things exhorting, he was preaching the good news to the people.
32026 ^ - and
32028 ^ herod the tetrarch,
32031 ^ being reproved by him concerning herodias, the wife of the brother of him, and concerning all
32044 ^ that had done
32046 ^ [the] evils - herod, added yet this to all:
32054 ^ also he locked up - john in prison.
32060 ^ it came to pass now
32062 ^ in - having been baptized all the people,
32068 ^ and jesus having been baptized,
32071 ^ and having prayed,
32073 ^ was opened the heaven,
32076 ^ and descended the spirit - holy in a bodily form as a dove upon him,
32088 ^ and a voice out of heaven came:
32093 ^ you are the son of me, the beloved;
32100 ^ in you i am well pleased.
32103 ^ and himself was
32106 ^ jesus
32107 ^ beginning about years [old] thirty,
32111 ^ being son,
32113 ^ as was supposed, of joseph, - of heli, - of matthat, - of levi, - of melchi, - of jannai, - of joseph, - of mattathias, - of amos, - of nahum, - of esli, - of naggai, - of maath, - of mattathias, - of semein, - of josech, - of joda, - of joannen, - of rhesa, - of zerubbabel, - of shealtiel, - of neri, - of melchi, - of addi, - of cosam, - of elmadam, - of er, - of joshua, - of eliezer, - of jorim, - of matthat, - of levi, - of simeon, - of judah, - of joseph, - of jonam, - of eliakim, - of melea, - of menna, - of mattatha, - of nathan, - of david, - of jesse, - of obed, - of boaz, - of sala, - of nahshon, - of amminadab, - of admin, - of arni, - of hezron, - of perez, - of judah, - of jacob, - of isaac, - of abraham, - of terah, - of nahor, - of serug, - of reu, - of peleg, - of heber, - of shelah, - of cainan, - of arphaxad, - of shem, - of noah, - of lamech, - of methuselah, - of enoch, - of jared, - of mahalalel, - of cainan, - of enosh, - of seth, - of adam, - of god.
32268 ^ jesus then,
32270 ^ full of [the] spirit holy, returned from the jordan
32277 ^ and was led by the spirit into the wilderness,
32285 ^ days forty being tempted by the devil.
32291 ^ and not he ate nothing in the days those,
32299 ^ and having ended they,
32302 ^ he was hungry.
32303 ^ said then to him the devil,
32308 ^ if [the] son you are
32311 ^ - of god,
32313 ^ speak to the stone this,
32317 ^ that it should become bread.
32320 ^ and answered to him - jesus,
32326 ^ it has been written
32327 ^ -: not on bread alone shall live the man.’
32335 ^ and
32336 ^ having led up him, he showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
32348 ^ and said to him the devil,
32353 ^ to you will i give the authority this all, and the glory of it;
32363 ^ for to me it has been delivered,
32366 ^ and
32367 ^ to whom if i wish, i give it.
32372 ^ you therefore,
32374 ^ if you will worship before me,
32378 ^ will be yours all.
32381 ^ and
32382 ^ answering, - jesus said to him,
32387 ^ it has been written:
32388 ^ [the] lord - god of you, you shall worship
32393 ^ and him only you shall serve.’
32397 ^ he led also him to jerusalem
32402 ^ and set upon the pinnacle of the temple,
32409 ^ and said to him,
32412 ^ if [the] son you are
32415 ^ - of god,
32417 ^ cast yourself from here down.
32421 ^ it has been written for
32423 ^ -: to the angels of him he will give orders concerning you,
32430 ^ - to guard you;
32433 ^ and - in [their] hands will they bear you,
32439 ^ lest ever you strike against a stone the foot of you.’
32446 ^ and
32447 ^ answering, said to him - jesus
32452 ^ -, it has been said,
32454 ^ not you shall test [the] lord the god of you.’
32460 ^ and
32461 ^ having finished every temptation, the devil departed from him until an opportune time.
32471 ^ and returned - jesus in the power of the spirit to - galilee;
32483 ^ and a report went out into all the surrounding region concerning him.
32492 ^ and he was teaching in the synagogues of them,
32499 ^ being glorified by all.
32502 ^ and he came to nazareth,
32506 ^ where he had been
32508 ^ brought up;
32509 ^ and he entered
32511 ^ according to the custom to him, on the day of the sabbaths, into the synagogue,
32523 ^ and stood up
32525 ^ to read.
32526 ^ and there was given to him [the] scroll of the prophet isaiah,
32533 ^ and
32534 ^ having unrolled the scroll, he found the place
32540 ^ where it was
32542 ^ written:
32543 ^ [the] spirit of [the] lord [is] upon me,
32547 ^ of which because he has anointed me
32551 ^ to preach good news to [the] poor.
32553 ^ he has sent me
32555 ^ to proclaim to [the] captives deliverance, and to [the] blind recovery of sight,
32561 ^ to send forth
32562 ^ [the] oppressed in deliverance,
32565 ^ to proclaim [the] year of [the] lord’s favor.”
32569 ^ and
32570 ^ having rolled up the scroll,
32573 ^ having delivered [it] to the attendant, he sat down,
32577 ^ and of all the eyes
32581 ^ in the synagogue were
32585 ^ fixed upon him.
32587 ^ he began then
32589 ^ to say to them
32592 ^ -, today is fulfilled the scripture this, in the hearing of you.
32602 ^ and all were bearing witness to him
32606 ^ and marveling at the words of the grace
32613 ^ that are proceeding out of the mouth of him;
32619 ^ and they were saying,
32621 ^ not the son is
32624 ^ of joseph this?
32626 ^ and he said to them,
32630 ^ surely you will say to me the proverb this,
32636 ^ physician heal yourself!
32639 ^ whatsoever we have heard
32892 ^ having risen up then out of the synagogue, he entered into the house of simon.
32902 ^ [the] mother-in-law then
32904 ^ - of simon was
32907 ^ oppressed with a fever great;
32910 ^ and they appealed to him for her.
32915 ^ and
32916 ^ having stood over her, he rebuked the fever,
32922 ^ and it left her;
32925 ^ immediately then
32927 ^ having arisen, she began to serve them.
32930 ^ at the setting now of the sun,
32934 ^ all
32935 ^ as many as had [any]
32937 ^ ailing with diseases various, brought them to him,
32944 ^ - and
32946 ^ on one each of them, the hands having laid, he would heal them.
32954 ^ were going out now also demons from many,
32960 ^ crying out
32961 ^ and saying
32963 ^ -, you are the son - of god.
32970 ^ and
32971 ^ rebuking [them], not did he allow them
32975 ^ to speak,
32976 ^ because they knew
32978 ^ the christ him to be.
32982 ^ having arrived now daybreak,
32985 ^ having gone out, he went into a solitary place,
32990 ^ and the crowds were seeking him,
32995 ^ and they came up to him
32999 ^ and were detaining him,
33002 ^ of the not
33004 ^ to go from them.
33007 ^ - but he said to them
33012 ^ -,
33013 ^ also to the other towns to preach [the] good news me it behooves, of the kingdom - of god;
33024 ^ because for this have i been sent forth.
33028 ^ and he was
33030 ^ preaching in the synagogues - of judea.
33036 ^ it came to pass then
33038 ^ in - the crowd
33042 ^ pressing on him
33044 ^ also to hear the word of god,
33050 ^ and he was
33053 ^ standing by the lake of gennesaret,
33058 ^ and he saw two boats
33062 ^ lying by the lake;
33066 ^ - but
33068 ^ the fishermen
33069 ^ from them having gone out, were washing the nets.
33075 ^ having entered then into one of the boats,
33081 ^ which was simon’s, he asked him
33086 ^ from the land to put off a little.
33091 ^ having sat down then, from the boat he was teaching the crowds.
33099 ^ when then he left off
33102 ^ speaking,
33103 ^ he said to - simon,
33107 ^ put off into the deep
33111 ^ and let down the nets of you for a catch.
33118 ^ and
33119 ^ answering, simon said,
33122 ^ master,
33123 ^ through whole night having toiled, nothing have we taken;
33129 ^ at however
33131 ^ the word of you, i will let down the nets.
33137 ^ and
33138 ^ this having done, they enclosed a multitude of fishes great;
33144 ^ were breaking now the nets of them.
33149 ^ and they beckoned to the partners in the other boat,
33157 ^ -
33158 ^ having come,
33159 ^ to help them,
33161 ^ and they came
33163 ^ and filled both the boats
33168 ^ so that were sinking they.
33171 ^ having seen now, simon peter fell at the knees of jesus,
33179 ^ saying,
33180 ^ depart from me,
33183 ^ for a man sinful am i, lord.
33188 ^ amazement for laid hold on him, and on all those with him, at the catch of the fish
33202 ^ which they had taken,
33204 ^ likewise now also james and john, [the] sons of zebedee,
33212 ^ who were partners - with simon.
33217 ^ and said to - simon, - jesus,
33224 ^ not fear;
33226 ^ from - now on
33229 ^ men you will be catching.
33232 ^ and
33233 ^ having brought the boats to the land,
33239 ^ having left all, they followed him.
33243 ^ and it came to pass
33245 ^ in - being his in one of the cities,
33253 ^ that behold,
33255 ^ a man full of leprosy,
33258 ^ having seen then - jesus,
33262 ^ having fallen upon [his] face, begged him,
33267 ^ saying,
33268 ^ lord, if you would be willing,
33271 ^ you are able
33272 ^ me to cleanse.
33274 ^ and
33275 ^ having stretched out the hand, he touched him,
33280 ^ saying,
33281 ^ i am willing;
33282 ^ be you cleansed!
33283 ^ and immediately the leprosy departed from him.
33290 ^ and he ordered him
33294 ^ no one to tell:
33296 ^ but
33297 ^ having gone, show yourself to the priest,
33302 ^ and offer for the cleansing of you,
33308 ^ as commanded moses, for a testimony to them.
33314 ^ was spread abroad now still more the report concerning him;
33321 ^ and were coming crowds great
33325 ^ to hear
33326 ^ and to be healed from the sicknesses of them.
33332 ^ he himself now was
33335 ^ withdrawing into the wilderness
33339 ^ and praying.
33341 ^ and it came to pass on one of the days
33347 ^ that he was
33350 ^ teaching,
33351 ^ and there were
33353 ^ sitting by pharisees and teachers of the law,
33357 ^ who were
33359 ^ come out of every village - of galilee, and of judea, and of jerusalem.
33369 ^ and [the] power of [the] lord was [there]
33373 ^ for - to heal him.
33377 ^ and behold,
33379 ^ men
33380 ^ carrying upon a mat a man
33384 ^ who was
33386 ^ paralyzed,
33387 ^ and they were seeking
33389 ^ him to bring in
33391 ^ and to place him before him.
33396 ^ and
33397 ^ not having found
33399 ^ what way they should bring in him on account of the crowd,
33405 ^ having gone up on the housetop, through the tiles they let down him, with the mat into the midst before - jesus.
33423 ^ and
33424 ^ having seen the faith of them, he said,
33429 ^ man, have been forgiven you the sins of you.
33435 ^ and began
33437 ^ to reason the scribes and the pharisees,
33443 ^ saying,
33444 ^ who is this
33447 ^ who speaks blasphemies?
33450 ^ who is able
33452 ^ sins to forgive,
33454 ^ if not alone - god?
33459 ^ having known now - jesus the reasonings of them,
33466 ^ answering, he said to them,
33470 ^ why reason you in the hearts of you?
33476 ^ which is easier,
33479 ^ to say,
33480 ^ have been forgiven you the sins of you,
33485 ^ or to say,
33487 ^ arise
33488 ^ and walk?
33490 ^ that however you may know
33493 ^ that the son - of man authority has on the earth
33503 ^ to forgive sins...
33505 ^ he said
33506 ^ to the [one] having been paralyzed,
33508 ^ to you i say,
33510 ^ arise,
33511 ^ and having taken up the mat of you,
33516 ^ go to the house of you.
33521 ^ and immediately
33523 ^ having stood up before them,
33526 ^ having taken up
33527 ^ [that] on which he was lying, he departed to the home of him,
33535 ^ glorifying - god.
33538 ^ and amazement seized all,
33542 ^ and they were glorifying - god,
33546 ^ and were filled with fear,
33549 ^ saying
33550 ^ -, we have seen remarkable things today.
33554 ^ and after these things he went forth
33558 ^ and he saw a tax collector named levi
33563 ^ sitting at the tax booth;
33567 ^ and he said to him,
33570 ^ follow me.
33572 ^ and
33573 ^ having left all,
33575 ^ having arisen, he began to follow him.
33578 ^ and made a banquet great levi for him in the house of him,
33588 ^ and there was a multitude great of tax collectors and others,
33595 ^ who were with them
33599 ^ reclining.
33600 ^ and were grumbling the pharisees and the scribes of them at the disciples of him,
33612 ^ saying,
33613 ^ because of why with the tax collectors and sinners do you eat
33621 ^ and drink?
33623 ^ and
33624 ^ answering, - jesus said to them,
33630 ^ no need have
33633 ^ those being well
33635 ^ of a physician,
33636 ^ but
33637 ^ those sick
33639 ^ being.
33640 ^ not i have come
33642 ^ to call righteous [ones],
33644 ^ but sinners, to repentance.
33648 ^ - and they said to him,
33653 ^ the disciples of john fast often,
33658 ^ and prayers make,
33661 ^ likewise also those of the pharisees;
33666 ^ those however
33668 ^ of you eat
33670 ^ and drink.
33672 ^ - and
33674 ^ jesus said to them,
33678 ^ not are you able
33680 ^ the sons of the bridechamber
33684 ^ in which [time] the bridegroom with them is, to make
33692 ^ to fast?
33693 ^ will come however days
33696 ^ also when shall be taken away from them the bridegroom;
33703 ^ then they will fast in those - days.
33709 ^ he was speaking now also a parable to them
33715 ^ -: no one
33717 ^ a piece of a garment new having torn, puts [it] on a garment old;
33726 ^ if however otherwise
33729 ^ also the new he will tear,
33733 ^ and the old not will match, which [is] [the] piece - of the new.
33744 ^ and no one puts wine new into wineskins old;
33752 ^ if now otherwise,
33755 ^ will burst the wine - new the wineskins,
33762 ^ and it will be spilled out,
33765 ^ and the wineskins will be destroyed.
33769 ^ but wine new into wineskins fresh must be put.
33776 ^ and no one
33778 ^ having drunk old [wine] desires new;
33782 ^ he says for,
33784 ^ the old better is.
33788 ^ it came to pass then on a sabbath
33792 ^ is passing along he through grainfields,
33796 ^ and were plucking the disciples of him,
33801 ^ and were eating the heads of grain,
33805 ^ rubbing [them] in the hands.
33808 ^ some however
33810 ^ of the pharisees said,
33813 ^ why do you
33815 ^ that which not it is lawful [on] the sabbaths?
33820 ^ and
33821 ^ answering to them, said - jesus,
33827 ^ not even this have you read,
33830 ^ that which did david,
33833 ^ when was hungry he himself,
33836 ^ and those who with him
33840 ^ were:
33841 ^ how he entered into the house - of god,
33848 ^ and
33849 ^ the loaves of the presentation having taken, ate,
33855 ^ and gave to those with him,
34479 ^ fully trained however, everyone will be like the teacher of him.
34487 ^ why now look you at the splinter that [is] in the eye of the brother of you,
34499 ^ - and
34501 ^ the beam that [is] in the own eye not notice?
34509 ^ how are you able
34511 ^ to say to brother of you,
34515 ^ brother, let [that]
34517 ^ i might cast out the splinter that [is] in the eye of you,
34525 ^ yourself the in the eye of you beam not seeing?
34534 ^ hypocrite, cast out first the beam from the eye of you,
34543 ^ and then you will see clearly
34546 ^ the splinter - in the eye of the brother of you to cast out.
34556 ^ no for there is tree good,
34561 ^ producing fruit bad;
34564 ^ nor again a tree bad,
34568 ^ producing fruit good.
34571 ^ each for
34573 ^ tree by the own fruit is known.
34579 ^ not for from thorns do they gather figs,
34585 ^ nor from a bramble bush grapes gather they.
34590 ^ the good man, out of the good treasure of the [his] heart brings forth that which [is] good;
34602 ^ and the evil, out of the evil, brings forth that which [is] evil.
34611 ^ out of for
34613 ^ the abundance of his heart, speaks the mouth of him.
34619 ^ why now me do you call lord, lord,
34625 ^ and not do
34628 ^ what i say?
34630 ^ everyone who is coming to me,
34635 ^ and hearing of me the words,
34640 ^ and doing them,
34643 ^ i will show you
34645 ^ whom he is
34647 ^ like.
34648 ^ like he is
34650 ^ to a man
34651 ^ building a house,
34653 ^ who dug
34655 ^ and deepened,
34657 ^ and laid a foundation on the rock;
34663 ^ a flood then having come,
34666 ^ burst upon the stream the house that,
34672 ^ and not was able
34675 ^ to shake it,
34677 ^ because - well
34680 ^ had been built it.
34682 ^ the [one] however
34684 ^ having heard,
34685 ^ and not having done, like is
34690 ^ to a man
34691 ^ having built a house on the ground without a foundation,
34698 ^ on which burst the stream,
34702 ^ and immediately it fell,
34705 ^ and was the ruin of the house that great.
34713 ^ and when he had completed all the words of him in the hearing of the people,
34724 ^ he entered into capernaum.
34727 ^ of a centurion then
34729 ^ a certain servant,
34731 ^ sick being, was about
34734 ^ to die,
34735 ^ who was to him valued highly.
34739 ^ having heard then about - jesus, he sent to him elders of the jews,
34750 ^ begging him
34752 ^ that
34753 ^ having come, he might save the servant of him.
34865 ^ having heard then these things, - jesus marveled at him;
34872 ^ and
34873 ^ having turned to the
34875 ^ following him crowd, he said,
34879 ^ i say to you,
34881 ^ not even in - israel such great faith did i find.
34888 ^ and
34889 ^ having returned to the house,
34893 ^ those having been sent found the servant
34898 ^ in good health.
34899 ^ and it came to pass on the next [day],
34904 ^ he went into a town
34907 ^ called nain,
34909 ^ and were going with him the disciples of him, and a crowd great.
34918 ^ as then he drew near to the gate of the town,
34925 ^ also behold,
34927 ^ was being carried out
34928 ^ [one] having died, only begotten son of the mother of him;
34934 ^ and she was a widow.
34938 ^ and a crowd of the town, considerable, was with her.
34946 ^ and
34947 ^ having seen her, the lord was moved with compassion on her,
34954 ^ and said to her,
34957 ^ not weep.
34959 ^ and
34960 ^ having come up, he touched the bier;
35055 ^ having come then to him, the men said,
35062 ^ john the baptist has sent us to you,
35069 ^ saying,
35070 ^ you are
35072 ^ the coming [one],
35074 ^ or another are we to look for?
35077 ^ at that very - hour, he healed many of diseases, and afflictions, and spirits evil,
35090 ^ and to blind many he granted
35094 ^ to see.
35095 ^ and
35096 ^ answering, he said to them,
35099 ^ having gone, relate to john
35102 ^ what you have seen
35104 ^ and heard:
35106 ^ blind receive sight,
35108 ^ lame walk,
35110 ^ lepers are cleansed,
35112 ^ and deaf hear,
35115 ^ dead are raised,
35117 ^ poor are gospelized.
35119 ^ and blessed is
35122 ^ who if not shall be offended in me.
35128 ^ having departed then the messengers of john,
35133 ^ he began
35134 ^ to speak to the crowds concerning john:
35140 ^ what have you gone out into the wilderness to see?
35146 ^ a reed
35147 ^ by [the] wind shaken?
35150 ^ but
35151 ^ what have you gone out to see?
35154 ^ a man
35155 ^ in fine clothing arrayed?
35159 ^ behold,
35400 ^ having seen now the pharisee,
35404 ^ the [one] having invited him, he spoke within himself,
35410 ^ saying,
35411 ^ this,
35412 ^ if he were a prophet,
35415 ^ would have known -
35417 ^ who and what the woman [is]
35422 ^ who touches him,
35425 ^ for a sinner she is.
35428 ^ and
35429 ^ answering, - jesus said to him,
35435 ^ simon, i have
35437 ^ to you something to say.
35440 ^ - and,
35442 ^ teacher, say [it],
35444 ^ he says.
35445 ^ two debtors there were to a creditor certain;
35450 ^ the one owed denarii five hundred;
35455 ^ - and
35457 ^ the other, fifty.
35459 ^ nothing having they
35462 ^ to pay,
35463 ^ both he forgave.
35465 ^ which therefore
35467 ^ of them, more will love him?
35471 ^ answering, simon said,
35474 ^ i take it
35475 ^ that
35476 ^ [he] to whom the most he forgave.
35480 ^ - and he said to him,
35484 ^ rightly you have judged.
35486 ^ and
35487 ^ having turned to the woman, - to simon he was saying,
35494 ^ see you this the woman?
35498 ^ i entered of you into the house,
35503 ^ water of me for feet not you gave;
35509 ^ with her however - tears she wet my - feet,
35517 ^ and with [the] hair of her wiped [them].
35522 ^ a kiss to me not you gave;
35526 ^ she herself however,
35528 ^ from which [time] i came in, not has ceased
35533 ^ kissing my - feet.
35537 ^ with oil the head of me not you did anoint;
35543 ^ she herself however, with fragrant oil anointed the feet of me.
35550 ^ this therefore i say to you,
35554 ^ have been forgiven the sins of her - many,
35560 ^ for she loved much;
35747 ^ these things saying, he was calling out,
36057 ^ having come to [him] then, they awoke him,
36061 ^ saying,
36062 ^ master, master, we are perishing!
36065 ^ - and
36067 ^ having arisen, he rebuked the wind and the raging of the water,
36076 ^ and they ceased,
36078 ^ and there was a calm.
36081 ^ he said then to them,
36084 ^ where is the faith of you?
36088 ^ having been afraid then, they marveled,
36091 ^ saying to one another,
36094 ^ who then this is,
36098 ^ that even the winds he commands
36103 ^ and the water,
36106 ^ and they obey him?
36109 ^ and they sailed down to the region of the gerasenes,
36116 ^ which is opposite - galilee.
36121 ^ having gone forth then he upon the land,
36127 ^ met [him] a man certain out of the city,
36133 ^ having demons,
36135 ^ and time a long not was wearing clothing,
36141 ^ and in a house not did abide,
36146 ^ but in the tombs.
36150 ^ having seen then - jesus,
36154 ^ having cried out, he fell down before him,
36157 ^ and in a voice loud said,
36161 ^ what to me and to you, jesus, son - of god, the most high?
36171 ^ i implore of you
36173 ^ not me you might torment!
36176 ^ he was commanding for the spirit - unclean
36182 ^ to come out from the man.
36186 ^ many for
36188 ^ times it had seized him,
36191 ^ and he was bound, with chains and shackles
36196 ^ being kept;
36197 ^ and breaking the chains,
36201 ^ he was driven by the demon into the deserts.
36208 ^ asked now him - jesus,
36213 ^ what your name is?
36217 ^ - and he said,
36220 ^ legion,
36221 ^ because were entered demons many into him.
36227 ^ and they were begging him,
36230 ^ that not he would command them
36234 ^ into the abyss to go away.
36238 ^ there was now there a herd of pigs many
36244 ^ feeding, in the mountain,
36248 ^ and they begged him
36251 ^ that he would allow them
36254 ^ into them to enter;
36257 ^ and he allowed them.
36260 ^ having gone out then the demons from the man, they entered into the pigs,
36271 ^ and rushed the herd down the steep bank into the lake
36281 ^ and was drowned.
36283 ^ having seen then
36285 ^ those feeding [them]
36402 ^ when then - returned - jesus, received him the crowd;
36412 ^ they were for all
36415 ^ looking for him.
36417 ^ and behold,
36419 ^ came a man
36421 ^ whose name [was] jairus,
36424 ^ and he a ruler of the synagogue was,
36430 ^ and
36431 ^ having fallen at the feet - of jesus, he began begging him
36439 ^ to come to the house of him,
36444 ^ because daughter an only was to him,
36449 ^ about years [old] twelve,
36452 ^ and she was dying.
36455 ^ as then - went he, the crowds were pressing around him.
36464 ^ and a woman
36466 ^ being with a flux of blood for years twelve,
36473 ^ who on physicians having spent all her living,
36479 ^ neither was able
36481 ^ by no one to be healed,
36484 ^ having come behind, touched the fringe the of cloak of him,
36492 ^ and immediately stopped the flux of the blood of her.
36500 ^ and said - jesus,
36504 ^ who [is]
36505 ^ the [one] having touched me?
36508 ^ were denying [it] however all;
36511 ^ said - peter,
36514 ^ master, the people surround you
36519 ^ and press in.
36521 ^ - but
36523 ^ jesus said,
36525 ^ touched me someone;
36528 ^ i for know
36531 ^ power has gone out from me.
36535 ^ having seen then the woman
36539 ^ that not she was hid,
36542 ^ trembling she came,
36544 ^ and
36545 ^ having fallen down before him,
36547 ^ for what cause she touched him she declared before all the people,
36557 ^ and how she was healed immediately.
36561 ^ - and he said to her,
36565 ^ daughter, the faith of you has healed you;
36571 ^ go in peace.
36574 ^ still of him speaking,
36577 ^ comes one from the synagogue ruler,
36582 ^ saying
36583 ^ -, has died the daughter of you;
36588 ^ no longer trouble the teacher.
36592 ^ - but
36594 ^ jesus
36595 ^ having heard, answered him,
36598 ^ not fear;
36600 ^ only believe,
36602 ^ and she will be saved.
36604 ^ having entered then into the house, not he did allow
36611 ^ to go in anyone with him,
36615 ^ if not
36617 ^ peter, and john, and james, and the father of the child, and the mother.
36630 ^ they were weeping now all
36633 ^ and mourning for her.
36636 ^ - but he said,
36639 ^ not weep;
36641 ^ not for she is dead,
36644 ^ but sleeps.
36646 ^ and they were laughing at him,
36649 ^ knowing
36650 ^ that she was dead.
36652 ^ he now,
36654 ^ having taken hold of the hand of her, called out,
36659 ^ saying
36660 ^ -, child, arise!
36663 ^ and returned the spirit of her,
36668 ^ and she arose immediately;
36671 ^ and he directed to her
36674 ^ to be given
36675 ^ to eat.
36676 ^ and were amazed the parents of her;
36681 ^ - and he instructed them
36685 ^ no one to tell
36687 ^ what had happened.
36689 ^ having called together then the twelve, he gave to them power and authority over all the demons,
36702 ^ and diseases to heal,
36705 ^ and he sent them
36708 ^ to proclaim the kingdom - of god
36713 ^ and to heal the sick,
36717 ^ and he said to them,
36721 ^ nothing take for the journey;
36726 ^ neither staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money, nor apiece two tunics to have.
36739 ^ and into whatever -
36743 ^ house you might enter,
36745 ^ there remain,
36747 ^ and from there go forth.
36750 ^ and as many as - not might receive you,
36756 ^ going forth from the city that, the dust from the feet of you shake off, as a testimony against them.
36772 ^ going forth then, they were passing through the villages,
36778 ^ proclaiming the gospel
36779 ^ and healing everywhere.
36782 ^ heard of now herod the tetrarch
36787 ^ the things being done all,
36790 ^ and was perplexed,
36792 ^ because - it was said by some
36797 ^ - john has been raised out from [the] dead,
36802 ^ by some also
36805 ^ that elijah had appeared,
36808 ^ by others also
36810 ^ that a prophet one of the ancients had arisen.
36816 ^ said then herod,
36819 ^ john i beheaded;
36822 ^ who however is this
36826 ^ concerning whom i hear such things?
36830 ^ and he was seeking
36832 ^ to see him.
36834 ^ and
36835 ^ having returned, the apostles related to him
36840 ^ whatever they had done.
36842 ^ and
36843 ^ having taken them, he withdrew by himself into a town
36850 ^ called bethsaida.
36852 ^ the now
36854 ^ crowds
36855 ^ having known [it], followed him;
36858 ^ and
36859 ^ having received them, he was speaking to them concerning the kingdom - of god,
36868 ^ and
36869 ^ those need
36871 ^ having
36872 ^ of healing, he was healing.
36874 ^ - and
36876 ^ the day began
36878 ^ to decline;
36879 ^ having come then the twelve said to him,
36885 ^ dismiss the crowd,
36888 ^ that
36889 ^ having gone into the surrounding villages and countryside they might lodge,
36897 ^ and might find provisions;
36900 ^ for here in a desolate place we are.
36906 ^ he said now to them,
36910 ^ give to them you.
36913 ^ to eat
36914 ^ - but they said,
36917 ^ not there are to us more than loaves five, and fish two,
36927 ^ if not
36929 ^ having gone, we should buy for all the people this food.
36938 ^ they were for about men five thousand.
36943 ^ he said then to the disciples of him,
36949 ^ make sit down them, groups of about in fifty.
36955 ^ and they did so
36958 ^ and made sit down all.
36961 ^ having taken then the five loaves and the two fish,
36970 ^ having looked up to the heaven, he blessed them
36976 ^ and broke [them],
36978 ^ and he kept giving [them] to the disciples
36982 ^ to set before the crowd.
36985 ^ and they ate
36987 ^ and were satisfied all;
36990 ^ and was taken up
36992 ^ that having been a surplus to them of fragments, hand-baskets twelve.
36998 ^ and it came to pass
37000 ^ as - was he
37004 ^ praying in solitary,
37007 ^ were with him the disciples,
37011 ^ and he questioned them,
37014 ^ saying,
37268 ^ having awoken fully then they saw the glory of him, and the two men
37278 ^ - standing with him.
37281 ^ and it came to pass
37283 ^ in the departing of them from him,
37289 ^ said - peter to - jesus,
37295 ^ master, good it is
37298 ^ for us here to be;
37301 ^ also let us make tabernacles three: one for you, and one for moses, and one for elijah,
37313 ^ not knowing
37315 ^ what he is saying.
37317 ^ these things then as he is saying,
37321 ^ came a cloud
37323 ^ and was overshadowing them;
37326 ^ they feared then
37328 ^ in the entering of them into the cloud.
37335 ^ and a voice came out of the cloud,
37341 ^ saying,
37342 ^ this is the son of me,
37347 ^ - whom i have chosen;
37349 ^ him listen to!
37351 ^ and
37352 ^ as - occurred the voice, was found jesus alone.
37360 ^ and they were silent,
37363 ^ and to no one they told in those the days anything
37371 ^ of what they had seen.
37373 ^ it came to pass then the next day,
37378 ^ on having come down of them from the mountain,
37383 ^ met him a crowd great.
37387 ^ and behold,
37389 ^ a man from the crowd cried out,
37394 ^ saying,
37395 ^ teacher, i implore you
37398 ^ to look upon the son of me,
37403 ^ for an only child to me he is.
37407 ^ and behold,
37409 ^ a spirit takes him,
37412 ^ and suddenly he cries out,
37415 ^ and it throws into convulsions him with foaming,
37420 ^ and with difficulty it departs from him,
37425 ^ bruising him.
37427 ^ and i begged the disciples of you
37432 ^ that they might cast out it,
37435 ^ and not they were able.
37438 ^ answering now, - jesus said,
37443 ^ o generation unbelieving
37446 ^ and perverted, until when will i be with you
37453 ^ and bear with you?
37456 ^ bring here the son of you.
37461 ^ while then he was coming near of him,
37465 ^ threw down him the demon
37469 ^ and threw [him] into convulsions.
37471 ^ rebuked then - jesus the spirit - unclean,
37479 ^ and healed the boy,
37483 ^ and gave back him to father of him.
37489 ^ were astonished then all at the majesty - of god.
37497 ^ of all however wondering at all
37502 ^ which he did,
37504 ^ he said to the disciples of him,
37509 ^ let sink you into the ears of you the words these;
37518 ^ - for
37520 ^ the son - of man is about
37524 ^ to be betrayed into [the] hands of men.
37528 ^ - but they understand not the saying this,
37534 ^ and it was
37536 ^ veiled from them,
37539 ^ that not they should understand it.
37543 ^ and they were afraid
37545 ^ to ask him concerning the saying this.
37551 ^ came up then an argument among them,
37556 ^ this, who -
37559 ^ might be greatest of them.
37562 ^ - but
37564 ^ jesus,
37565 ^ having known the reasoning of the heart of them,
37571 ^ having taken hold of a child, set it by him,
37577 ^ and he said to them,
37611 ^ answering now, john said,
37615 ^ master, we saw someone
37618 ^ in the name of you casting out demons,
37624 ^ and we were forbidding him,
37627 ^ because not he follows with us.
37632 ^ said then to him - jesus,
37638 ^ not forbid;
37695 ^ having seen [it] now, the disciples james and john said,
37703 ^ lord, will you [that]
37705 ^ we should call
37706 ^ fire to come down from - heaven
37711 ^ and to consume them?”
37714 ^ having turned then, he rebuked them.
37718 ^ and they went to another village.
37723 ^ and going of them along the road,
37729 ^ said someone to him,
37733 ^ i will follow you
37735 ^ wherever if you may go.
37738 ^ and said to him - jesus,
37743 ^ the foxes holes have,
37747 ^ and the birds of the air nests;
37753 ^ - but
37755 ^ the son - of man not has
37760 ^ where the head he might lay.
37764 ^ he said then to another,
37768 ^ follow me.
37770 ^ - but he said,
37773 ^ lord allow me
37776 ^ having gone away, first, to bury the father of me.
37782 ^ he said then to him,
37785 ^ leave the dead
37788 ^ to bury - their own dead;
37792 ^ you however,
37794 ^ having gone forth, declare the kingdom - of god.
37800 ^ said then also another,
37804 ^ i will follow you, lord;
37807 ^ first however allow me
37811 ^ to bid farewell to those at the home of me.
37817 ^ said then to him - jesus,
37823 ^ no one
37824 ^ having laid the hand upon [the] plow,
37829 ^ and looking on the things behind, fit is
37836 ^ for the kingdom - of god.
37840 ^ after now
37842 ^ these things, appointed the lord others seventy two
37849 ^ and sent them in two [by] two before [the] face of himself into every city and place
37863 ^ where was about he himself
37866 ^ to go.
37867 ^ he was saying then to them,
37871 ^ the indeed
37873 ^ harvest [is] plentiful,
37875 ^ - but
37877 ^ the workmen [are] few.
37879 ^ pray earnestly to therefore the lord of the harvest,
37885 ^ that workmen he may send out into the harvest of him.
37892 ^ go;
37893 ^ behold,
37894 ^ i send forth you
37896 ^ as lambs in [the] midst of wolves.
37901 ^ neither carry purse,
37904 ^ nor bag,
37906 ^ nor sandals;
37908 ^ and no one on the road greet.
37914 ^ into whatever now - you might enter
37919 ^ house,
37920 ^ first say
37922 ^ peace to the house this.
37926 ^ and if there is a son of peace,
37932 ^ will rest upon him the peace of you;
37938 ^ if however not so,
37941 ^ to you it will return.
37944 ^ in the same now
37947 ^ - house remain,
37950 ^ eating
37951 ^ and drinking the things [supplied] by them;
37956 ^ worthy [is] for the workman
37960 ^ of the wages of him.
37963 ^ not move from house to house.
37969 ^ and into whatever -
37973 ^ city you might enter,
37975 ^ and they receive you,
37978 ^ eat
37979 ^ the things set before you.
37982 ^ and heal - in it [the] sick,
37988 ^ and say to them,
37991 ^ has drawn near to you the kingdom - of god.
37998 ^ into whatever now -
38002 ^ city you might enter,
38004 ^ and not they receive you,
38008 ^ having gone out into the streets of it, say,
38014 ^ even the dust
38017 ^ - having clung to us out of the city of you to the feet, we wipe off against you;
38029 ^ yet this know,
38032 ^ that has drawn near the kingdom - of god.
38038 ^ i say to you
38040 ^ that for sodom in the day that,
38046 ^ more tolerable it will be
38048 ^ than the city for that.
38052 ^ woe to you, chorazin!
38055 ^ woe to you, bethsaida!
38058 ^ for if in tyre and sidon had taken place the miracles
38067 ^ - having taken place in you,
38071 ^ long ago - in sackcloth and ashes sitting, they would have repented.
38079 ^ but for tyre and sidon, more tolerable will it be in the judgment
38088 ^ than for you.
38090 ^ and you, capernaum,
38093 ^ not to heaven will you be lifted up;
38097 ^ to - hades you will be brought down.
38394 ^ having taken [it] up, - jesus said,
38398 ^ a man certain was going down from jerusalem to jericho,
38405 ^ and robbers fell among,
38408 ^ who
38409 ^ both having stripped him,
38412 ^ and wounds having inflicted, went away,
38416 ^ having left [him] half dead.
38418 ^ by chance now a priest certain was going down on the road that,
38428 ^ and
38429 ^ having seen him he passed by on the opposite side.
38432 ^ likewise now also a levite
38436 ^ having come to the spot,
38440 ^ having come
38441 ^ and having seen [him], passed by on the opposite side.
38444 ^ a samaritan however,
38446 ^ one
38447 ^ journeying, came to him,
38451 ^ and
38452 ^ having seen was moved with compassion,
38454 ^ and
38455 ^ having approached, he bound up the wounds of him,
38460 ^ pouring on oil and wine;
38464 ^ having put then him on the own beast, he brought him to an inn
38475 ^ and took care of him.
38478 ^ and on the next day,
38482 ^ having taken out he gave [them] two denarii, to the innkeeper
38488 ^ and said,
38490 ^ take care of him,
38492 ^ and
38493 ^ whatever more - you might expend, of me
38498 ^ on - returning, i will repay you.
38536 ^ in now the proceeding of them, he entered into a village certain;
38546 ^ a woman now
38548 ^ certain named martha received him.
38553 ^ and she had
38556 ^ a sister
38557 ^ called mary,
38559 ^ who
38560 ^ also having sat down at the feet of the lord, was listening to the word of him.
38571 ^ - but
38573 ^ martha was distracted about much service;
38578 ^ having come up now, she said,
38581 ^ lord, not is it concerning to you
38585 ^ that the sister of me
38589 ^ alone me has left to serve?
38593 ^ speak therefore to her
38596 ^ that me she might help!
38599 ^ answering now, said to her the lord,
38605 ^ martha, martha, you are anxious
38608 ^ and troubled about many things;
38612 ^ one [thing] however is
38615 ^ necessary,
38616 ^ mary for the good portion has chosen,
38622 ^ which not will be taken away from her.
38626 ^ and it came to pass
38628 ^ in - being his in a place certain
38635 ^ praying,
38636 ^ when he ceased,
38638 ^ said one of the disciples of him to him,
38645 ^ lord, teach us
38648 ^ to pray,
38649 ^ as also john taught the disciples of him.
38656 ^ he said then to them,
38659 ^ when you pray,
38661 ^ say:
38662 ^ father, hallowed be the name of you.
38667 ^ come the kingdom of you.
38671 ^ the bread of us - daily give us
38678 ^ - each day.
38681 ^ and forgive us the sins of us,
38687 ^ also for ourselves we forgive
38691 ^ everyone indebted to us;
38694 ^ and not lead us into temptation.’”
38700 ^ and he said to them,
38704 ^ who among you will have a friend,
38709 ^ and will go to him at midnight
38714 ^ and say to him,
38717 ^ friend, lend me three loaves,
38722 ^ since a friend of my is come off a journey to me,
38730 ^ and nothing i have
38733 ^ what i will set before him.
38736 ^ and he
38737 ^ from within answering will say,
38740 ^ not me trouble cause;
38744 ^ already the door has been shut,
38748 ^ and the children of me with me in the bed are;
38758 ^ not i am able
38760 ^ having risen up, to give to you.
38763 ^ i say to you,
38765 ^ if even not he will give to him,
38770 ^ having risen up,
38771 ^ because of - being friend of him,
38776 ^ because of yet
38778 ^ the persistence of him,
38781 ^ having risen he will give him
38784 ^ as much as he needs.
38786 ^ and i to you say,
38789 ^ ask
38790 ^ and it will be given to you;
38793 ^ seek
38794 ^ and you will find;
38796 ^ knock
38797 ^ and it will be opened to you.
39091 ^ having lifted up one [her] voice,
39094 ^ a woman from the crowd said to him,
39100 ^ blessed [is] the womb
39103 ^ - having borne you, and [the] breasts
39108 ^ at which you nursed.
39110 ^ he then said,
39113 ^ no rather, blessed [are]
39115 ^ those hearing the word - of god
39121 ^ and keeping it.
39123 ^ of the now
39125 ^ crowds being pressed around together,
39127 ^ he began
39128 ^ to say,
39129 ^ the generation this, generation an evil is;
39135 ^ a sign it seeks after,
39137 ^ and a sign not will be given to it,
39142 ^ if not the sign of jonah.
39147 ^ as for was jonah to the ninevites a sign,
39154 ^ thus will be also the son - of man to the generation this.
39164 ^ the queen of [the] south will rise up in the judgment with the men of the generation this,
39176 ^ and will condemn them.
39179 ^ for she came from the ends of the earth
39186 ^ to hear the wisdom of solomon,
39190 ^ and behold,
39192 ^ greater than solomon here.
39195 ^ [the] men of nineveh will stand up in the judgment with the generation this,
39205 ^ and will condemn it.
39208 ^ for they repented at the preaching of jonah,
39214 ^ and behold,
39216 ^ greater than jonah [is] here.
39219 ^ but no one
39220 ^ a lamp having lit, in secret sets it,
39225 ^ nor under the basket,
39229 ^ but upon the lampstand,
39233 ^ that
39234 ^ those entering in the light may see.
39239 ^ the lamp of your body is the eye of you.
39247 ^ when the eye of you clear is,
39253 ^ also all the body of you light is;
39260 ^ when however evil it be,
39264 ^ also the body of you [is] dark.
39269 ^ take heed therefore,
39271 ^ lest the light that [is] in you darkness be.
39279 ^ if therefore the body of you [is] full of light,
39286 ^ not having part any dark,
39291 ^ it will be light all,
39294 ^ as when the lamp - shining might light you.
39302 ^ in then the speaking, asked him a pharisee
39309 ^ that he would dine with him,
39313 ^ having entered then, he reclined.
39316 ^ - and
39318 ^ the pharisee,
39319 ^ having seen [it], marveled
39321 ^ that not first he washed before the dinner.
39328 ^ said then the lord to him,
39334 ^ now you - pharisees, the outside of the cup and of the dish you cleanse,
39346 ^ - and
39348 ^ the inside of you is full of plundering and wickedness.
39354 ^ fools! [did] not
39356 ^ the [one] having made the outside, also the inside make?
39364 ^ but [of]
39365 ^ the things being within give alms,
39369 ^ and behold,
39371 ^ all things clean to you are.
39375 ^ but woe to you - pharisees,
39380 ^ for you pay tithes of - mint and - rue and every herb;
39390 ^ and you pass by the justice and the love - of god.
39440 ^ answering now, one of the lawyers says to him,
39447 ^ teacher,
39448 ^ these things saying, also us you insult.
39453 ^ - and he said,
39456 ^ also to you the lawyers, woe!
39461 ^ for you burden the men [with] burdens heavy to bear,
39467 ^ and yourselves with one of the fingers of you, not do touch the burdens.
39477 ^ woe to you,
39479 ^ for you build the tombs of the prophets,
39485 ^ - yet
39487 ^ the fathers of you killed them.
39491 ^ so witnesses you are,
39494 ^ and consent to the works of the fathers of you.
39501 ^ for they indeed killed them;
39506 ^ you now build [their tombs].
39509 ^ because of this also the wisdom - of god said,
39517 ^ i will send to them prophets and apostles,
39523 ^ and [some] of them they will kill
39527 ^ and persecute,
39529 ^ so that might be charged the blood of all the prophets
39536 ^ - having been poured out from [the] foundation of [the] world against the generation this, from the blood of abel to the blood of zechariah,
39551 ^ the [one] having perished between the altar and the house.
39559 ^ yes, i say to you,
39562 ^ it will be required of the generation this.
39567 ^ woe to you, the lawyers,
39571 ^ for you have taken away the key of the knowledge.
39577 ^ you yourselves not did enter,
39580 ^ and
39581 ^ those who are entering you hindered.
39584 ^ from there having gone forth of him,
39587 ^ began the scribes and the pharisees
39593 ^ urgently to press upon [him]
39595 ^ and to make speak him about many things,
39600 ^ watching him
39602 ^ to catch in something out of the mouth of him.
39608 ^ in these [times], having been gathered together the myriads of the crowd
39615 ^ so as to trample upon one another,
39618 ^ he began
39619 ^ to say to the disciples of him
39624 ^ first, take heed to yourselves of the leaven,
39630 ^ which is hypocrisy, of the pharisees.
39635 ^ nothing now
39637 ^ concealed up is,
39639 ^ which not will be revealed,
39642 ^ nor hidden
39644 ^ which not will be known.
39647 ^ instead, that
39649 ^ whatever in the darkness you have said, in the light will be heard;
39658 ^ and
39659 ^ what into the ear you have spoken in the inner rooms will be proclaimed upon the housetops.
39671 ^ i say now to you, those friends of me,
39677 ^ not you should fear
39679 ^ because of those killing the body
39684 ^ and after these things not being able
39689 ^ more abundantly anything to do.
39692 ^ i will show however you
39695 ^ whom you should fear:
39697 ^ fear
39698 ^ the [one who]
39699 ^ after the killing,
39702 ^ has authority
39704 ^ to cast into - hell.
39708 ^ yes, i say to you,
39711 ^ him fear.
39713 ^ not five sparrows are sold for assarion two?
39719 ^ and one of them not is
39725 ^ forgotten before - god.
39729 ^ but even the hairs of the head of you all have been numbered.
39738 ^ not fear,
39740 ^ than many sparrows you are more valuable.
39743 ^ i say now to you,
39746 ^ everyone who - will confess in me before the men,
39755 ^ also the son - of man will confess in him before the angels - of god;
40466 ^ fire i came to cast upon the earth,
40472 ^ and how i wish
40475 ^ if already it be kindled!
40478 ^ baptism however i have
40481 ^ to be baptized [with],
40482 ^ and how i am distressed
40485 ^ until while it should be accomplished!
40488 ^ think you
40489 ^ that
40490 ^ peace i came to give on the earth?
40496 ^ no,
40497 ^ i say to you,
40499 ^ but rather division.
40502 ^ there will be for from - now five in one house
40511 ^ divided,
40512 ^ three against two,
40515 ^ and two against three.
40519 ^ they will be divided father against son
40523 ^ and son against father,
40527 ^ mother against - daughter
40531 ^ and daughter against - mother,
40536 ^ mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law of her
40541 ^ and daughter-in-law against - mother-in-law.
40546 ^ he was saying now also to the crowds,
40551 ^ when you see a cloud
40555 ^ rising up from [the] west,
40558 ^ immediately you say
40560 ^ -, a shower is coming,
40563 ^ and it happens so.
40566 ^ and when a south wind
40569 ^ is blowing,
40570 ^ you say
40571 ^ -, heat there will be,
40574 ^ and it happens.
40576 ^ hypocrites!
40577 ^ the appearance of the earth and of the sky you know [how] to discern;
40848 ^ having seen then her, - jesus called [her] near
40854 ^ and said to her,
40857 ^ woman, you have been freed from the sickness of you.
40862 ^ and he laid upon her the hands,
40867 ^ and immediately she was made straight
40870 ^ and began to glorify - god.
40874 ^ answering now the ruler of the synagogue,
40878 ^ indignant
40879 ^ because on the sabbath had healed - jesus, he was saying to the crowd
40888 ^ -, six days there are
40896 ^ in these therefore coming be healed,
40901 ^ and not on the day of the sabbath.
40907 ^ answered therefore him the lord
40912 ^ and said,
40914 ^ hypocrites! each one of you on the sabbath, not does he untie the ox of him, or the donkey, from the stall,
40930 ^ and
40931 ^ having led [it] away, give [it] to drink?
40933 ^ this now,
40997 ^ which having taken, a man cast into garden his;
41004 ^ and it grew
41006 ^ and came into a tree,
41010 ^ and the birds of the air encamped in the branches of it.
41020 ^ and again he said,
41023 ^ to what shall i liken the kingdom - of god?
41029 ^ like it is
41031 ^ to leaven,
41032 ^ which having taken, a woman hid in of meal measures three
41040 ^ until it was leavened all.
41044 ^ and he was going through by towns and villages,
41050 ^ teaching,
41051 ^ and progress making toward jerusalem.
41056 ^ said then one to him,
41060 ^ lord, if [are] few
41063 ^ those being saved?
41065 ^ - and he said to them,
41070 ^ strive
41071 ^ to enter in through the narrow door;
41076 ^ for many,
41078 ^ i say to you, will seek
41081 ^ to enter in,
41082 ^ and not will be able.
41085 ^ from what - shall have risen up the master of the house,
41091 ^ and shall have shut the door,
41095 ^ then you should begin
41097 ^ outside to stand
41099 ^ and to knock at the door,
41103 ^ saying,
41104 ^ lord, open to us.
41107 ^ and
41108 ^ he answering, will say to you,
41111 ^ not i do know you,
41114 ^ from where are.
41116 ^ then will you begin
41118 ^ to say,
41119 ^ we ate in presence of you
41122 ^ and drank,
41124 ^ and in the streets of us you taught.
41130 ^ and he will say,
41132 ^ i tell you,
41134 ^ not i do know you
41137 ^ from where you are;
41139 ^ depart from me, all [you] workers of unrighteousness.
41145 ^ there will be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth
41154 ^ when you see abraham, and isaac, and jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom - of god; you however
41226 ^ having gone, say to the fox that,
41231 ^ behold,
41232 ^ i cast out demons,
41234 ^ and cures i complete today and tomorrow,
41240 ^ and the third [day] i am perfected.
41244 ^ but it behooves
41246 ^ me today and tomorrow
41250 ^ and the [day] following to proceed;
41254 ^ for not it is possible [for]
41257 ^ a prophet to perish outside of jerusalem.
41261 ^ jerusalem, jerusalem,
41263 ^ - killing the prophets,
41267 ^ and stoning
41269 ^ those having been sent to her, how often i have wanted
41275 ^ to gather those children of you,
41279 ^ that way a hen [gathers] - her brood under the wings,
41288 ^ and not you were willing.
41291 ^ behold,
41292 ^ is left to you the house of you.
41297 ^ i say now to you,
41300 ^ no not shall you see me
41304 ^ until [the time] comes
41306 ^ when you say,
41452 ^ having gone, recline in the last place,
41458 ^ so that when might come
41461 ^ the [one] having invited you,
41464 ^ he will say to you,
41466 ^ friend, come up higher.
41469 ^ then will be to you glory
41473 ^ before all those reclining [with] you.
41478 ^ for
41479 ^ everyone - exalting himself will be humbled,
41484 ^ and
41485 ^ the [one] humbling himself will be exalted.
41489 ^ he was saying then also
41492 ^ to the [one] having invited him,
41495 ^ when you make a dinner or a supper,
41500 ^ not call - friends of you, nor the brothers of you, nor the relatives of you, nor neighbors rich,
41516 ^ lest ever also they should invite in return you,
41521 ^ and be made recompense to you.
41525 ^ but when a feast you make,
41529 ^ call the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind;
41534 ^ and blessed you will be,
41537 ^ because nothing they have
41540 ^ to repay you.
41542 ^ it will be recompensed for to you in the resurrection of the righteous.
41550 ^ having heard then one
41553 ^ of those reclining with [him]
41555 ^ these things, he said to him,
41558 ^ blessed [is he]
41559 ^ who will eat bread in the kingdom - of god.
41567 ^ - but he said to him,
41571 ^ a man certain was preparing a supper great,
41576 ^ and invited many.
41579 ^ and he sent the servant of him at the hour of the supper
41588 ^ to say
41589 ^ to those having been invited,
41591 ^ come,
41592 ^ for now ready [it] is.
41596 ^ and began with one [voice] all
41601 ^ to excuse themselves.
41602 ^ the first said to him,
41606 ^ a field i have bought,
41608 ^ and i have need
41611 ^ going out to see it;
41614 ^ i beg of you,
41616 ^ hold me
41618 ^ excused.
41619 ^ and another said,
41622 ^ yoke of oxen i have bought
41625 ^ five,
41626 ^ and i am going
41628 ^ to prove them;
41630 ^ i beg of you
41632 ^ hold me
41634 ^ excused.
41635 ^ and another said,
41638 ^ a wife i have married,
41640 ^ and because of this not i am able
41645 ^ to come.
41646 ^ and
41647 ^ having come, the servant reported to the master of him these things.
41655 ^ then
41656 ^ having become angry, the master of the house said to servant of him,
41663 ^ go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city,
41672 ^ and the poor and crippled and blind and lame bring in here.
41683 ^ and said the servant,
41687 ^ sir, it has been done
41689 ^ as you did command,
41691 ^ and still room there is.
41695 ^ and said the master to the servant,
41702 ^ go out into the highways and hedges
41708 ^ and compel [them]
41710 ^ to come in,
41711 ^ so that may be filled of me the house.
41716 ^ i say for to you
41719 ^ that not one the men of those
41724 ^ - having been invited will taste of me the supper.
41730 ^ were going with then him crowds great;
41735 ^ and
41736 ^ having turned, he said to them,
41740 ^ if anyone comes to me,
41745 ^ and not hates the father of himself and the mother and the wife and the children and the brothers and the sisters, yes, and even the life of him,
41772 ^ not he is able
41774 ^ to be of me disciple.
41777 ^ whoever not carries the cross of himself
41783 ^ and comes after me, not is able
41789 ^ to be my disciple.
41792 ^ which for
41794 ^ of you,
41796 ^ desiring
41797 ^ a tower to build, not first
41801 ^ having sat down, counts the cost,
41805 ^ whether he has for [its] completion?
41809 ^ thus not ever he having laid of it a foundation,
41814 ^ and not being able
41817 ^ to finish,
41869 ^ an embassy having sent, he asks - for peace.
41875 ^ so therefore every one of you
41880 ^ who not does give up
41883 ^ all that he himself possesses, not is able
41889 ^ to be my disciple.
41892 ^ good [is] therefore the salt;
41896 ^ if however even the salt becomes tasteless,
41902 ^ with what will it be seasoned?
41905 ^ neither for soil nor for manure fit is it;
41913 ^ out they cast it.
41931 ^ to hear him.
41933 ^ and were grumbling the both pharisees and the scribes,
41941 ^ saying
41942 ^ -, this [man] sinners receives
41946 ^ and eats with them.
41949 ^ he spoke then to them the parable this,
41956 ^ saying,
41957 ^ what man of you,
41961 ^ having a hundred sheep,
41964 ^ and having lost of them one, not leaves the ninety nine in the open field,
41977 ^ and goes
41979 ^ after the [one] having been lost,
41982 ^ until he finds it?
41985 ^ and
41986 ^ having found [it], he lays [it] on the shoulders of him,
41992 ^ rejoicing.
41993 ^ and
41994 ^ having come to the house, he calls together the friends and the neighbors,
42004 ^ saying to them,
42006 ^ rejoice with me,
42008 ^ for i have found the sheep of me,
42013 ^ the [one] having been lost!
42015 ^ i say to you
42017 ^ that in the same way joy in - heaven there will be over one sinner
42027 ^ repenting, rather than over ninety nine righteous ones,
42033 ^ who no need have
42037 ^ of repentance.
42038 ^ or what woman,
42041 ^ drachmas having
42043 ^ ten,
42044 ^ if she should lose drachma one,
42048 ^ not lights a lamp
42051 ^ and sweeps the house,
42055 ^ and seeks carefully
42058 ^ until it she finds?
42061 ^ and
42062 ^ having found [it], she calls together the friends and neighbors,
42068 ^ saying,
42069 ^ rejoice with me,
42071 ^ for i have found the drachma
42075 ^ that i lost.
42077 ^ thus
42078 ^ i say to you, there is joy before the angels - of god over one sinner
42090 ^ repenting.
42091 ^ he said then,
42093 ^ a man certain had two sons.
42098 ^ and said the younger of them to [the] father,
42105 ^ father, give to me the
42109 ^ falling [to me] portion of the property.
42113 ^ - and he divided between them the property.
42119 ^ and after not many days,
42124 ^ having gathered together all, the younger son went away into a country distant,
42133 ^ and there he wasted the estate of him,
42139 ^ living prodigally.
42141 ^ having spent however of him all,
42145 ^ there arose a famine severe throughout the country that,
42152 ^ and he began
42155 ^ to be in need.
42156 ^ and
42157 ^ having gone, he joined himself to one of the citizens the country of that,
42165 ^ and he sent him into the fields of him
42172 ^ to feed pigs.
42174 ^ and he was longing
42176 ^ to be filled from the pods
42180 ^ that were eating the pigs;
42184 ^ and no one was giving to him.
42188 ^ to himself however having come, he was saying,
42193 ^ how many hired servants of the father of me have abundance of bread,
42200 ^ i however with hunger here am perishing?
42205 ^ having risen up, i will go to the father of me,
42211 ^ and i will say to him,
42214 ^ father, i have sinned against - heaven and before you;
42222 ^ no longer am i worthy
42225 ^ to be called son of you.
42228 ^ make me like one of the servants of you.
42235 ^ and
42236 ^ having risen up, he went to the father of himself.
42242 ^ still now he far being distant,
42247 ^ saw him the father of him,
42252 ^ and was moved with compassion,
42254 ^ and
42255 ^ having run, fell upon the neck of him
42261 ^ and kissed him.
42264 ^ said then the son to him,
42269 ^ father, i have sinned against - heaven and before you;
42277 ^ no longer am i worthy
42280 ^ to be called son of you.
42283 ^ said then the father to the servants of him,
42291 ^ quickly bring out robe the best
42296 ^ and clothe him,
42299 ^ and give a ring for the hand of him,
42306 ^ and sandals for his feet;
42311 ^ and having brought the calf - fattened,
42317 ^ kill [it],
42318 ^ and
42319 ^ having eaten, let us be merry.
42321 ^ for this - son of mine dead was,
42328 ^ and is alive again;
42330 ^ he was
42331 ^ lost,
42332 ^ and is found.
42334 ^ and they began
42336 ^ to be merry.
42337 ^ was now the son of him, the elder, in [the] field;
42346 ^ and while
42348 ^ coming [up], he drew near to the house,
42352 ^ he heard music and dancing.
42356 ^ and
42357 ^ having called near one of the servants, he began inquiring
42362 ^ what - might be these things.
42366 ^ - and he said to him
42370 ^ -, the brother of you is come,
42375 ^ and has killed the father of you the calf - fattened,
42384 ^ because
42385 ^ in good health him he has received.
42388 ^ he was angry however,
42390 ^ and not was willing
42393 ^ to go in.
42394 ^ - and
42396 ^ the father of him,
42398 ^ having gone, was begging him.
42401 ^ - and
42403 ^ answering, he said to [the] father of him,
42408 ^ behold,
42409 ^ so many years i serve you,
42413 ^ and never a commandment of you i disobeyed,
42418 ^ and to me never did you give a young goat,
42423 ^ that with the friends of me i might make merry.
42429 ^ when however the son of you this,
42435 ^ the [one] having devoured your - living with prostitutes, came,
42443 ^ you have killed for him the fattened calf!
42448 ^ - and he said to him,
42452 ^ son, you always with me are,
42458 ^ and all that [is] mine, yours is.
42464 ^ to make merry however
42466 ^ and to rejoice it was fitting,
42469 ^ because the brother of you this, dead was,
42476 ^ and is alive again;
42478 ^ and
42479 ^ he was lost,
42480 ^ and is found.
42482 ^ he was saying now also to the disciples,
42488 ^ a man certain there was rich,
42492 ^ who had a manager,
42495 ^ and he was accused unto him
42499 ^ as is wasting
42501 ^ the possessions of him.
42504 ^ and
42505 ^ having called him, he said to him,
42509 ^ what [is]
42510 ^ this i hear concerning you?
42514 ^ give the account of the stewardship of you;
42520 ^ not for you are able
42523 ^ any longer to manage.
42525 ^ said then within himself the manager,
42531 ^ what shall i do,
42533 ^ for the master of me is taking away the management from me?
43198 ^ immediately having come, recline?
43201 ^ but not will he say to him,
43205 ^ prepare
43206 ^ what i may eat,
43208 ^ and
43209 ^ having girded yourself about, serve me
43212 ^ while i eat
43214 ^ and drink;
43216 ^ and after these things shall eat
43220 ^ and drink you?’
43223 ^ not is he thankful to the servant
43228 ^ because he did
43230 ^ the things having been commanded?
43232 ^ thus also you,
43235 ^ when you may have done all
43238 ^ the [things] having been commanded you, say
43242 ^ -, servants unworthy are we;
43292 ^ having gone, show yourselves to the priests.
43297 ^ and it came to pass
43299 ^ in the going them,
43303 ^ they were cleansed.
43304 ^ one then
43306 ^ of them,
43308 ^ having seen
43309 ^ that he was healed, turned back,
43312 ^ with a voice loud glorifying - god,
43318 ^ and he fell on [his] face at the feet of him,
43326 ^ giving thanks to him;
43328 ^ and he was a samaritan.
43332 ^ having answered then, - jesus said,
43337 ^ not the ten were cleansed?
43341 ^ - but
43343 ^ the nine are where?
43345 ^ none was there found
43347 ^ having returned to give glory - to god,
43352 ^ if not the foreigner this?
43357 ^ and he said to him,
43360 ^ having risen up go forth;
43362 ^ the faith of you has cured you!”
43367 ^ having been asked now by the pharisees
43372 ^ when is coming the kingdom - of god, he answered them
43380 ^ and said,
43382 ^ not comes the kingdom - of god with careful observation,
43390 ^ nor will they say,
43392 ^ behold here,
43394 ^ or there.
43396 ^ behold for,
43398 ^ the kingdom - of god in the midst of you is.”
43405 ^ he said then to the disciples,
43410 ^ will come days
43412 ^ when you will desire
43414 ^ one of the days of the son - of man to see,
43422 ^ and not you will see [it].
43425 ^ and they will say to you,
43428 ^ behold there,
43430 ^ or behold here.
43433 ^ not go forth
43435 ^ nor follow.
43437 ^ as for the lightning
43441 ^ flashing from the [one end] of the sky to the [other end] of the sky shines,
43452 ^ thus will be the son - of man in the day of him.
43462 ^ first however it behooves
43465 ^ him many things to suffer,
43468 ^ and to be rejected by the generation this.
43474 ^ and as it came to pass in the days of noah,
43481 ^ thus will it be also in the days of the son of man:
43491 ^ they were eating,
43492 ^ they were drinking,
43493 ^ they were marrying,
43494 ^ they were being given in marriage,
43495 ^ until that day entered noah into the ark,
43503 ^ and came the flood
43507 ^ and destroyed all.
43510 ^ likewise, as it came to pass in the days of lot,
43517 ^ they were eating,
43518 ^ they were drinking,
43519 ^ they were buying,
43520 ^ they were selling,
43521 ^ they were planting,
43522 ^ they were building;
43523 ^ in that then day went out lot from sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
43536 ^ and destroyed all.
43539 ^ according - to these will it be
43543 ^ in that day the son - of man is revealed.
43550 ^ in that - day,
43554 ^ the [one who] will be on the housetop,
43559 ^ and the goods of him in the house, not let him come down
43568 ^ to take away them;
43570 ^ and the [one] in [the] field, likewise not let him return to the things behind.
43580 ^ remember the wife of lot!
43713 ^ because yet
43715 ^ - causes me trouble the widow this, i will avenge her,
43724 ^ so that not
43726 ^ to end coming, she exhaust me.
43731 ^ said then the lord,
43735 ^ hear
43736 ^ what the judge - unrighteous says.
43742 ^ - and
43744 ^ god no not shall execute the avenging of the elect of him,
43753 ^ the [ones] crying out to him day and night,
43759 ^ and be deferring in regard to them?
43763 ^ i say to you
43765 ^ that he will execute the avenging of them in quickness.
43772 ^ nevertheless, the son - of man
43777 ^ having come, indeed will he find - faith on the earth?
43785 ^ he spoke now also to some
43790 ^ - trusting in themselves
43794 ^ that they are righteous,
43797 ^ and despising the others, the parable this:
43804 ^ men two went up into the temple
43810 ^ to pray,
43811 ^ the one a pharisee,
43814 ^ and the other a tax collector.
43818 ^ the pharisee,
43820 ^ having stood, toward himself thus was praying,
43825 ^ - god, i thank you
43829 ^ that not i am like the rest of the men — swindlers, unrighteous, adulterers —
43840 ^ or even like this - tax collector.
43846 ^ i fast twice in the week;
43850 ^ i tithe all things,
43852 ^ as many as i gain.
43854 ^ - but
43856 ^ the tax collector,
43857 ^ afar off standing, not was willing
43861 ^ not even the eyes to lift up to - heaven,
43868 ^ but was striking the breast of himself,
43873 ^ saying
43874 ^ -, god, be merciful to me, the sinner!
43880 ^ i say to you,
43882 ^ went down this one
43884 ^ justified to the house of him, rather than that.
43891 ^ for everyone
43893 ^ - exalting himself will be humbled;
43911 ^ having seen however, the disciples were rebuking them.
43917 ^ - but
43919 ^ jesus, having called to [him] them,
43922 ^ said,
43923 ^ permit the little children
43926 ^ to come to me,
43929 ^ and not do forbid them;
43933 ^ of the for
43935 ^ such is the kingdom - of god.
43941 ^ truly i say to you,
44014 ^ having heard then, - jesus said to him,
44020 ^ yet one thing to you is lacking:
44024 ^ all,
44025 ^ as much as you have, sell,
44028 ^ and distribute to [the] poor,
44031 ^ and you will have treasure in the heavens;
44037 ^ and come,
44039 ^ follow me.
44041 ^ - and
44043 ^ having heard these things, very sorrowful he became;
44047 ^ he was for rich extremely.
44051 ^ having seen then him, - jesus
44056 ^ sorrowful became, saying,
44059 ^ how difficultly
44061 ^ those - riches
44064 ^ having, into the kingdom - of god shall enter.
44071 ^ easier for it is
44074 ^ a camel through an eye of a needle to go,
44079 ^ than
44080 ^ a rich man into the kingdom - of god to enter.
44087 ^ said then
44089 ^ those having heard,
44091 ^ then who is able
44094 ^ to be saved?
44095 ^ - but he said,
44098 ^ the things impossible with men, possible with - god are.
44107 ^ said then - peter,
44111 ^ behold,
44112 ^ we
44113 ^ having left the own, followed you.
44118 ^ - and he said to them,
44122 ^ truly i say to you
44125 ^ that no one there is
44128 ^ who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom - of god,
44144 ^ who no nothing shall receive manifold more in the time this —
44153 ^ and in the age
44157 ^ that is coming, life eternal.
44161 ^ having taken aside then the twelve, he said to them,
44168 ^ behold,
44169 ^ we go up to jerusalem,
44172 ^ and will be accomplished all things
44175 ^ - having been written by the prophets about the son - of man.
44184 ^ he will be betrayed for to the gentiles,
44188 ^ and will be mocked,
44190 ^ and will be insulted,
44192 ^ and will be spit upon.
44194 ^ and
44195 ^ having flogged [him], they will kill him;
44198 ^ and on the day - third he will rise again.
44204 ^ and they none of these things understood;
44209 ^ and was the word this
44214 ^ hidden from them,
44217 ^ and neither they knew
44220 ^ the things being spoken.
44222 ^ it came to pass then
44224 ^ in the drawing near of him to jericho,
44230 ^ a blind [man] certain was sitting beside the road,
44236 ^ begging.
44237 ^ having heard now a crowd
44240 ^ passing along, he was asking
44242 ^ what might be this.
44245 ^ they told then him
44248 ^ -, jesus of nazareth is passing by.
44253 ^ and he called out
44255 ^ saying,
44256 ^ jesus, son of david, have mercy on me.
44261 ^ and
44262 ^ those going before were rebuking him,
44266 ^ that he should be silent.
44268 ^ he however much more kept crying out,
44273 ^ son of david, have mercy on me.
44277 ^ having stopped then, - jesus commanded
44282 ^ him to be brought to him.
44286 ^ having drawn near then him,
44289 ^ he asked him,
44387 ^ having looked up, - jesus said to him,
44393 ^ zacchaeus,
44394 ^ having hurried come down;
44423 ^ having stood then, zacchaeus said to the lord,
44430 ^ behold,
44431 ^ the half
44433 ^ of me of the possessions, lord, to the poor i give;
44440 ^ and if of anyone anything i have defrauded,
44445 ^ i restore [it] fourfold.
44447 ^ said then to him - jesus
44453 ^ -, today salvation to the house this has come,
44460 ^ because also he a son of abraham is.
44466 ^ came for the son - of man
44472 ^ to seek
44473 ^ and to save
44475 ^ that having been lost.
44477 ^ were hearing while they these things,
44481 ^ having proceeded, he spoke a parable,
44484 ^ because - near
44487 ^ being
44488 ^ jerusalem of his,
44490 ^ and thinking their
44493 ^ that immediately is about the kingdom - of god
44500 ^ to appear.
44501 ^ he said therefore,
44503 ^ a man certain of noble birth proceeded to a country distant,
44510 ^ to receive for himself a kingdom
44513 ^ and to return.
44515 ^ having called then ten servants of himself, he gave to them ten minas
44524 ^ and said to them,
44528 ^ do business
44529 ^ until that i come back.
44532 ^ - but
44534 ^ the citizens of him hated him
44538 ^ and sent a delegation after him,
44543 ^ saying,
44544 ^ not we are willing [for]
44546 ^ this [man] to reign over us.
44550 ^ and it came to pass
44552 ^ on the returning of him,
44556 ^ having received the kingdom,
44559 ^ that he directed
44561 ^ to be called to him the servants these
44566 ^ to whom he had given the money,
44570 ^ in order that he might know
44572 ^ what they had gained by trading.
44574 ^ came up then the first,
44578 ^ saying,
44579 ^ lord, the mina of you, ten has produced
44585 ^ more minas.
44586 ^ and he said to him,
44589 ^ well done, good servant!
44592 ^ because in very little, faithful you were,
44597 ^ to be
44598 ^ having authority you are
44600 ^ over ten cities.
44603 ^ and came the second,
44607 ^ saying,
44608 ^ the mina of you, lord, has made five minas.
44615 ^ he said then also to this one,
44619 ^ and you over are to be
44623 ^ five cities.
44625 ^ and - another came,
44629 ^ saying,
44630 ^ lord, behold
44632 ^ the mina of you,
44728 ^ from however the [one] not
44732 ^ having, even
44734 ^ that which he has will be taken away.
44737 ^ furthermore, the enemies of mine these,
44742 ^ those not
44744 ^ having been willing [for]
44745 ^ me to reign over them, bring here
44751 ^ and slay them before me.
44756 ^ and
44757 ^ having said these things he went on ahead,
44761 ^ going up to jerusalem.
44764 ^ and it came to pass
44766 ^ as he drew near to bethphage and bethany, toward the mount
44775 ^ - called olivet,
44778 ^ he sent two of the disciples,
44782 ^ saying,
44783 ^ go into the ahead village,
44788 ^ in which
44790 ^ entering you will find a colt
44793 ^ having been tied,
44794 ^ on which no one ever yet
44798 ^ of men has sat;
44800 ^ and
44801 ^ having untied it, bring [it].
44804 ^ and if anyone you asks,
44809 ^ because of why do you untie [it]?
44812 ^ thus will you say,
44814 ^ because the lord of it need has.’
44820 ^ having departed then,
44822 ^ those having been sent found [it]
44825 ^ as he had said to them.
44828 ^ on untying then of them the colt,
44833 ^ said the masters of it to them,
44839 ^ why untie you the colt?
44843 ^ - and they said
44846 ^ -, the lord of it need has.
44852 ^ and they led it to - jesus,
44858 ^ and
44859 ^ having cast their - garments on the colt, they put on [it] - jesus.
44869 ^ going then of him,
44872 ^ they were spreading the garments of them on the road.
44879 ^ drawing near then of him already at the descent of the mount - of olives,
44890 ^ began all the multitude of the disciples,
44896 ^ rejoicing, to praise - god in a voice loud for all
44904 ^ which they had seen [the] mighty works,
44907 ^ saying:
44952 ^ having seen the city, he wept over it,
44958 ^ saying
44959 ^ -, if you had known in the day this, even you, the things for peace!
44971 ^ now however they are hidden from eyes of you.
44977 ^ for will come days upon you
44982 ^ that will cast around the enemies of you a barricade you;
44989 ^ and they will surround you
44992 ^ and will hem in you on every side,
44996 ^ and will level to the ground you and the children of you within you,
45005 ^ and not will leave a stone upon a stone within you,
45013 ^ in place of which not you knew the season the of visitation of you.
45022 ^ and
45023 ^ having entered into the temple, he began
45028 ^ to cast out
45029 ^ those selling,
45031 ^ saying to them,
45033 ^ it has been written:
45034 ^ and will be the house of me a house of prayer.’
45041 ^ you however it have made a den of robbers.’
45047 ^ and he was
45049 ^ teaching - every day in the temple;
45056 ^ the however
45058 ^ chief priests and the scribes were seeking
45063 ^ him to destroy,
45065 ^ and the foremost of the people.
45070 ^ and not they found
45073 ^ - what they might do;
45076 ^ the people for
45079 ^ all were hanging on
45081 ^ his [words], listening.
45083 ^ and it came to pass on one of the days,
45089 ^ as was teaching he the people in the temple
45096 ^ and proclaiming the gospel,
45098 ^ came up the chief priests and the scribes with the elders
45107 ^ and spoke,
45109 ^ saying to him,
45112 ^ tell us
45114 ^ by what authority these things you do,
45119 ^ or who is
45122 ^ the [one] having given to you the authority this?
45128 ^ answering now, he said to them,
45133 ^ will ask you i also one thing,
45137 ^ and you tell me:
45140 ^ the baptism of john, from heaven was it,
45146 ^ or from men?
45149 ^ - and they reasoned among themselves,
45154 ^ saying
45155 ^ -, if we should say
45158 ^ from heaven,
45160 ^ he will say,
45161 ^ because of why not did you believe him?
45166 ^ if however we should say,
45169 ^ from men,
45171 ^ the people all will stone us;
45284 ^ having seen now him, the farmers began reasoning among themselves,
45292 ^ saying,
45293 ^ this is the heir;
45297 ^ let us kill him,
45299 ^ so that ours might become the inheritance.
45304 ^ and
45305 ^ having cast forth him outside the vineyard, they killed [him].
45311 ^ what therefore will do to them the master of the vineyard?
45319 ^ he will come
45320 ^ and will destroy the farmers these,
45325 ^ and will give the vineyard to others.
45330 ^ having heard [it], then they said,
45333 ^ never may it be!
45335 ^ - but
45337 ^ having looked at them, he said,
45340 ^ what then is
45343 ^ that has been written this:
45346 ^ [the] stone
45347 ^ which rejected
45349 ^ those building,
45351 ^ this has become into [the] head of [the] corner’
45356 ^ everyone
45357 ^ - falling on that - stone will be broken;
45364 ^ on whomever but - it might fall,
45369 ^ it will grind into powder him.
45371 ^ and sought the scribes and the chief priests
45378 ^ to lay on him - hands in that - hour;
45387 ^ and they feared the people;
45391 ^ they perceived for
45393 ^ that against them he was speaking the parable this.
45400 ^ and
45401 ^ having watched [him], they sent spies,
45404 ^ feigning
45405 ^ themselves righteous to be,
45408 ^ that they might catch him in talk,
45412 ^ in order to deliver him to the rule and to the authority of the governor.
45422 ^ and they questioned him,
45425 ^ saying,
45426 ^ teacher, we know
45428 ^ that rightly you speak
45431 ^ and teach,
45433 ^ and not receive [any] person,
45437 ^ but on the basis of truth the way - of god teach.
45445 ^ is it lawful
45446 ^ for us to caesar tribute to give,
45450 ^ or not?
45452 ^ having perceived however of them the craftiness, he said to them,
45460 ^ show me a denarius.
45463 ^ of whom has it
45465 ^ [the] image and inscription?
45468 ^ - and they said,
45471 ^ caesar’s.
45472 ^ - and he said to them,
45477 ^ therefore give back the things of caesar to caesar,
45482 ^ and the things - of god - to god.
45488 ^ and not they were able
45491 ^ to catch him in his word before the people;
45497 ^ and
45498 ^ having marveled at the answer of him, they became silent.
45504 ^ having approached then some of the sadducees,
45509 ^ the ones denying
45511 ^ a resurrection not there is, they questioned him,
45516 ^ saying,
45517 ^ teacher, moses wrote to us
45521 ^ if anyone’s brother should die
45525 ^ having a wife,
45527 ^ and he childless is,
45531 ^ that should take the brother of him the wife
45538 ^ and should raise up seed to the brother of him.
45544 ^ seven therefore
45546 ^ brothers there were;
45548 ^ and the first,
45551 ^ having taken a wife, died childless;
45555 ^ and the second,
45558 ^ and the third took her;
45563 ^ likewise then also the seven
45568 ^ not did leave children,
45571 ^ and died.
45573 ^ finally also the woman died.
45578 ^ the woman therefore, in the resurrection, of which of them does she become
45587 ^ wife?
45588 ^ - for
45590 ^ the seven had her as wife.
45594 ^ and said to them - jesus,
45599 ^ the sons of the age this marry
45605 ^ and are given in marriage;
45674 ^ answering now, some of the scribes said,
45680 ^ teacher, well you have spoken.
45683 ^ no longer then did they dare
45686 ^ to ask him anything.
45689 ^ he said then to them,
45693 ^ how do they declare
45695 ^ the christ to be of david son?
45700 ^ himself for
45702 ^ david says in [the] book of psalms:
45707 ^ said [the] lord to the lord of me,
45712 ^ sit at [the] right hand of me,
45716 ^ until - i place the enemies of you, [as] a footstool of the feet of you.”’
45726 ^ david therefore lord him calls,
45731 ^ and how of him son is he?
45736 ^ were listening now all the people,
45741 ^ he said to the disciples of him,
45745 ^ beware of the scribes,
45749 ^ - desiring
45751 ^ to walk in long robes,
45754 ^ and loving greetings in the marketplaces, and first seats in the synagogues, and first places in the banquets;
45770 ^ who devour the houses of widows,
45776 ^ and as a pretext at great length pray.
45780 ^ these will receive more abundant condemnation.
45784 ^ having looked up now, he saw the ones
45788 ^ casting into the treasury the gifts of them rich.
45796 ^ he saw then a certain widow poor
45801 ^ casting in lepta two.
45805 ^ and he said,
45807 ^ truly i say to you
45810 ^ that the widow this - poor, more than all has cast in;
45819 ^ all for
45821 ^ these
45822 ^ out of that which was abounding to them cast in the gifts;
45830 ^ she however, out of the poverty of her, all the livelihood
45839 ^ that she had did cast.
45842 ^ and as some were speaking about the temple,
45848 ^ that with stones goodly and consecrated gifts it was adorned,
45854 ^ he said,
45855 ^ [as to] these things
45856 ^ which you are beholding,
45858 ^ will come [the] days
45860 ^ in which not will be left stone upon stone
45867 ^ which not will be thrown down.
45870 ^ they asked then him,
45873 ^ saying,
45874 ^ teacher, when then these things will be,
45879 ^ and what [will be] the sign
45883 ^ when are about these things
45886 ^ to take place?
45887 ^ - and he said,
45890 ^ take heed,
45891 ^ lest you be led astray;
45893 ^ many for will come in the name of me,
45900 ^ saying,
45901 ^ i am [he],
45903 ^ and the time is drawn near.
45907 ^ not go after them.
45911 ^ when then you should hear of wars and commotions,
45917 ^ not be terrified;
45919 ^ it behooves for
45921 ^ these things to take place first,
45924 ^ but not immediately [is] the end.
45929 ^ then he was saying to them,
45932 ^ will rise up nation against nation,
45936 ^ and kingdom against kingdom.
45940 ^ earthquakes both great, and in different places famines and pestilences there will be;
45950 ^ fearful sights also and from heaven signs great will there be.
45958 ^ before however
45960 ^ these things all, they will lay upon you the hands of them,
45968 ^ and will persecute [you],
45970 ^ delivering [you] to the synagogues and prisons,
46230 ^ looking [on them] for yourselves, you know
46234 ^ that already near the summer is.
46240 ^ so also you,
46243 ^ when you see these things
46246 ^ coming to pass, know
46248 ^ that near is the kingdom - of god.
46255 ^ truly i say to you,
46258 ^ that no not will have passed away the generation this,
46265 ^ until - all [these things] shall have taken place.
46269 ^ the heaven and the earth will pass away,
46275 ^ - but
46277 ^ the words of me no not will pass away.
46282 ^ take heed now to yourselves,
46285 ^ lest ever be burdened of you the hearts with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of life —
46297 ^ and would come upon you suddenly the day that as a snare.
46307 ^ it will come for
46309 ^ upon all those sitting upon the face of all the earth.
46318 ^ watch also at every season,
46323 ^ praying
46324 ^ that you may have strength
46326 ^ to escape these things all
46329 ^ that are about
46331 ^ to come to pass
46332 ^ and to stand before the son - of man.
46339 ^ he was now
46341 ^ during the day in the temple teaching,
46347 ^ - and
46349 ^ the evening
46350 ^ going out, he was lodging on the mount
46355 ^ - called olivet.
46358 ^ and all the people would come early in the morning to him in the temple
46368 ^ to hear him.
46370 ^ was drawing near now the feast of unleavened [bread],
46376 ^ - called passover.
46379 ^ and were seeking the chief priests and the scribes
46386 ^ - how they might put to death him;
46390 ^ they were afraid for of the people.
46394 ^ entered then satan into judas,
46399 ^ the [one] being called iscariot,
46402 ^ being of the number of the twelve.
46408 ^ and
46409 ^ having gone away, he spoke with the chief priests and captains,
46415 ^ the how to them he might betray him.
46420 ^ and they rejoiced
46422 ^ and agreed
46424 ^ him money to give.
46427 ^ and he promised,
46429 ^ and began seeking opportunity
46432 ^ - to betray him apart from [a] crowd to them.
46438 ^ came then the day of unleavened [bread]
46456 ^ having gone, prepare for us the passover,
46461 ^ that we might eat [it].
46463 ^ - and they said to him,
46524 ^ having gone then, they found [it]
46527 ^ as he had said to them;
46530 ^ and they prepared the passover.
46534 ^ and when was come the hour,
46539 ^ he reclined,
46540 ^ and the apostles with him.
46545 ^ and he said to them,
46549 ^ with desire i have desired
46551 ^ this - passover to eat with you
46557 ^ before - i
46560 ^ suffer.
46561 ^ i say for to you
46564 ^ that never not will i eat thereof,
46569 ^ until when it is fulfilled in the kingdom - of god.
46577 ^ and
46578 ^ having received [the] cup,
46580 ^ having given thanks, he said,
46582 ^ take this,
46584 ^ and divide [it] among yourselves.
46588 ^ i say for to you,
46591 ^ that no not will i drink from - now of the fruit of the vine,
46603 ^ until that the kingdom - of god shall come.
46610 ^ and
46611 ^ having taken [the] bread,
46613 ^ having given thanks, he broke [it]
46615 ^ and gave to them,
46618 ^ saying,
46619 ^ this is the body of me,
46624 ^ which for you
46627 ^ is given;
46628 ^ this do in the of me remembrance,
46634 ^ and the cup likewise
46638 ^ after which having supped,
46641 ^ saying,
46642 ^ this - cup [is] the new covenant in the blood of me,
46970 ^ having come then to the place, he said to them,
46977 ^ pray
46978 ^ not to enter into temptation.
46982 ^ and he withdrew from them about a stone’s throw,
46990 ^ and
46991 ^ having fallen on the knees, he was praying,
46995 ^ saying,
46996 ^ father, if you are willing,
46999 ^ take away this - cup from me.
47005 ^ yet not the will of me,
47010 ^ but - of you be done.
47014 ^ appeared then to him an angel from heaven,
47020 ^ strengthening him.
47022 ^ and
47023 ^ having been in agony, more earnestly he was praying.
47028 ^ and became the sweat of him like great drops of blood,
47036 ^ falling down upon the ground.
47040 ^ and
47041 ^ having risen up from the prayer,
47045 ^ having come to the disciples, he found sleeping them from the grief,
47055 ^ and he said to them,
47058 ^ why are you sleeping?
47060 ^ having risen up pray,
47062 ^ that not you might enter into temptation.
47067 ^ while still of him speaking,
47070 ^ behold,
47071 ^ a crowd,
47072 ^ and he who is called judas,
47076 ^ one of the twelve, was going before them,
47081 ^ and he drew near - to jesus
47085 ^ to kiss him.
47087 ^ jesus then said to him,
47091 ^ judas, with a kiss the son - of man are you betraying?
47098 ^ having seen then those around him
47128 ^ answering now, - jesus said,
47133 ^ allow you as far as thus!
47136 ^ and
47137 ^ having touched the ear, he healed him.
47142 ^ said then jesus to those
47147 ^ having come out against him, chief priests, and captains of the temple, and elders,
47157 ^ as against a robber have you come out with swords and clubs?
47165 ^ every day being of me with you in the temple,
47174 ^ not did you stretch out the hands against me;
47180 ^ but this is of you the hour, and the power of the darkness.
47191 ^ having seized then him, they led [him] away,
47195 ^ and led [him] into the house of the high priest.
47202 ^ - and
47204 ^ peter was following afar off.
47207 ^ they having kindled then a fire in [the] midst of the courtyard,
47214 ^ and having sat down together,
47216 ^ was sitting - peter among them.
47221 ^ having seen then
47223 ^ him a servant girl certain
47226 ^ sitting by the light,
47230 ^ and having looked intently on him, she said,
47234 ^ also this one with him was.
47239 ^ - but he denied [it],
47242 ^ saying,
47243 ^ not i do know him, woman.
47247 ^ and after a little, another
47251 ^ having seen him, was saying,
47254 ^ also you of them are.
47259 ^ - but
47261 ^ peter was saying,
47263 ^ man, not i am.
47266 ^ and having elapsed about hour one,
47271 ^ other a certain strongly affirmed [it],
47274 ^ saying,
47275 ^ of a truth, also this one with him was;
47282 ^ also for a galilean he is.
47286 ^ said however - peter,
47290 ^ man, not i know
47293 ^ what you say.
47295 ^ and immediately
47297 ^ while he was speaking of him, crowed the rooster.
47302 ^ and
47303 ^ having turned, the lord looked at - peter,
47309 ^ and remembered - peter the word of the lord,
47317 ^ how he had said to him
47320 ^ -,
47321 ^ before [the] rooster
47323 ^ crows today, you will deny me three times.
47328 ^ and
47329 ^ having gone forth outside, he wept bitterly.
47333 ^ and the men
47336 ^ who are holding him began mocking him,
47341 ^ beating [him].
47342 ^ and
47343 ^ having blindfolded him, they were questioning [him],
47346 ^ saying,
47347 ^ prophesy,
47348 ^ who is
47350 ^ the [one] having struck you?
47353 ^ and other things many,
47356 ^ blaspheming, they were saying to him.
47360 ^ and when it became day,
47364 ^ were gathered together the elderhood of the people, chief priests both and scribes,
47373 ^ and they led him into the council of them,
47380 ^ saying,
47381 ^ if you are the christ,
47386 ^ tell us.
47388 ^ he said then to them,
47391 ^ if you i should tell,
47394 ^ no not would you believe;
47397 ^ if then i should ask [you],
47400 ^ no not would you answer.
47403 ^ from - now on also will be the son - of man
47412 ^ sitting at [the] right hand of the power - of god.
47419 ^ they said then all,
47422 ^ you then are the son - of god?
47429 ^ - and to them he was saying,
47434 ^ you say
47436 ^ that i am.
47439 ^ - and they said,
47442 ^ what any more have we of witness need?
47447 ^ we ourselves for have heard [it] from the mouth of him.
47454 ^ and
47455 ^ having risen up, all the multitude of them led him to - pilate.
47465 ^ they began then
47467 ^ to accuse him,
47469 ^ saying,
47470 ^ this [man] we found
47472 ^ misleading the nation of us
47476 ^ and forbidding
47478 ^ tribute to caesar to be given,
47481 ^ and declaring
47483 ^ himself christ, a king, to be.
47487 ^ - and
47489 ^ pilate questioned him,
47492 ^ saying,
47493 ^ you are the king of the jews?
47499 ^ - and
47501 ^ answering him, he was saying,
47504 ^ you say.
47506 ^ - and
47508 ^ pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds,
47516 ^ not find i
47518 ^ guilt in the man this.
47523 ^ - but they kept insisting,
47526 ^ saying
47527 ^ -, he stirs up the people,
47531 ^ teaching throughout all - of judea,
47536 ^ and he has begun from - galilee even to here.
47543 ^ pilate now
47545 ^ having heard, asked
47547 ^ whether the man a galilean is,
47552 ^ and
47553 ^ having learned
47554 ^ that from the jurisdiction of herod he is, he sent up him to herod,
47564 ^ being also he himself in jerusalem in those - days.
47573 ^ - and
47575 ^ herod,
47576 ^ having seen - jesus, [was] glad exceedingly;
47581 ^ he was for of a long time
47586 ^ wishing
47587 ^ to see him,
47589 ^ because of - hearing concerning him;
47594 ^ and he was hoping
47596 ^ some sign to see
47720 ^ having chastised therefore him, i will release [him].”
47724 ^ they cried out however all together,
47727 ^ saying,
47728 ^ away with this [man],
47730 ^ release now to us - barabbas,
47735 ^ who was
47737 ^ on account of insurrection a certain
47740 ^ having been made in the city, and murder, having been cast into the prison.
47750 ^ again therefore - pilate called to them,
47756 ^ wishing
47757 ^ to release - jesus.
47760 ^ - but they were crying out,
47763 ^ saying,
47764 ^ crucify,
47765 ^ crucify him.
47767 ^ - and a third [time] he said to them,
47773 ^ what for
47775 ^ evil did commit this [man]?
47778 ^ no cause of death found i in him.
47784 ^ having chastised therefore him, i will release [him].
47788 ^ - but they were urgent, with voices loud,
47793 ^ asking for
47794 ^ him to be crucified.
47796 ^ and were prevailing the voices of them.
47801 ^ and pilate sentenced
47804 ^ to be done the demand of them.
47808 ^ he released then
47810 ^ the [one] on account of insurrection and murder
47815 ^ having been cast into prison,
47818 ^ whom they had asked for;
47820 ^ - and
47822 ^ jesus he delivered to the will of them.
47827 ^ and as they led away him,
47831 ^ having laid hold on simon, a certain of cyrene,
47835 ^ coming from the country, they put upon him the cross,
47842 ^ to carry behind - jesus.
47846 ^ were following now him a great multitude of the people, and of women,
47855 ^ who were mourning
47857 ^ and lamenting for him.
47860 ^ having turned then to them, - jesus said,
47867 ^ daughters of jerusalem, not weep for me,
47873 ^ but for yourselves weep,
47877 ^ and for the children of you.
47882 ^ for behold,
47884 ^ are coming days
47886 ^ in which they will say,
47889 ^ blessed [are] the barren, and the wombs
47895 ^ that never did bear, and breasts
47900 ^ that never nursed.
47903 ^ then they will begin
47905 ^ to say to the mountains,
47908 ^ fall upon us,
47911 ^ and to the hills,
47914 ^ cover us.”’
47916 ^ for if in the green tree, these things they do;
47924 ^ in the dry, what might take place?
47929 ^ were being led away now also other criminals two,
47935 ^ with him to be put to death.
47938 ^ and when they came to the place
47944 ^ - called the skull,
47947 ^ there they crucified him, and the criminals,
47953 ^ one - on [the] right;
47957 ^ one now on [the] left.
47961 ^ - and
47963 ^ jesus was saying,
47965 ^ father, forgive them,
47968 ^ not for they know
47971 ^ what they do.”
47973 ^ dividing then the garments of him, they cast lots.
47980 ^ and stood the people
47984 ^ beholding.
47985 ^ were deriding [him] then also the rulers,
47990 ^ saying,
47991 ^ others he saved;
47993 ^ let him save himself
47995 ^ if this is the christ - of god, the chosen [one].
48004 ^ mocked then him also the soldiers,
48010 ^ coming near,
48011 ^ sour wine offering him,
48014 ^ and saying,
48016 ^ if you are the king of the jews,
48023 ^ save yourself!
48025 ^ there was now also an inscription over him,
48031 ^ the king of the jews this.
48036 ^ one now
48038 ^ of the
48039 ^ having been hanged criminals was railing at him,
48043 ^ saying
48044 ^ not you are if the christ?
48049 ^ save yourself and us!
48053 ^ answering now, the other
48057 ^ was rebuking him, saying,
48060 ^ not even do fear you - god,
48065 ^ that under the same judgment you are,
48071 ^ and we indeed justly?
48075 ^ worthy for
48150 ^ this now having said, he breathed his last.
48154 ^ having seen now the centurion
48270 ^ having followed then, the women
48274 ^ who were
48276 ^ come out of - galilee with him, saw the tomb
48284 ^ and how was laid the body of him.
48290 ^ having returned then, they prepared spices and anointing oils.
48296 ^ and on the indeed
48299 ^ sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
48304 ^ the however
48306 ^ first [day] of the week, dawn very early, to the tomb they came,
48315 ^ bringing
48316 ^ that they had prepared spices.
48319 ^ they found then the stone
48323 ^ having been rolled away from the tomb.
48327 ^ having entered however, not they found the body of the lord jesus.
48336 ^ and it came to pass
48338 ^ while - are perplexed they about this,
48344 ^ that behold,
48346 ^ men two stood by them in garments
48352 ^ dazzling.
48353 ^ terrified then having become of them
48357 ^ and bowing the faces to the ground,
48364 ^ they said to them,
48367 ^ why seek you
48369 ^ the living among the dead?
48374 ^ not he is here,
48377 ^ but he is risen!
48379 ^ remember
48380 ^ how he spoke to you,
48383 ^ yet being in - galilee,
48388 ^ saying,
48389 ^ the son - of man - it behooves
48395 ^ to be delivered into hands of men sinful,
48400 ^ and to be crucified,
48402 ^ and the third day to arise.
48407 ^ and they remembered the words of him.
48412 ^ and
48413 ^ having returned from the tomb, they related these things all to the eleven and to all the rest.
48426 ^ it was now - magdalene mary, and joanna, and mary the [mother] of james, and the other women with them,
48442 ^ telling to the apostles these things.
48447 ^ and appeared before them like folly the words of them,
48456 ^ and they did not believe them.
48459 ^ - but
48461 ^ peter,
48462 ^ having risen up, ran to the tomb,
48467 ^ and
48468 ^ having stooped down, he sees the linen strips only,
48473 ^ and he went away, in himself
48477 ^ wondering at
48478 ^ that having come to pass.
48480 ^ and behold,
48482 ^ two of them on same the day were
48490 ^ going to a village
48493 ^ being distant, stadia sixty from jerusalem,
48498 ^ whose name [is] emmaus;
48501 ^ and they were talking with one another about all -
48509 ^ having taken place these things.
48511 ^ and it came to pass
48513 ^ in the talking of them
48517 ^ and reasoning,
48519 ^ that himself jesus,
48522 ^ having drawn near, was walking along with them;
48525 ^ - but
48527 ^ the eyes of them were held
48530 ^ - not
48532 ^ to know him.
48534 ^ he said then to them,
48538 ^ what - words [are] these
48542 ^ that you exchange with one another
48546 ^ walking?
48547 ^ and they stood still, looking sad.
48550 ^ answering now, [the] one named cleopas said to him,
48558 ^ you alone visit jerusalem
48562 ^ and not have known
48565 ^ the things having come to pass in it in the days these?
48573 ^ and he said to them,
48576 ^ what things?
48577 ^ - and they said to him,
48581 ^ the things concerning jesus of nazareth,
48586 ^ who was a man, a prophet mighty in deed and word before - god and all the people;
48602 ^ that then delivered up him the chief priests and the rulers of us to [the] judgment of death,
48615 ^ and crucified him.
48618 ^ we however were hoping
48621 ^ - he it is
48624 ^ who is about
48626 ^ to redeem - israel.
48629 ^ but indeed also with all these things, [the] third this day brings,
48639 ^ away from which these things came to pass.
48643 ^ however also women certain out from us astonished us.
48651 ^ having been early to the tomb
48656 ^ and not having found the body of him, they came
48663 ^ declaring
48664 ^ also a vision of angels to have seen,
48668 ^ who say
48670 ^ he is alive.
48672 ^ and went some of those with us to the tomb
48681 ^ and found [it] so,
48684 ^ as also the women said;
48689 ^ him however not they saw.
48693 ^ and he said to them,
48698 ^ o foolish and slow - of heart
48704 ^ - to believe in all
48708 ^ that have spoken the prophets. not
48713 ^ these things was it necessary for
48715 ^ to suffer the christ
48718 ^ and to enter into the glory of him?
48724 ^ and
48725 ^ having begun from moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.
48742 ^ and they drew near to the village
48747 ^ where they were going,
48749 ^ and he appeared
48752 ^ farther to be going.
48754 ^ and they constrained him,
48757 ^ saying,
48758 ^ abide with us,
48761 ^ for toward evening it is,
48765 ^ and has declined now the day.
48770 ^ and he entered in
48772 ^ - to abide with them.
48776 ^ and it came to pass
48778 ^ in the reclining of him with them,
48784 ^ having taken the bread he blessed [it],
48788 ^ and
48789 ^ having broken [it], he began giving [it] to them.
48792 ^ of them then were opened
48795 ^ the eyes,
48797 ^ and they knew him.
48800 ^ and he vanished being seen from them.
48806 ^ and they said to one another,
48810 ^ not the heart of us
48814 ^ burning was within us
48818 ^ as he was speaking with us on the road,
48824 ^ as he was opening to us the scriptures?
48829 ^ and
48830 ^ having risen up [that] same - hour, they returned to jerusalem,
48837 ^ and they found
48839 ^ gathered together the eleven and those with them,
48846 ^ saying
48847 ^ -, indeed has risen the lord
48852 ^ and he has appeared to simon.
48855 ^ and they began relating the things on the road,
48862 ^ and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.
48871 ^ these things now of them as they were telling, he himself stood in midst of them
48880 ^ and says to them,
48883 ^ peace to you.
48885 ^ having been terrified however,
48887 ^ and filled with fear having been, they were thinking [themselves]
48891 ^ a spirit to see.
48893 ^ and he said to them,
48896 ^ why
48897 ^ troubled are you,
48899 ^ and through why doubts do come up in the hearts of you?
48908 ^ see the hands of me and the feet of me,
48916 ^ that i am
48919 ^ he. touch me
48922 ^ and see,
48924 ^ for a spirit flesh and bones not has,
48931 ^ as me you see
49765 ^ having looked at him, - jesus said,
49770 ^ you are simon the son of john;
49776 ^ you will be called cephas
49779 ^ which means peter.
49782 ^ on the next day he desired
49785 ^ to go forth into - galilee.
49789 ^ and he finds philip.
49792 ^ and says to him - jesus,
49797 ^ follow me.
49799 ^ was now - philip from bethsaida, from the city of andrew and peter.
49811 ^ finds philip - nathanael
49815 ^ and says to him,
49818 ^ [him] whom wrote of moses in the law,
49824 ^ also the prophets, we have found,
49828 ^ jesus son - of joseph, - of nazareth.
49835 ^ and said to him nathanael,
49883 ^ before - you philip
49887 ^ calling,
49888 ^ being under the fig tree, i saw you.
49894 ^ answered him nathanael,
49897 ^ rabbi, you are the son - of god;
49904 ^ you king are
49907 ^ - of israel.
49909 ^ answered jesus
49911 ^ and said to him,
49914 ^ because i said to you
49917 ^ that i saw you under the fig tree,
49923 ^ believe you?
49924 ^ greater things than these you will see.
49927 ^ and he says to him,
49930 ^ truly, truly, i say to all of you,
49934 ^ you will see the heaven
49937 ^ opened and the angels - of god
49943 ^ ascending
49944 ^ and descending on the son - of man.”
49951 ^ and on the day - third a wedding took place in cana - of galilee,
49962 ^ and was the mother - of jesus there.
49969 ^ was invited then also - jesus and the disciples of him to the wedding.
49981 ^ and having been deficient of wine,
49984 ^ says the mother - of jesus to him,
49991 ^ wine not they have.
49994 ^ and says to her - jesus,
49999 ^ what to me and to you, woman?
50004 ^ not yet is come the hour of me.
50009 ^ says the mother of him to the servants,
52062 ^ in which now am going i, another before me descends.
52071 ^ says to him - jesus,
52075 ^ arise,
52076 ^ take up the mat of you,
52080 ^ and walk.
52082 ^ and immediately became well the man,
52088 ^ and he took up the mat of him
52093 ^ and began to walk.
52095 ^ it was now sabbath on that - day.
52102 ^ were saying therefore the jews
52106 ^ to the [one] having been healed,
52108 ^ sabbath it is,
52110 ^ and not it is lawful for you
52114 ^ to take up the mat of you,
52118 ^ who however answered them,
53044 ^ having rowed therefore about stadia twenty five or thirty, they see - jesus
53055 ^ walking on the sea,
53059 ^ and near the boat coming,
53064 ^ and they were frightened.
53066 ^ - and he says to them,
53070 ^ i am [he];
53072 ^ not fear.
53074 ^ they were willing then
53076 ^ to receive him into the boat,
53081 ^ and immediately was the boat at the land
53089 ^ to which they were going.
53092 ^ on the next day the crowd
53096 ^ - standing on the other side of the sea, having seen
53102 ^ that boat other no was there
53108 ^ if not one,
53111 ^ and that not went with the disciples of him - jesus into the boat,
53123 ^ but alone the disciples of him went away;
53129 ^ but other came boats from tiberias, near the place
53137 ^ where they ate the bread,
53141 ^ having given thanks the lord.
53144 ^ when therefore saw the crowd
53149 ^ that jesus not is there,
53154 ^ nor the disciples of him,
53158 ^ they entered themselves into the boats
53163 ^ and came to capernaum,
53167 ^ seeking - jesus.
53170 ^ and having found him on the other side of the sea,
53176 ^ they said to him,
53178 ^ rabbi, when here have you come?
53182 ^ answered them - jesus
53186 ^ and said,
53188 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
53192 ^ you seek me,
53194 ^ not because you saw signs,
53198 ^ but because you ate of the loaves
53204 ^ and were satisfied.
53206 ^ work not [for] the food
53210 ^ that is perishing,
53212 ^ but [for] the food
53215 ^ - enduring unto life eternal,
53220 ^ which the son - of man to you will give.
53227 ^ him for the father has sealed,
53232 ^ - god.
53234 ^ they said therefore to him,
53238 ^ what must we do,
53240 ^ that we may be doing the works - of god?
53246 ^ answered - jesus
53249 ^ and said to them,
53252 ^ this is the work - of god,
53258 ^ that you should believe
53260 ^ in him whom has sent he.
53264 ^ they said therefore to him,
53267 ^ what then do you
53271 ^ [as a] sign,
53272 ^ that we may see
53274 ^ and may believe you?
53277 ^ what work do you perform?
53279 ^ the fathers of us the manna ate in the wilderness,
53288 ^ as it is
53290 ^ written:
53291 ^ bread from - heaven he gave them
53297 ^ to eat.’
53298 ^ said therefore to them - jesus,
53303 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
53307 ^ not moses has given you the bread from - heaven,
53316 ^ but the father of me gives you the bread from - heaven
53327 ^ - true.
53329 ^ the for
53331 ^ bread - of god is
53335 ^ the [one] coming down out of - heaven
53340 ^ and life giving to the world.
53345 ^ they said therefore to him,
53349 ^ sir, always give to us the bread this.
53356 ^ said to them - jesus,
53360 ^ i am the bread - of life;
54150 ^ these things now having said to them, he remained in - galilee.
54158 ^ when however had gone up the brothers of him to the feast,
54167 ^ then also he went up,
54171 ^ not openly,
54173 ^ but as in secret.
54177 ^ the therefore
54179 ^ jews were seeking him at the feast
54185 ^ and were saying,
54187 ^ where is he?
54190 ^ and murmuring about him there was much among the crowds.
54199 ^ some indeed were saying
54202 ^ -, good he is.
54205 ^ others however were saying,
54208 ^ no,
54209 ^ but he deceives the people.
54213 ^ no one however publicly was speaking about him, because of the fear of the jews.
54224 ^ now also of the feast being in the middle,
54229 ^ went up jesus into the temple
54234 ^ and was teaching.
54236 ^ were marveling then the jews,
54240 ^ saying,
54241 ^ how this one writings knows,
54245 ^ not having studied?
54247 ^ answered therefore them - jesus
54252 ^ and said
54254 ^ -, my teaching not is of myself,
54260 ^ but
54261 ^ of the [one] having sent me.
54264 ^ if anyone desires
54267 ^ the will of him to do,
54271 ^ he will know concerning the teaching,
54275 ^ whether from - god it is,
54280 ^ or i from myself speak.
55000 ^ having lifted up then, - jesus said to her,
55006 ^ woman, where are they?
55009 ^ no one you has condemned?
55012 ^ - and she said,
55015 ^ no one, sir.
55017 ^ said then - jesus,
55021 ^ neither i you do condemn;
55025 ^ go,
55026 ^ and from - now [on] no more sin.
55032 ^ again therefore to them spoke - jesus,
55038 ^ saying,
55039 ^ i am the light of the world;
56008 ^ these things having said, he spat on [the] ground,
56012 ^ and made clay of the spittle,
56018 ^ and applied to him the clay
56023 ^ to the eyes.
56026 ^ and he said to him,
56029 ^ go,
56030 ^ wash in the pool - of siloam,
56036 ^ which means
56038 ^ sent.
56039 ^ he went therefore
56041 ^ and washed,
56043 ^ and came [back]
56045 ^ seeing.
56046 ^ the therefore
56048 ^ neighbors
56049 ^ and those having seen him - before,
56055 ^ that a beggar he was, were saying,
56059 ^ not this is
56062 ^ he who was sitting
56064 ^ and begging?
56066 ^ some were saying
56068 ^ -, he it is,
56071 ^ but others were saying,
56073 ^ no,
56074 ^ but like him he is. he
56079 ^ kept saying
56080 ^ -, i am [he].
56083 ^ they were saying therefore to him,
56086 ^ how then were opened of you the eyes?
56092 ^ answered
56093 ^ he, the man
56096 ^ - called jesus clay made,
56101 ^ and anointed of me the eyes,
56106 ^ and he said to me
56109 ^ -, go to - siloam
56114 ^ and wash.
56116 ^ having gone therefore
56118 ^ and having washed, i received sight.
56121 ^ and they said to him,
56124 ^ where is he?
56127 ^ he says,
56128 ^ not i know.
56130 ^ they bring him to the pharisees
56135 ^ who once [was] blind.
56138 ^ was now sabbath
56141 ^ in which day the clay had made - jesus
56149 ^ and opened of him the eyes.
56154 ^ again therefore were asking him also the pharisees
56161 ^ how he had received sight.
56163 ^ - and he said to them,
56167 ^ clay he put of me on the eyes,
56173 ^ and i washed,
56175 ^ and i see.
56177 ^ were saying therefore of the pharisees some,
56183 ^ not is this from god
56188 ^ the man,
56190 ^ for the sabbath not he does keep.
56195 ^ others however were saying,
56198 ^ how is able a man sinful
56202 ^ such signs to do?
56205 ^ and division there was among them.
56210 ^ they say therefore to the blind [man] again,
56215 ^ what you say concerning him,
56220 ^ for he opened of you the eyes?
56225 ^ - and he said
56228 ^ -, a prophet he is.
56231 ^ not did believe then the jews concerning him
56238 ^ that he had been blind
56241 ^ and had received sight,
56243 ^ until when they called the parents of him
56249 ^ - having received sight.
56251 ^ and they asked them
56254 ^ saying,
56255 ^ this is the son of you,
56260 ^ of whom you say
56263 ^ that blind he was born?
56266 ^ how then does he see presently?
56270 ^ answered therefore the parents of him
56275 ^ and said,
56277 ^ we know
56278 ^ that this is the son of us,
56284 ^ and that blind he was born.
56288 ^ how however presently he sees,
56292 ^ not we know,
56294 ^ or who opened of him the eyes,
56300 ^ we not know;
56303 ^ him ask;
56305 ^ age has he.
56308 ^ concerning himself, he will speak.
56311 ^ these things said the parents of him
56316 ^ because they were afraid of the jews;
56320 ^ already for had agreed together the jews
56325 ^ that if anyone him should confess christ,
56331 ^ expelled from the synagogue he would be.
56333 ^ because of this, the parents of him said
56339 ^ -, age he has;
56342 ^ him ask.
56344 ^ they called therefore the man out a second time
57375 ^ having heard then, - jesus said,
57380 ^ this - sickness not is unto death,
57387 ^ but for the glory - of god,
57393 ^ that may be glorified the son - of god by it.
57401 ^ loved now - jesus - martha, and the sister of her, and - lazarus.
57414 ^ when therefore he heard
57417 ^ that he is sick,
57419 ^ then indeed he remained
57422 ^ in which he was
57425 ^ [the] place two days.
57428 ^ then after this he says to the disciples,
57434 ^ let us go into - judea again.
57439 ^ say to him the disciples,
57443 ^ rabbi, just now were seeking
57446 ^ you to stone the jews,
57450 ^ and again you are going there?
57454 ^ answered jesus,
57456 ^ not twelve hours are there in the day?
57462 ^ if anyone walks in the day,
57468 ^ not he stumbles,
57470 ^ because the light the world of this he sees;
57477 ^ if however anyone walks in the night,
57484 ^ he stumbles,
57485 ^ because the light not is in him.
57492 ^ these things he said,
57494 ^ and after this he says to them,
57499 ^ lazarus the friend of us has fallen asleep,
57504 ^ but i go
57506 ^ that i may awaken him.
57509 ^ said therefore the disciples of him,
57514 ^ lord, if he has fallen asleep,
57517 ^ he will get well.
57518 ^ had spoken however - jesus of the death of him;
57526 ^ they however thought
57529 ^ that of the rest - of sleep he speaks.
57536 ^ then therefore said to them - jesus plainly,
57543 ^ lazarus has died.
57545 ^ and i rejoice for sake of you,
57549 ^ in order that you might believe,
57551 ^ that not i was there.
57555 ^ but let us go to him.
57559 ^ said therefore thomas,
57562 ^ - called didymus, to the fellow disciples,
57567 ^ let go also us,
57570 ^ that we may die with him.
57574 ^ having come therefore, - jesus found him,
57580 ^ four already
57582 ^ days having been in the tomb.
57587 ^ was now - bethany near - jerusalem, about away stadia fifteen.
57598 ^ many now
57600 ^ of the jews had come unto - martha and mary
57609 ^ that they might console them concerning the brother.
57615 ^ - therefore
57617 ^ martha,
57618 ^ when she heard
57620 ^ that jesus is coming,
57623 ^ met him;
57625 ^ mary however in the house was sitting.
57631 ^ said then - martha to - jesus,
57638 ^ lord, if you had been here,
57642 ^ not - would have died the brother of me.
57648 ^ nevertheless even now i know
57652 ^ that
57653 ^ whatever - you might ask - god, will give you - god.
57662 ^ says to her - jesus,
57666 ^ will rise again the brother of you.
57670 ^ says to him - martha,
57674 ^ i know
57675 ^ that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day.
57684 ^ said to her - jesus,
57688 ^ i am the resurrection and the life;
57825 ^ having seen him, fell of him at the feet,
57832 ^ saying to him,
57834 ^ lord, if you had been here,
57838 ^ not - of me would have died
57842 ^ the brother.
57844 ^ jesus therefore
57846 ^ when he saw her
57849 ^ weeping, and the
57852 ^ having come with her jews
57855 ^ weeping,
57856 ^ he was deeply moved - in spirit
57859 ^ and troubled himself.
57862 ^ and he said,
57864 ^ where have you laid him.
57867 ^ they say to him,
57869 ^ lord, come
57871 ^ and see.
57873 ^ wept - jesus.
57876 ^ were saying therefore the jews,
57880 ^ behold
57881 ^ how he loved him!
57884 ^ some however
57886 ^ of them said,
57889 ^ not was able this [man]
57892 ^ - having opened the eyes of the blind,
57898 ^ to have caused
57899 ^ that also this one not should have died?
57904 ^ jesus therefore
57906 ^ again, being deeply moved in himself, comes to the tomb.
57914 ^ it was now a cave,
57917 ^ and a stone was lying against it.
57922 ^ says - jesus,
57925 ^ take away the stone.
57928 ^ says to him the sister
57932 ^ of the [one] having died, martha,
57935 ^ lord, already he stinks,
57938 ^ four days for it is.
57941 ^ says to her - jesus,
57945 ^ not said i to you
57948 ^ that if you should believe,
57951 ^ you will see the glory - of god?
57956 ^ they took away therefore the stone.
57960 ^ - now
57962 ^ jesus lifted his eyes upwards
57967 ^ and said,
57969 ^ father, i thank you
57972 ^ that you have heard me.
57975 ^ i and knew
57978 ^ that always me you hear;
57982 ^ but on account of the crowd
57986 ^ - standing around i said [it],
57989 ^ that they may believe
57991 ^ that you me sent.
57995 ^ and
57996 ^ these things having said, in a voice loud he cried out,
58001 ^ lazarus, come forth.
58004 ^ came forth
58005 ^ the [one] having been dead,
58007 ^ being bound the feet and the hands with linen strips,
58014 ^ and the face of him in a headcloth bound about.
58020 ^ says to them - jesus,
58024 ^ unbind him
58026 ^ and allow him
58029 ^ to go.
58030 ^ many therefore
58032 ^ of the jews
58035 ^ - having come to - mary
58040 ^ and having seen
58042 ^ what he did, believed in him;
58047 ^ some however
58049 ^ of them went to the pharisees
58055 ^ and told them
58058 ^ what had done jesus.
58061 ^ gathered therefore the chief priests and the pharisees a council,
58069 ^ and they were saying,
58071 ^ what are we to do?
58073 ^ for this - man many does
58079 ^ signs.
58080 ^ if we shall let him alone him like this,
58084 ^ all will believe in him,
58088 ^ and will come the romans
58092 ^ and will take away of us both the place and the nation.
58101 ^ one however
58103 ^ certain of them, caiaphas,
58107 ^ high priest being
58109 ^ the year same, said to them,
58114 ^ you not know nothing,
58118 ^ nor consider you
58120 ^ that it is profitable for you
58123 ^ that one man should die for the people,
58130 ^ and not all the nation should perish.
58136 ^ this now from himself not he said,
58142 ^ but
58143 ^ high priest being
58145 ^ the year that, he prophesied
58149 ^ that was about jesus
58152 ^ to die for the nation,
58156 ^ and not for the nation only,
58162 ^ but that also the children - of god,
58169 ^ those having been scattered, he might gather together into one.
58174 ^ from that therefore
58177 ^ - day they took counsel together
58180 ^ that they might kill him.
58183 ^ - therefore
58185 ^ jesus no longer publicly walked among the jews,
58192 ^ but went away from there into the region near the wilderness, to
58202 ^ ephraim called a city.
58205 ^ and there he stayed with the disciples.
58210 ^ was now near the passover of the jews,
58217 ^ and went up many to jerusalem out of the region before the passover,
58228 ^ so that they might purify themselves.
58231 ^ they were seeking therefore - jesus
58235 ^ and were saying among one another
58239 ^ in the temple standing,
58243 ^ what does it seem to you,
58246 ^ that no not he will come to the feast?
58253 ^ had given now the chief priests and the pharisees a command
58261 ^ that if anyone should know
58265 ^ where he is,
58267 ^ he should show [it],
58268 ^ so that they might seize him.
58271 ^ - therefore
58273 ^ jesus, before six days the passover, came to bethany,
58282 ^ where was lazarus,
58285 ^ whom had raised out from [the] dead jesus.
58290 ^ they made therefore him a supper there,
58295 ^ and - martha was serving,
58299 ^ - and
58301 ^ lazarus one was
58504 ^ having found then - jesus a young donkey, he sat upon it,
58512 ^ as it is
58514 ^ written:
58515 ^ not fear, daughter of zion.
58519 ^ behold,
58520 ^ the king of you comes,
58524 ^ sitting on a colt of a donkey.”
58528 ^ these things not knew of him the disciples from the first,
58536 ^ but when was glorified jesus,
58540 ^ then they remembered
58542 ^ that these things were
58545 ^ of him written,
58548 ^ and these things they had done to him.
58552 ^ continued to bear witness therefore the crowd
58556 ^ - being with him
58560 ^ when - lazarus he called out of the tomb
58567 ^ and raised him out from [the] dead.
58572 ^ on account of this also met him the crowd,
58579 ^ because they heard
58581 ^ this of his having done
58584 ^ the sign.
58586 ^ - therefore
58588 ^ the pharisees said among themselves,
58592 ^ you see
58593 ^ that not you gain nothing.
58597 ^ behold,
58598 ^ the world after him has gone.
58603 ^ there were now greeks certain
58607 ^ among those coming up
58610 ^ that they might worship at the feast;
58615 ^ these therefore came to philip, who was from bethsaida - of galilee,
58624 ^ and they were asking him
58627 ^ saying,
58628 ^ sir, we desire
58630 ^ - jesus to see.
58633 ^ comes - philip
58636 ^ and tells - andrew;
58640 ^ come andrew and philip
58644 ^ and tell - jesus.
58648 ^ - and
58650 ^ jesus answered them
58653 ^ saying,
58654 ^ has come the hour
58657 ^ that should be glorified the son - of man.
58663 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
58667 ^ if not the grain - of wheat,
58673 ^ having fallen into the ground, should die,
58678 ^ it alone abides;
58681 ^ if however it should die,
58684 ^ much fruit it bears.
59521 ^ these things having said, - jesus was troubled - in spirit,
59528 ^ and he testified
59530 ^ and said,
59532 ^ truly, truly, i say to you
59536 ^ that one of you will betray me.
59542 ^ began to look upon one another the disciples,
59547 ^ being uncertain
59548 ^ of whom he is speaking.
59551 ^ there was
59552 ^ reclining one of the disciples of him in the bosom - of jesus,
59563 ^ whom loved - jesus.
59567 ^ motions therefore to him simon peter
59572 ^ to ask
59573 ^ who it is
59576 ^ about whom he is speaking?
59579 ^ having leaned then he thus on the breast - of jesus, he says to him,
59590 ^ lord, who is it?
59593 ^ answers - jesus,
59596 ^ he it is
59598 ^ to whom i will dip the morsel
59603 ^ and will give him.
59606 ^ having dipped then the morsel, he takes [it]
59611 ^ and gives [it] to judas, [son] of simon iscariot.
59616 ^ and after the morsel, then entered into him - satan.
59626 ^ says therefore to him - jesus,
59671 ^ having received therefore the morsel, he went out immediately;
59678 ^ it was now night.
59681 ^ when therefore he had gone out,
59684 ^ says jesus,
59686 ^ now has been glorified the son - of man,
59692 ^ and - god has been glorified in him.
59698 ^ if - god is glorified in him,
59704 ^ also - god will glorify him in himself,
59711 ^ and immediately will glorify him.
59715 ^ little children, yet a little while with you i am.
59721 ^ you will seek me;
59723 ^ and, as i said to the jews
59728 ^ -: where i go,
59732 ^ you not are able
59735 ^ to come,
59736 ^ also to you i say now.
59740 ^ a commandment new i give to you,
59744 ^ that you should love one another;
59747 ^ as i have loved you,
59750 ^ so also you should love one another.
59755 ^ by this will know all
59759 ^ that to me disciples you are,
59763 ^ if love you have among one another.
59768 ^ says to him simon peter,
59772 ^ lord, where go you?
59775 ^ answered him jesus,
59778 ^ where i go,
59780 ^ not you are able
59782 ^ me now to follow;
59785 ^ you will follow however afterward.
59788 ^ says to him - peter,
59792 ^ lord, because of why not am i able
59797 ^ you to follow presently?
59800 ^ the life of me for you i will lay down.
59806 ^ answered jesus,
59808 ^ the life of you for me will you lay down?
59814 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
59818 ^ no not [the] rooster will crow,
59822 ^ until that you will deny me three times.
59827 ^ not let be troubled of you the heart.
59832 ^ you believe in - god,
59836 ^ also in me believe.
59840 ^ in the house of the father of me, mansions many there are;
59849 ^ if now not,
59852 ^ would i have told - you
59855 ^ that i go
59857 ^ to prepare a place for you?
59860 ^ and if i go
59863 ^ and prepare a place for you,
59867 ^ again i am coming
59869 ^ and will receive you to myself,
59874 ^ that where am i,
59878 ^ also you may be.
59881 ^ and to the place i am going,
59885 ^ you know the way.”
59888 ^ says to him thomas,
59891 ^ lord, not we know
59894 ^ where you are going;
59896 ^ how can we
59898 ^ the way know?
59901 ^ says to him - jesus,
59905 ^ i am the way, and the truth, and the life.
59915 ^ no one comes to the father,
59920 ^ if not by me.
59924 ^ if you had known me,
59927 ^ also the father of me you would have known;
59932 ^ from now you know him
59936 ^ and have seen him.
59939 ^ says to him philip,
59942 ^ lord, show us the father,
59947 ^ and it is enough for us.
59950 ^ says to him - jesus,
59954 ^ so long a time with you am i,
59959 ^ and not you have known me,
59963 ^ philip?
59964 ^ the [one] having seen me has seen the father;
59970 ^ how you say,
59973 ^ show us the father?’
59977 ^ not believe you
59979 ^ that i [am] in the father,
59984 ^ and the father in me is?
59990 ^ the words
59992 ^ that i speak to you, from myself not i speak,
60000 ^ - but
60002 ^ the father
60003 ^ in me dwelling does the works of him.
60010 ^ believe me
60012 ^ that i [am] in the father,
60017 ^ and the father in me;
60022 ^ if but not,
60025 ^ because of the works themselves believe.
60030 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
61982 ^ these things having said, jesus went out with the disciples of him beyond the winter stream - of kidron,
61995 ^ where there was a garden,
61998 ^ into which entered he and the disciples of him.
62006 ^ knew now also judas,
62010 ^ who was delivering up him, the place,
62015 ^ because often gathered together jesus there with the disciples of him.
62024 ^ - therefore
62026 ^ judas,
62027 ^ having procured the cohort and from the chief priests and from the pharisees officers, comes there with lanterns, and torches, and weapons.
62047 ^ jesus therefore,
62049 ^ knowing
62050 ^ all things that are coming upon him, having gone forth
62056 ^ also said to them,
62059 ^ whom seek you?
62061 ^ they answered him,
62063 ^ jesus of nazareth.
62066 ^ he says to them,
62068 ^ i am [he].
62070 ^ had been standing now also judas,
62074 ^ who is delivering up him, with them.
62079 ^ when therefore he said to them,
62083 ^ i am [he],
62085 ^ they drew toward the back
62089 ^ and fell to [the] ground.
62092 ^ again therefore he questioned them,
62096 ^ whom seek you?
62098 ^ - and they said,
62101 ^ jesus of nazareth.
62104 ^ answered jesus,
62106 ^ i have told you
62108 ^ that i am [he].
62111 ^ if therefore me you seek,
62115 ^ allow these
62117 ^ to go away,
62118 ^ so that might be fulfilled the word
62122 ^ that he had spoken
62124 ^ -,
62125 ^ those whom you have given me, not i lost
62130 ^ of them not one.
62133 ^ simon then
62135 ^ peter,
62136 ^ having a sword, drew it
62140 ^ and struck the of the high priest servant,
62146 ^ and cut off of him the ear - right.
62153 ^ was now name of the servant malchus.
62159 ^ said therefore - jesus - to peter,
62165 ^ put the sword into the sheath.
62171 ^ the cup
62173 ^ which has given me the father,
62178 ^ no not shall i drink it?
62182 ^ - then
62184 ^ the cohort and the commander and the officers of the jews took hold of - jesus
62196 ^ and bound him,
62199 ^ and they led [him] away to annas first;
62204 ^ he was for father-in-law - of caiaphas,
62209 ^ who was high priest the year same.
62215 ^ was now caiaphas
62218 ^ the [one] having given counsel to the jews
62222 ^ that it is profitable
62224 ^ for one man to perish for the people.
62230 ^ were following now - jesus simon peter and the other disciple.
62239 ^ since now
62241 ^ disciple that was known to the high priest,
62247 ^ also he entered with - jesus into the court of the high priest.
62256 ^ - but
62258 ^ peter stood at the door outside.
62264 ^ went out therefore the disciple - other, who was known to the high priest,
62274 ^ and spoke to the doorkeeper,
62278 ^ and brought in - peter.
62282 ^ says therefore - to peter the servant girl, the doorkeeper,
62290 ^ not also you of the disciples are
62297 ^ of the man this?
62300 ^ says he,
62302 ^ not i am.
62304 ^ were standing now the servants and the officers,
62311 ^ a fire of coals having made,
62313 ^ for cold it was
62316 ^ and they were warming themselves.
62318 ^ was now also - peter
62323 ^ with them standing
62326 ^ and warming himself.
62328 ^ - then
62330 ^ the high priest questioned - jesus concerning the disciples of him and concerning the teaching of him.
62343 ^ answered him jesus,
62346 ^ i openly have spoken to the world;
62351 ^ i always taught in [the] synagogue and in the temple,
62360 ^ where all the jews come together,
62365 ^ and in secret i spoke nothing.
62370 ^ why me do you question?
62373 ^ question
62374 ^ those having heard
62376 ^ what i spoke to them;
62379 ^ behold,
62380 ^ they know
62382 ^ what said i.
62385 ^ these things now of him having said,
62389 ^ one
62390 ^ standing by of the officers gave a blow with the palm - to jesus,
62397 ^ having said,
62398 ^ thus answer you the high priest?
62402 ^ answered him jesus,
62405 ^ if evil i spoke,
62408 ^ bear witness concerning the evil;
62412 ^ if however rightly,
62415 ^ why me strike you?
62418 ^ sent then him - annas,
63331 ^ a sponge therefore filled with sour wine, a stalk of hyssop having put on, they brought it to the mouth.
63342 ^ when therefore took the sour wine
63347 ^ - jesus, he said,
63350 ^ it has been finished.
63351 ^ and
63352 ^ having bowed the head, he yielded up the spirit.
63358 ^ - therefore
63360 ^ the jews,
63361 ^ because [the] preparation it was,
63364 ^ so that not would remain on the cross the bodies on the sabbath —
63375 ^ was for a high - day that - sabbath —
63383 ^ asked - pilate
63386 ^ that might be broken their - legs,
63391 ^ and they might be taken away.
63393 ^ came therefore the soldiers,
63397 ^ and of the indeed
63400 ^ first broke
63402 ^ the legs, and of the other
63407 ^ - having been crucified with him;
63410 ^ to however - jesus having come,
63415 ^ when they saw already him having been dead, not they did break his - legs.
63425 ^ but one of the soldiers with a spear his - side pierced,
63434 ^ and came out immediately blood and water.
63440 ^ and
63441 ^ the [one] having seen has borne witness,
63444 ^ and true of him is
63448 ^ the testimony.
63450 ^ and he knows
63453 ^ that truth he is speaking,
63456 ^ that also you might believe.
63460 ^ took place for these things
63463 ^ so that the scripture might be fulfilled:
63467 ^ bone not one will be broken
63470 ^ of him.”
63471 ^ and again, another scripture says:
63476 ^ they will look
63477 ^ on the [one] they have pierced.”
63480 ^ after then
63482 ^ these things, asked - pilate joseph - from arimathea,
63490 ^ being a disciple - of jesus —
63816 ^ these things having said, she turned back - around,
63822 ^ and she sees - jesus
63826 ^ standing [there],
63827 ^ and not had known
63830 ^ that jesus it is.
63833 ^ says to her jesus,
63836 ^ woman, why do you weep?
63839 ^ whom do you seek?
63841 ^ she,
63842 ^ thinking
63843 ^ that the gardener he is, says to him,
63849 ^ sir, if you have carried off him,
63854 ^ tell me
63856 ^ where you have laid him,
63859 ^ and i him will take away.
63862 ^ says to her jesus,
63865 ^ mary.
63866 ^ having turned around, she says to him in hebrew,
63871 ^ rabboni,
63872 ^ that is to say, teacher.
63875 ^ says to her jesus,
63878 ^ not me touch,
63881 ^ not yet for have i ascended to the father;
63887 ^ go however to the brothers of me
63893 ^ and say to them,
63896 ^ i am ascending to the father of me and father of you, and [to] god of me and god of you.
63910 ^ comes mary - magdalene
63914 ^ bringing word to the disciples
63917 ^ -, i have seen the lord,
63921 ^ and [that] these things he had said to her.
63925 ^ it being therefore evening the day same, the first of [the] week,
63934 ^ and the doors having been shut,
63938 ^ where were the disciples through the fear of the jews,
63947 ^ came - jesus
63950 ^ and stood in the midst,
63955 ^ and he says to them,
63958 ^ peace to you.
63960 ^ and
63961 ^ this having said, he showed his hands and his side to them.
63970 ^ rejoiced then the disciples,
63974 ^ having seen the lord.
63977 ^ said therefore to them - jesus again,
63983 ^ peace to you;
63985 ^ as has sent forth me the father,
63990 ^ i also send you.
63993 ^ and
63994 ^ this having said, he breathed on [them],
63997 ^ and he says to them,
64000 ^ receive [the] spirit holy.
64003 ^ if of any, you might forgive
64006 ^ the sins,
64008 ^ they are forgiven them;
64010 ^ if any you might retain,
64013 ^ they are retained.
64014 ^ thomas however,
64016 ^ one of the twelve,
64020 ^ the [one] called didymus, not was with them
64027 ^ when came jesus.
64030 ^ were saying therefore to him the other disciples,
64036 ^ we have seen the lord.
64039 ^ - but he said to them,
64043 ^ if not i see in the hands of him the mark of the nails,
64054 ^ and put the finger of me into the mark of the nails,
64064 ^ and put of me the hand into the side of him,
64073 ^ no not will i believe.
64076 ^ and after days eight again were inside the disciples of him,
64086 ^ and thomas with them.
64090 ^ comes - jesus,
64093 ^ the doors having been shut.
64096 ^ and he stood in the midst
64101 ^ and said,
64103 ^ peace to you.
64105 ^ then he says - to thomas,
64109 ^ bring the finger of you here,
64114 ^ and see the hands of me;
64119 ^ and bring the hand of you,
64124 ^ and put [it] into the side of me;
64130 ^ and not be unbelieving,
64134 ^ but believing.
64136 ^ answered thomas
64138 ^ and said to him,
64141 ^ the lord of me and the god of me!
64148 ^ says to him - jesus,
64152 ^ because you have seen me,
64155 ^ you have believed;
64156 ^ blessed [are]
64157 ^ those not
64159 ^ having seen,
64160 ^ yet having believed.
64162 ^ many indeed therefore also
64166 ^ other signs did - jesus in the presence of the disciples of him,
64175 ^ which not are
64178 ^ written in the book this;
64183 ^ these however have been written
64186 ^ that you may believe
64188 ^ that jesus is the christ, the son - of god,
64197 ^ and that
64199 ^ believing, life you may have in the name of him.
64206 ^ after these things, revealed himself again - jesus to the disciples at the sea - of tiberias.
64220 ^ he revealed [himself] now in this way:
64223 ^ they were together, simon peter, and thomas
64229 ^ - called didymus, and nathanael - from cana - of galilee, and the [sons] - of zebedee, and others of the disciples his two.
64250 ^ says to them simon peter,
64254 ^ i am going
64255 ^ to fish.
64256 ^ they say to him,
64258 ^ come also we with you.
64263 ^ they went forth
64264 ^ and went up into the boat,
64269 ^ and during that - night they caught nothing.
64276 ^ morning now already having come,
64280 ^ stood jesus on the shore;
64285 ^ not however knew the disciples
64290 ^ that jesus it is.
64293 ^ says therefore to them - jesus,
64298 ^ children, not any fish have you?
64303 ^ they answered him,
64305 ^ no.
64306 ^ - and he said to them,
64310 ^ cast to the right side of the boat the net,
64319 ^ and you will find [some].
64321 ^ they cast therefore,
64323 ^ and not
64325 ^ it to haul in were they able, from the multitude of the fish.
64333 ^ says therefore the disciple that
64338 ^ whom loved - jesus - to peter,
64344 ^ the lord it is.
64347 ^ simon therefore
64349 ^ peter,
64350 ^ having heard
64351 ^ that the lord it is, the outer garment put on
64358 ^ he was for naked
64361 ^ and he cast himself into the sea.
64367 ^ - and
64369 ^ the other disciples in the boat came,
64374 ^ not for were they far from the land,
64381 ^ but about away cubits two hundred,
64386 ^ dragging the net with the fish.
64391 ^ when therefore they got out onto the land,
64397 ^ they see a fire of coals
64399 ^ lying, and fish
64402 ^ lying on [it], and bread.
64405 ^ says to them - jesus,
64409 ^ bring [some] of the fish
64413 ^ that you have caught now.
64416 ^ went up therefore simon peter
64420 ^ and drew the net to the land,
64427 ^ full of fish large, a hundred fifty three;
64433 ^ although so many there are,
64436 ^ not was torn the net.
64440 ^ says to them - jesus,
64444 ^ come,
64445 ^ have breakfast.
64446 ^ none however dared
64449 ^ of the disciples
64451 ^ to ask him,
64453 ^ you who are?
64456 ^ knowing
64457 ^ that the lord it is.
64461 ^ comes jesus
64463 ^ and takes the bread
64467 ^ and gives [it] to them,
64470 ^ and the fish likewise.
64474 ^ this [is] now
64476 ^ the third time was revealed jesus to the disciples,
64481 ^ having been raised out from [the] dead.
64484 ^ when therefore they had dined,
64487 ^ says - to simon peter - jesus,
64493 ^ simon [son] of john, love you me more than these?
64499 ^ he says to him,
64501 ^ yes, lord;
64503 ^ you know
64505 ^ that i dearly love you.
64508 ^ he says to him,
64510 ^ feed the lambs of me.
64514 ^ he says to him again a second time,
64518 ^ simon [son] of john, love you me?
64522 ^ he says to him,
64524 ^ yes, lord;
64526 ^ you know
64528 ^ that i dearly love you.
64531 ^ he says to him,
64533 ^ shepherd the sheep of me.
64537 ^ he says to him the third time,
64541 ^ simon [son] of john, do you dearly love me?
64545 ^ was grieved - peter
64548 ^ because he said to him the third time,
64553 ^ do you dearly love me?
64555 ^ and he said to him,
64558 ^ lord, all things you know;
64562 ^ you know
64564 ^ that i dearly love you.
64567 ^ says to him - jesus,
64571 ^ feed the sheep of me.
64575 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
64579 ^ when you were younger,
64582 ^ you dressed yourself
64584 ^ and walked
64586 ^ where you desired;
64588 ^ when however you shall be old,
64591 ^ you will stretch forth the hands of you,
64595 ^ and another you will dress
64599 ^ and will bring [you]
64601 ^ where not you do desire.
64604 ^ this now he said
64607 ^ signifying
64608 ^ by what death he will glorify - god.
64613 ^ and
64614 ^ this having said, he says to him,
64618 ^ follow me.
64620 ^ having turned, - peter sees the disciple
64626 ^ whom loved - jesus
64630 ^ following,
64631 ^ who also had reclined at the supper on the bosom of him,
64641 ^ and said,
64643 ^ lord, who is it
64646 ^ who is betraying you?
64649 ^ him therefore having seen, - peter says - to jesus,
64657 ^ lord, this man and what about?
64661 ^ says to him - jesus,
64665 ^ if
64666 ^ him i desire
64668 ^ to remain
64669 ^ until i come,
64671 ^ what [is it] to you?
64674 ^ you me follow!
64677 ^ went out therefore this - saying among the brothers,
64685 ^ that the disciple that, not dies.
64691 ^ not said however to him - jesus
64697 ^ that not he dies,
64700 ^ but, if
64702 ^ him i desire
64704 ^ to remain
64705 ^ until i come,
64707 ^ what [is it] to you?
64710 ^ this is the disciple
64714 ^ - bearing witness concerning these things,
64718 ^ and the [one] having written these things,
64722 ^ and we know
64724 ^ that true of him the testimony is.
64730 ^ there are now also other things many
64735 ^ that did - jesus,
64739 ^ which if they should be written every one,
64744 ^ not even
64745 ^ itself i suppose the world to have space for the
64751 ^ to be written books.
64753 ^ the indeed
64755 ^ first account i composed concerning all the things, o theophilus,
65452 ^ having stood up however - peter with the eleven, he lifted up the voice of him
65463 ^ and spoke forth to them:
65466 ^ men of judea
65468 ^ and those inhabiting jerusalem
65472 ^ all, this to you known let be,
65477 ^ and give heed to the words of me.
65482 ^ not for
65484 ^ as you suppose, these are drunkards;
65489 ^ it is for [the] hour third of the day;
65495 ^ but this is
65498 ^ that having been spoken by the prophet joel:
65504 ^ and it will be in the last days,
65510 ^ says - god,
65513 ^ i will pour out of the spirit of me upon all flesh;
65521 ^ and will prophesy the sons of you, and the daughters of you;
65530 ^ and the young men of you visions will see,
65536 ^ and the elders of you dreams will dream;
65542 ^ and even upon the servants of me, and upon the handmaidens of me, in the days those i will pour out of the spirit of me,
65562 ^ and they will prophesy.
65564 ^ and i will show wonders in - heaven above,
65571 ^ and signs on the earth below,
65577 ^ blood and fire and vapor of smoke.
65583 ^ the sun will be turned into darkness,
65588 ^ and the moon into blood,
65593 ^ before coming day of [the] lord, - great and glorious.
65601 ^ and it shall be,
65603 ^ everyone
65604 ^ who if they shall call upon the name of [the] lord will be saved.’
65611 ^ men, israelites, hear the words these:
65617 ^ jesus of nazareth, a man
65621 ^ having been set forth by - god to you by miracles and wonders and signs,
65632 ^ which did by him - god in the midst of you,
65641 ^ as you yourselves know,
65644 ^ him by the
65646 ^ determinate plan and foreknowledge - of god, delivered up by hands lawless,
65656 ^ having crucified, you put to death,
65658 ^ whom - god raised up,
65662 ^ having loosed the agony of death,
65667 ^ inasmuch as not it was possible
65671 ^ [for] to be held him by it.
65675 ^ david for says about him:
65680 ^ i foresaw the lord before me continually everything,
65687 ^ because at [the] right hand of me he is,
65692 ^ that not i should be shaken.
65695 ^ because of this was glad the heart, of me
65701 ^ and rejoiced the tongue of me;
65706 ^ and now also the flesh of me will dwell in hope,
65715 ^ for not you will abandon the soul of me into hades,
65723 ^ nor will you allow the holy one of you
65728 ^ to see decay.
65730 ^ you have made known to me [the] paths of life;
65734 ^ you will fill me with joy in the presence of you.’
65741 ^ men, brothers,
65743 ^ it is permitted [me]
65744 ^ to speak with freedom to you concerning the patriarch david,
65753 ^ that both he died
65756 ^ and was buried,
65758 ^ and the tomb of him is among us unto the day this.
65769 ^ a prophet therefore
65771 ^ being,
65772 ^ and knowing
65774 ^ that with an oath swore to him - god
65780 ^ out of [the] fruit of the loins of him to set upon the throne of him.
65790 ^ having foreseen, he spoke concerning the resurrection of the christ,
65797 ^ that neither was he abandoned into hades,
65802 ^ nor the flesh of him saw decay.
65808 ^ this - jesus has raised up - god,
65814 ^ whereof all we are
65818 ^ witnesses.
65819 ^ to the right hand therefore
65822 ^ - of god having been exalted,
65825 ^ - and
65827 ^ the promise of the spirit - holy having received from the father, he has poured out this
65838 ^ which you both are seeing
65842 ^ and hearing.
65844 ^ not for david ascended into the heavens;
65851 ^ he says however himself:
65854 ^ said the lord to [the] lord of me,
65860 ^ sit at [the] right hand of me,
65864 ^ until - i place the enemies of you, a footstool of the feet of you.’
65874 ^ assuredly therefore let know all [the] house of israel
65880 ^ that both lord him
65884 ^ and christ has made - god —
65889 ^ this - jesus
65892 ^ whom you crucified.
65895 ^ having heard then, they were pierced to the heart;
65900 ^ they said then to - peter and the other apostles,
65909 ^ what shall we do, men, brothers?
65913 ^ peter then to them,
65917 ^ repent, he declared,
65919 ^ and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of the sins of you,
65933 ^ and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit.
65940 ^ to you for is the promise,
65945 ^ and to the children of you, and to all those at a distance,
65954 ^ as many as - shall call to himself [the] lord, the god of us.
65961 ^ other and
65963 ^ words many he earnestly testified,
65966 ^ and was exhorting them,
65969 ^ saying,
65970 ^ be saved from the generation - perverse this.
65977 ^ those indeed therefore
65980 ^ having received the word of him were baptized;
65985 ^ and were added on the day that, souls about three thousand.
65994 ^ they were now
65996 ^ steadfastly continuing in the teaching of the apostles, and - in fellowship, the breaking of the bread, and the prayers.
66011 ^ there was coming then upon every soul awe,
66153 ^ having looked intently now peter upon him, with - john, he said,
66162 ^ look unto us.
66165 ^ - and he began to give heed to them,
66169 ^ expecting
66170 ^ something from them to receive.
66174 ^ said however peter,
66177 ^ silver and gold none there is to me;
66183 ^ what however i have,
66186 ^ this to you i give:
66189 ^ in the name of jesus christ of nazareth, rise up
66197 ^ and walk!”
66199 ^ and
66200 ^ having taken him by the right hand, he raised up him;
66207 ^ immediately then were strengthened the feet of him, and the ankles.
66216 ^ and
66217 ^ leaping up, he stood
66219 ^ and began walking,
66221 ^ and he entered with them into the temple,
66228 ^ walking
66229 ^ and leaping
66231 ^ and praising - god.
66235 ^ and saw all the people him
66241 ^ walking
66242 ^ and praising - god.
66246 ^ they recognized then him,
66249 ^ that he was
66252 ^ the [one] for the alms
66256 ^ sitting at the beautiful gate of the temple;
66263 ^ and they were filled with wonder and amazement
66268 ^ at that having happened to him.
66272 ^ is clinging now he to peter and - john;
66280 ^ ran together all the people to them in the porch
66289 ^ - called solomon’s, greatly amazed.
66293 ^ having seen [it] however, - peter answered to the people:
66301 ^ men, israelites, why wonder you at this?
66307 ^ or on us why you look intently,
66311 ^ as if by [our] own power or godliness
66316 ^ [we] have made
66317 ^ - to walk him?
66320 ^ the god of abraham, and the god of isaac, and the god jacob, the god of the fathers of us, has glorified the servant of him, jesus,
66341 ^ whom you indeed betrayed
66345 ^ and disowned in [the] presence of pilate,
66350 ^ having adjudged that one
66352 ^ to release [him].
66353 ^ you however the holy and righteous one denied,
66360 ^ and requested
66362 ^ a man, a murderer, to be granted to you;
66366 ^ - and
66368 ^ the author - of life you killed,
66372 ^ whom - god has raised up out from [the] dead,
66378 ^ whereof we
66380 ^ witnesses are.
66382 ^ and on the faith in the name of him, this [man]
66390 ^ whom you see
66392 ^ and know has strengthened the name of him;
66398 ^ and the faith which [is] through him has given to him the complete soundness this before all of you.
66412 ^ and now, brothers, i know
66416 ^ that in ignorance you acted,
66420 ^ as also the rulers of you.
66425 ^ - but
66427 ^ god
66428 ^ what he foretold by [the] mouth of all the prophets,
66837 ^ - and the man beholding
66841 ^ with them standing
66844 ^ - having been healed, nothing they had
66848 ^ to contradict.
66849 ^ having commanded however them
66852 ^ outside the council to go, they began to confer with one another,
66859 ^ saying,
66860 ^ what shall we do to the men these?
66865 ^ that truly for a noteworthy sign has come to pass through them,
66985 ^ having been let go now, they came to the own
66991 ^ and reported
66993 ^ how much to them the chief priests and the elders had said.
67002 ^ - and
67004 ^ having heard, with one accord they lifted up [their] voice to - god
67011 ^ and said,
67013 ^ sovereign lord, you
67015 ^ - made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all that [is] in them,
67030 ^ - of the father of us by [the] spirit holy
67037 ^ through [the] mouth david servant of you
67041 ^ having spoken
67042 ^ -: why did rage [the] gentiles,
67045 ^ and peoples did devise vain things?
67049 ^ took [their] stand the kings of the earth,
67054 ^ and the rulers were gathered together - themselves against the lord and against the christ of him.’
67069 ^ were gathered together for in truth, in the city this, against the holy servant of you jesus
67083 ^ whom you anointed, herod both and pontius pilate, with [the] gentiles and peoples of israel,
67095 ^ to do
67096 ^ whatever the hand of you and the purpose of you had determined beforehand
67105 ^ to happen.
67106 ^ and - now, lord, look upon the threats of them,
67115 ^ and grant to the servants of you
67120 ^ with boldness all to speak the word of you,
67127 ^ in that the hand of you
67132 ^ stretch out you
67134 ^ for healing, and signs and wonders to take place, through the name of the holy servant of you, jesus.
67149 ^ and having prayed they,
67152 ^ was shaken the place
67155 ^ in which they were
67158 ^ assembled,
67159 ^ and they were filled with all the holy spirit
67165 ^ and were speaking the word - of god with boldness.
67173 ^ - and
67175 ^ the multitude
67176 ^ - having believed were [in] heart and soul one,
67183 ^ and not one
67186 ^ anything
67187 ^ of that which possessed he, claimed
67191 ^ his own to be,
67193 ^ but were to them all things in common.
67198 ^ and [with] power great, were giving - testimony the apostles
67206 ^ of the resurrection; of the lord jesus
67211 ^ grace then
67213 ^ abundant was upon all them.
67218 ^ not even for in need anyone there was among them;
67368 ^ hearing now - ananias the words these,
67375 ^ having fallen down, he breathed his last.
67377 ^ and came fear great
67381 ^ upon all those hearing.
67385 ^ having arisen then, the younger [men] covered him,
67391 ^ and
67392 ^ having carried [him] out, buried [him].
67394 ^ it came to pass now about hours three afterward,
67400 ^ also the wife of him,
67404 ^ not knowing
67406 ^ that having come to pass, came in.
67409 ^ replied then to her peter,
67414 ^ tell me
67416 ^ if for so much, the land you sold?
67421 ^ - and she said,
67424 ^ yes,
67425 ^ for so much.
67426 ^ - but
67428 ^ peter [said] to her,
67431 ^ why [is it]
67432 ^ that have agreed together you
67435 ^ to test the spirit of [the] lord?
67439 ^ behold,
67440 ^ the feet
67442 ^ of those having buried the husband of you [are] at the door,
67450 ^ and they will carry out you.
67453 ^ she fell down then immediately at the feet of him
67460 ^ and breathed her last.
67462 ^ having come in then, the young [men] found her dead;
67469 ^ and
67470 ^ having carried out, they buried [her] by the husband of her.
67476 ^ and came fear great upon all the church
67484 ^ and upon all those hearing these things.
67490 ^ by now
67492 ^ the hands of the apostles were happening signs and wonders many among the people.
67504 ^ and they were with one accord, all in the colonnade of solomon;
67512 ^ of the now
67514 ^ rest, no one dared
67517 ^ to join them,
67519 ^ but were magnifying them the people;
67524 ^ more now were added
67527 ^ believing in the lord,
67530 ^ multitudes of men both, and women,
67535 ^ so as even into the streets to bring out the sick,
67543 ^ and to put [them] on cots and mats,
67549 ^ that coming of peter,
67552 ^ at least the shadow might envelop some of them.
67558 ^ were coming together now also the multitude from the surrounding cities
67566 ^ jerusalem,
67567 ^ bringing [the] sick
67569 ^ and [those] being tormented by spirits unclean,
67574 ^ who were healed
67576 ^ all.
67577 ^ having risen up however the high priest and all those with him,
67586 ^ - being the sect of the sadducees, were filled with jealousy,
67593 ^ and they laid the hands on the apostles
67600 ^ and put them in [the] jail public.
67606 ^ an angel however
67608 ^ of [the] lord, during the night
67611 ^ having opened the doors of the prison, having brought out then them,
67619 ^ said,
67620 ^ go,
67621 ^ and
67622 ^ having stood, speak in the temple to the people all the words of the life this.
67635 ^ having heard now, they entered at the dawn into the temple
67644 ^ and were teaching.
67646 ^ having come now the high priest and those with him, they called together the council, even all the senate of the sons of israel,
67664 ^ and sent to the prison house
67669 ^ to bring them.
67671 ^ - and
67681 ^ having returned then they reported back,
67684 ^ saying
67685 ^ -, the prison house we found
67689 ^ shut, with all security, and the guards
67696 ^ standing before the doors;
67700 ^ having opened [them] however, inside no one we found.
67705 ^ when now they heard the words these,
67711 ^ - both
67713 ^ the captain of the temple and the chief priests were perplexed concerning them,
67722 ^ what - might be this.
67726 ^ having come then, a certain one reported to them
67731 ^ -, behold,
67733 ^ the men
67735 ^ whom you put in the prison are
67741 ^ in the temple, standing
67745 ^ and teaching the people!
67749 ^ then
67750 ^ having gone, the captain with the officers was bringing them,
67758 ^ not with force;
67761 ^ they were afraid of for the people
67765 ^ lest they might be stoned.
67767 ^ having brought then them, they set [them] in the council.
67774 ^ and asked them the high priest,
67779 ^ saying,
67780 ^ not by a charge we commanded you
67784 ^ not to teach in the name this?
67790 ^ and behold,
67792 ^ you have filled - jerusalem with the teaching of you,
67798 ^ and you intend
67800 ^ to bring upon us the blood of the man this.
67808 ^ answering however, peter and the apostles said,
67879 ^ having risen up however a certain [man] in the council, a pharisee named gamaliel, a teacher of the law honored by all the people, he commanded [them]
67894 ^ outside for a short while the men to put.
67899 ^ he said then to them,
67903 ^ men, israelites, take heed to yourselves with the men these,
68081 ^ having called near then the twelve the multitude of the disciples, they said,
68090 ^ not desirable it is [for]
68093 ^ us,
68094 ^ having neglected the word - of god, to attend tables.
68101 ^ select therefore, brothers, men out from yourselves
68107 ^ being well attested, seven full of [the] spirit and wisdom,
68113 ^ whom we will appoint over the task this.
68119 ^ we now in the prayer and the ministry of the word will steadfastly continue.
68129 ^ and was pleasing the statement before all the multitude;
68137 ^ and they chose stephen, a man full of faith and [of the] spirit holy, and philip, and prochorus, and nicanor, and timon, and parmenas, and nicolas a convert of antioch,
68160 ^ whom they set before the apostles;
68165 ^ and
68166 ^ having prayed, they laid on them the hands.
68171 ^ and the word - of god continued to increase,
68177 ^ and was multiplied the number of the disciples in jerusalem exceedingly;
68186 ^ a great then
68188 ^ multitude of the priests were becoming obedient to the faith.
68194 ^ stephen now,
68196 ^ full grace and power, was performing wonders and signs great among the people.
68208 ^ arose however certain of those from the synagogue
68215 ^ - called freedmen, including cyrenians and alexandrians and of those from cilicia and asia,
68228 ^ disputing with stephen.
68231 ^ and not they were able
68234 ^ to withstand the wisdom and the spirit
68240 ^ by whom he was speaking.
68242 ^ then they suborned men,
68245 ^ saying
68246 ^ -, we have heard him
68249 ^ speaking words blasphemous against moses and - god.
68257 ^ they stirred up then the people and the elders and the scribes,
68267 ^ and
68268 ^ having come upon [him], they seized him
68271 ^ and brought [him] to the council.
68276 ^ they set also witnesses false,
68280 ^ saying,
68281 ^ the man this, not does stop
68286 ^ speaking words against the place - holy this and the law;
68297 ^ we have heard for him
68300 ^ saying
68301 ^ that jesus of nazareth this will destroy the place this
68310 ^ and will change the customs
68314 ^ that delivered to us moses.
68318 ^ and
68319 ^ having looked intently on him,
68322 ^ all - sitting in the council saw the face of him as [the] face of an angel.
68335 ^ said then the high priest,
68339 ^ if these things so are?
68343 ^ - and he began to speak:
68346 ^ men, brothers, and fathers, listen!
68351 ^ the god - of glory appeared to the father of us abraham,
68360 ^ being in - mesopotamia,
68364 ^ before rather dwelling his in haran,
68370 ^ and he said to him,
68374 ^ go out from the country of you and from the kindred of you,
68384 ^ and come into the land
68389 ^ which - to you i will show.’
68393 ^ then
68394 ^ having gone out from [the] land of chaldeans, he dwelt in haran.
68401 ^ and from there,
68402 ^ after - died the father of him, he removed him into the land this,
68414 ^ in which you now dwell.
68419 ^ and not he did give to him an inheritance in it,
68426 ^ not even [the] length of a foot;
68429 ^ but he promised
68431 ^ to give to him for a possession it,
68436 ^ and to the descendants of him after him,
68442 ^ not there being to him a child.
68446 ^ spoke however thus - god
68451 ^ that will be the seed of him a sojourner in a land strange,
68460 ^ and they will enslave it,
68463 ^ and will mistreat [it] years four hundred.
68467 ^ and the nation
68470 ^ to which if they will be in bondage, will judge i,
68475 ^ - god said,
68478 ^ and after these things they will come forth
68482 ^ and will serve me in the place this.’
68489 ^ and he gave to him [the] covenant of circumcision;
68494 ^ and thus he begat - isaac
68499 ^ and circumcised him on the day - eighth;
68506 ^ and isaac - jacob,
68510 ^ and jacob the twelve patriarchs.
68515 ^ and the patriarchs,
68518 ^ having envied - joseph, sold [him] into egypt.
68524 ^ but was - god with him,
68530 ^ and rescued him out of all the tribulations of him,
68538 ^ and gave him favor and wisdom before pharaoh, king of egypt;
68548 ^ and he appointed him
68551 ^ ruler over egypt, and over all the house of him.
68560 ^ came then a famine upon all - of egypt and canaan,
68569 ^ and affliction great,
68572 ^ and not were finding sustenance the fathers of us.
68579 ^ having heard now jacob [there] is grain in egypt, he sent forth the fathers of us first;
68591 ^ and on the second time, was made known joseph to brothers of him,
68600 ^ and known became - to pharaoh the family - of joseph.
68609 ^ having sent then joseph, he called for jacob, the father of him, and all the kindred, in all souls seventy five.
68625 ^ and went down jacob into egypt
68630 ^ and died, he
68633 ^ and the fathers of us,
68637 ^ and they were carried over into shechem
68641 ^ and were placed in the tomb
68646 ^ which had bought abraham for a sum of silver from the sons of hamor in shechem.
68657 ^ as now was drawing near the time of the promise
68664 ^ that had made - god - to abraham,
68670 ^ increased the people
68673 ^ and multiplied in egypt,
68677 ^ until that there arose king another over egypt,
68684 ^ who not knew - joseph.
68689 ^ he
68690 ^ having dealt treacherously with the race of us, he mistreated the fathers of us,
68698 ^ - making [them] the infants abandon
68703 ^ of them
68704 ^ unto the not
68707 ^ they would live.
68708 ^ in that time was born moses,
68713 ^ and he was beautiful - to god,
68718 ^ who was brought up months three in the house of the father.
68727 ^ having been set outside then he,
68730 ^ took up him the daughter of pharaoh,
68735 ^ and brought up him for herself for a son.
68741 ^ and was instructed moses in all [the] wisdom of [the] egyptians;
68748 ^ he was now mighty in words and deeds of him.
68756 ^ when then was fulfilled to him of forty years a period,
68762 ^ it came into the mind of him
68767 ^ to visit the brothers of him, the sons of israel.
68774 ^ and
68775 ^ having seen a certain one
68777 ^ being wronged, he defended [him]
68779 ^ and did vengeance
68782 ^ for the [one] being oppressed,
68784 ^ having struck down the egyptian.
68787 ^ he was supposing now
68789 ^ to understand the brothers of him
68793 ^ that - god by [the] hand of him is giving salvation them,
68802 ^ - but not they understood.
68806 ^ on the and
68913 ^ terrified then having become moses, not he dared
68919 ^ to look.
68920 ^ said then to him the lord,
68925 ^ take off the sandal of the feet of you,
68931 ^ - for
68933 ^ the place
68934 ^ on which you stand, ground holy is.
68940 ^ having seen, i saw the oppression of the people of me - in egypt,
68950 ^ and the groans of them i have heard,
68955 ^ and i have come down
68957 ^ to deliver them;
68959 ^ and now come,
68962 ^ i will send you to egypt.’
68966 ^ this - moses,
68969 ^ whom they rejected,
68971 ^ having said,
68972 ^ who you appointed ruler and judge?’ —
68978 ^ him whom god [as] and ruler and redeemer sent by [the] hand of [the] angel
68989 ^ - having appeared to him in the bush —
68995 ^ this one led out them,
68998 ^ having done wonders and signs in [the] land of egypt, and in [the] red sea, and in the wilderness years forty.
69015 ^ this is the moses
69019 ^ - having said to the sons of israel,
69024 ^ a prophet for you will raise up - god out from the brothers of you, like me.’
69035 ^ this is
69037 ^ the [one] having been in the congregation in the wilderness, with the angel
69048 ^ - speaking to him in the mount sinai, and of the fathers of us,
69059 ^ who received oracles
69062 ^ living
69063 ^ to give to us,
69345 ^ hearing now these things, they were cut in the hearts of them
69352 ^ and began gnashing the teeth at him.
69358 ^ he being however full of [the] spirit holy,
69363 ^ having looked intently into - heaven, saw [the] glory of god and jesus
69372 ^ standing at the right hand - of god,
69377 ^ and he said,
69379 ^ behold,
69380 ^ i see the heavens
69383 ^ having been opened, and the son - of man
69389 ^ at the right [hand] standing
69392 ^ - of god.
69394 ^ having cried out then in a voice loud, they held the ears of them
69402 ^ and rushed with one accord upon him,
69407 ^ and
69408 ^ having cast [him] out of the city, they began to stone [him].
69413 ^ and the witnesses laid aside the garments of them at the feet of a young man
69424 ^ named saul.
69426 ^ and [as] they were stoning - stephen,
69430 ^ he was calling out
69431 ^ and saying,
69433 ^ lord jesus, receive the spirit of me.
69439 ^ having fallen then on [his] knees, he cried in a voice loud,
69446 ^ lord, not place to them this - sin.
69453 ^ and
69454 ^ this having said, he fell asleep.
69457 ^ saul now was there
69460 ^ consenting to the killing of him.
69464 ^ arose then on that - day a persecution great against the church which [was] in jerusalem.
69478 ^ all then were scattered throughout the regions - of judea and samaria, except the apostles.
69491 ^ buried now - stephen men devout,
69497 ^ and made lamentation great over him.
69503 ^ saul however was destroying the church;
69508 ^ [houses] after - houses entering,
69512 ^ dragging off then men and women, he was delivering [them] to prison.
69520 ^ those indeed therefore
69523 ^ having been scattered went about,
69525 ^ preaching the word.
69528 ^ philip now,
69530 ^ having gone down to - [a] city - of samaria, was proclaiming to them the christ.
69540 ^ were giving heed now the crowds
69544 ^ to the things being spoken by - philip with one accord,
69550 ^ in the [time] to hear them
69554 ^ and to see the signs
69558 ^ that he was performing.
69560 ^ many for
69566 ^ crying voice in a loud, they were coming out [of them];
69570 ^ many now,
69572 ^ having been paralyzed and lame, were healed.
69576 ^ there was then great joy in the city that.
69584 ^ a man now
69586 ^ certain, named simon, had been formerly
69590 ^ in the city practicing sorcery
69594 ^ and amazing the people - of samaria,
69600 ^ declaring
69601 ^ to be someone himself
69604 ^ great,
69605 ^ to whom were giving heed all, from small to great,
69612 ^ saying,
69613 ^ this one is the power - of god
69619 ^ that [is] called great.
69622 ^ they were giving heed now to him,
69625 ^ because the long time with the magic arts he had amazed them.
69633 ^ when however they believed - philip,
69638 ^ proclaiming the gospel concerning the kingdom - of god, and the name of jesus christ,
69649 ^ they were baptized, men both and women.
69654 ^ - and
69656 ^ simon also
69658 ^ himself believed,
69660 ^ and
69661 ^ having been baptized, was
69663 ^ steadfastly continuing - with philip.
69666 ^ beholding then [the] signs and miracles great
69672 ^ being performed, he was amazed.
69674 ^ having heard now the in jerusalem apostles
69680 ^ that had received - samaria the word - of god, they sent to them peter and john,
69694 ^ who
69695 ^ having come down, prayed for them
69699 ^ that they might receive [the] spirit holy.
69703 ^ not yet for he was
69706 ^ upon any of them fallen;
69710 ^ only however
69712 ^ baptized they had been into the name of the lord jesus.
69720 ^ then they began laying the hands upon them,
69726 ^ and they received [the] spirit holy.
69730 ^ having seen now - of simon
69734 ^ that through the laying on of the hands of the apostles was given the spirit, he offered to them money,
69748 ^ saying,
69749 ^ give also to me the authority this,
69754 ^ that
69755 ^ on whom if i may lay the hands, he may receive [the] spirit holy.
69763 ^ peter however said to him,
69768 ^ the silver of you, with you may it be to destruction,
69776 ^ because
69777 ^ the gift - of god you thought by money to be obtained!
69785 ^ no there is to you part,
69789 ^ nor lot, in the matter this;
69795 ^ the for
69797 ^ heart of you not is right before - god.
69805 ^ repent therefore of the wickedness of yours this,
69812 ^ and pray earnestly to the lord,
69816 ^ if indeed will be forgiven you the intent of the heart of you;
69835 ^ answering now, - simon said,
69840 ^ pray earnestly you on behalf of me to the lord,
69847 ^ so that nothing may come upon me
69947 ^ having run up then, - philip heard him
69953 ^ reading isaiah the prophet,
69957 ^ and said,
69959 ^ then also understand you
69962 ^ what you are reading?
69964 ^ - and he said,
69967 ^ how for - could i be able
69971 ^ if not someone will guide me?
69976 ^ he invited then - philip,
69980 ^ having come up, to sit with him.
69984 ^ - now
69986 ^ the passage of the scripture
69989 ^ which he was reading was this:
69993 ^ as a sheep to slaughter he was led,
69998 ^ and as a lamb
70001 ^ before the [one] shearing him [is] silent,
70006 ^ so not he opens the mouth of him. in the humiliation of him,
70016 ^ - justice from him was taken away.
70020 ^ the generation of him, who will describe?
70025 ^ for is removed from the earth the life of him.”
70033 ^ answering now, the eunuch - to philip said,
70040 ^ i pray you,
70042 ^ concerning whom the prophet says this?
70048 ^ concerning himself,
70050 ^ or concerning other some?
70054 ^ having opened then - philip
70058 ^ the mouth of him
70061 ^ and having begun from the scripture this, he proclaimed the good news to him — - jesus.
70071 ^ as then they were going along the road,
70077 ^ they came upon some water,
70081 ^ and says the eunuch,
70085 ^ behold
70086 ^ water;
70087 ^ what prevents
70089 ^ me to be baptized?”
70091 ^ and he commanded
70093 ^ to stop the chariot.
70096 ^ and they went down both to the water,
70102 ^ - both philip and the eunuch,
70108 ^ and he baptized him.
70111 ^ when now they came up out of the water,
70117 ^ [the] spirit of [the] lord carried away - philip,
70122 ^ and not saw him no longer the eunuch;
70129 ^ he went for the way of him,
70134 ^ rejoicing.
70135 ^ philip however was found at azotus,
70140 ^ and
70141 ^ passing through, he was proclaiming the gospel to the towns all,
70146 ^ until - coming his to caesarea.
70152 ^ - but
70154 ^ saul,
70155 ^ still breathing out threats and murder toward the disciples of the lord,
70165 ^ having gone to the high priest, requested from him letters in damascus to the synagogues,
70177 ^ so that if any he found
70181 ^ of the way, being men both and women,
70192 ^ in now - proceeding, it came to pass
70197 ^ [as] he draws near - to damascus,
70201 ^ suddenly also him flashed around a light from - heaven.
70209 ^ and
70210 ^ having fallen on the ground, he heard a voice
70216 ^ saying to him,
70218 ^ saul, saul, why me do you persecute?
70223 ^ he said then,
70225 ^ who are you, lord?
70228 ^ - and [he said],
70230 ^ i am jesus,
70233 ^ whom you are persecuting.
70236 ^ but rise up
70238 ^ and enter into the city,
70243 ^ and it will be told you
70279 ^ leading by the hand then him, they brought [him] to damascus.
70285 ^ and he was
70287 ^ days three without seeing,
70291 ^ and neither did he eat
70294 ^ nor drink.
70296 ^ there was now a certain disciple in damascus named ananias.
70304 ^ and said to him in a vision the lord,
70312 ^ ananias.
70313 ^ - and he said,
70316 ^ behold
70317 ^ me, lord.
70319 ^ - and
70321 ^ the lord to him [said],
70324 ^ having risen up, go into the street
70329 ^ - called straight,
70332 ^ and seek in [the] house of judas saul named, of tarsus.
70340 ^ behold for
70342 ^ he is praying,
70343 ^ and he saw a man in a vision
70348 ^ ananias named,
70350 ^ having come
70351 ^ and having put on him the hands,
70356 ^ so that he might see again.
70358 ^ answered but ananias,
70361 ^ lord, i have heard from many concerning the man this,
70369 ^ how many evils to saints of you he did in jerusalem;
70377 ^ and here he has authority from the chief priests
70585 ^ having taken [him] however the disciples of him by night, through the wall they let down him,
70596 ^ having lowered [him] in a basket.
70599 ^ having arrived then in jerusalem, he was attempting
70604 ^ to join the disciples.
70607 ^ and all were afraid of him,
70611 ^ not believing
70613 ^ that he is a disciple.
70616 ^ barnabas however,
70618 ^ having taken him, brought [him] to the apostles,
70624 ^ and he related to them
70627 ^ how on the road he had seen the lord,
70634 ^ and that he had spoken to him,
70638 ^ and how in damascus he had spoken boldly in the name - of jesus.
70648 ^ and he was
70650 ^ with them, coming in
70653 ^ and going out in jerusalem,
70657 ^ speaking boldly in the name of [the] lord.
70663 ^ he was speaking also
70665 ^ and was debating with the hellenists;
70670 ^ - but they were seeking
70673 ^ to kill him.
70675 ^ having known [it] however, the brothers brought down him to caesarea
70683 ^ and sent away him to tarsus.
70688 ^ the indeed then
70691 ^ church throughout all - of judea, and galilee, and samaria, had peace,
70702 ^ being edified
70703 ^ and
70704 ^ going on in the fear of the lord; and in the comfort of the holy spirit they were multiplied.
70716 ^ it came to pass that now
70718 ^ peter,
70719 ^ passing through all [quarters], went down also to the saints
70727 ^ - inhabiting lydda.
70730 ^ he found then there a man certain, named aeneas,
70737 ^ for years eight lying on a bed,
70743 ^ who was
70745 ^ paralyzed.
70746 ^ and said to him - peter,
70751 ^ aeneas, heals you jesus christ;
70756 ^ rise up,
70757 ^ and make the bed for yourself.
70760 ^ and immediately he rose up.
70763 ^ and saw him
70766 ^ all those inhabiting lydda and - sharon,
70773 ^ who turned to the lord.
70778 ^ in joppa now certain there was
70783 ^ a disciple named tabitha,
70786 ^ which
70787 ^ translated is called dorcas.
70790 ^ she was full of works good, and of alms
70797 ^ that she continually did.
70799 ^ it came to pass however,
70801 ^ in the days those,
70805 ^ [that] having become sick, she died.
70808 ^ having washed [her] then, put [her] they in an upper room.
70814 ^ near now being lydda
70818 ^ - joppa,
70820 ^ the disciples,
70822 ^ having heard
70823 ^ that peter is in it, sent two men to him,
70833 ^ imploring ,
70834 ^ not to delay
70836 ^ coming to us.
70839 ^ having risen up then, peter went with them,
70844 ^ who
70845 ^ having arrived, brought [him] into the upper room.
70850 ^ and stood by him
70853 ^ all the widows,
70856 ^ weeping
70857 ^ and
70858 ^ showing [the] tunics and garments
70862 ^ that had made,
70864 ^ with them being, - dorcas.
70869 ^ having put then
70871 ^ outside all - peter,
70875 ^ and having bowed the knees, he prayed.
70880 ^ and
70881 ^ having turned to the body he said,
70886 ^ tabitha, arise!
70888 ^ - and she opened the eyes of her,
70894 ^ and
70895 ^ having seen - peter, she sat up.
70899 ^ having given then her [his] hand, he raised up her.
70905 ^ having called then the saints and the widows, he presented her
70914 ^ living.
70915 ^ known then it became throughout all - of joppa,
70922 ^ and believed many on the lord.
70928 ^ it came to pass then,
70930 ^ days many he stayed in joppa with a certain simon, a tanner.
70939 ^ a man now
70941 ^ certain in caesarea, named cornelius, [was] a centurion of [the] cohort
70949 ^ that is called italian, devout
70953 ^ and fearing - god with all the household of him,
70962 ^ doing alms many to the people,
70967 ^ and praying to god continually all.
70973 ^ he saw in a vision clearly, as if about hour the ninth of the day, an angel - of god
70986 ^ having come to him
70989 ^ and having said to him,
70992 ^ cornelius!
70993 ^ - and
70995 ^ having looked intently on him,
70997 ^ and afraid having become, he said,
71001 ^ what is it, lord?
71004 ^ he said then to him,
71007 ^ the prayers of you and the alms of you have ascended as a memorial before - god.
71020 ^ and now send men to joppa
71026 ^ and summon simon, a man
71030 ^ who is called peter.
71033 ^ he lodges with a certain simon a tanner,
71039 ^ whose is
71041 ^ [the] house by [the] sea.”
71044 ^ when then had departed the angel
71049 ^ - speaking to him,
71052 ^ having called two of the servants and a soldier devout
71059 ^ of those who are attending him,
71062 ^ and having related all things to them, he sent them to - joppa.
71071 ^ on the now
71073 ^ next day, as are journeying these
71076 ^ and the city approaching,
71080 ^ went up peter on the housetop
71085 ^ to pray, about hour the sixth.
71089 ^ he became then hungry
71092 ^ and desired
71094 ^ to eat;
71095 ^ [as] were preparing however they,
71098 ^ fell upon him a trance,
71102 ^ and he beholds - heaven
71106 ^ opening, and
71108 ^ descending a vessel certain,
71111 ^ as a sheet great,
71114 ^ by four corners being let down upon the earth,
71120 ^ in which were all the quadrupeds, and creeping things of the earth, and birds of heaven.
71134 ^ and came a voice to him:
71139 ^ having risen up, peter, kill
71142 ^ and eat!
71144 ^ - and
71146 ^ peter said,
71148 ^ in no way, lord;
71150 ^ for never have i eaten anything common or unclean.
71157 ^ and a voice [came] again for the second time to him:
71254 ^ having gone down then peter to the men, he said,
71261 ^ behold,
71262 ^ i am
71264 ^ whom you seek;
71266 ^ what [is] the cause
71269 ^ for which you are here?
71272 ^ - and they said,
71275 ^ cornelius a centurion, a man righteous
71279 ^ and fearing - god,
71283 ^ being well testified to then by all the nation of the jews, was divinely instructed by an angel holy
71295 ^ to send for you to the house of him,
71301 ^ and to hear a message from you.
71306 ^ having called in therefore them he lodged [them].
71310 ^ on the now
71312 ^ next day
71313 ^ having risen up, he went forth with them,
71317 ^ and some of the brothers those from joppa went with him.
71326 ^ on the now
71328 ^ next day, he entered into - caesarea,
71333 ^ - and
71335 ^ cornelius was
71337 ^ expecting them,
71339 ^ having called together the relatives of him and - close friends.
71347 ^ as then was
71350 ^ - entering - peter,
71354 ^ having met him - cornelius,
71358 ^ having fallen at the feet, worshiped [him].
71363 ^ - but
71365 ^ peter lifted up him,
71368 ^ saying,
71369 ^ rise up,
71370 ^ also i myself a man am.
71375 ^ and
71376 ^ talking with him, he entered,
71379 ^ and he finds
71381 ^ having gathered together many.
71383 ^ he was saying then to them,
71387 ^ you know
71389 ^ how unlawful it is
71392 ^ for a man a jew
71394 ^ to unite himself
71395 ^ or to come near to a foreigner.
71398 ^ to me however god has shown,
71402 ^ not common or unclean to call
71407 ^ man.
71408 ^ therefore also without objection i came,
71412 ^ having been summoned.
71413 ^ i inquire therefore,
71415 ^ for what reason did you summon me?
71419 ^ and - cornelius was saying,
71423 ^ ago four days, until this the hour, i was
71431 ^ at the ninth hour praying in the house of me;
71438 ^ and behold,
71440 ^ a man stood before me in apparel bright,
71447 ^ and said,
71449 ^ cornelius, has been heard your - prayer,
71454 ^ and the alms of you have been remembered before - god.
71462 ^ send therefore to joppa
71466 ^ and call for simon,
71469 ^ who is called peter;
71472 ^ he lodges in [the] house of simon, a tanner by [the] sea.
71480 ^ at once therefore i sent to you;
71485 ^ you then well did,
71489 ^ having come.
71490 ^ now therefore, all we before - god are present
71498 ^ to hear
71499 ^ all the things having been commanded you by the lord.
71506 ^ having opened then peter the mouth, he said,
71512 ^ of a truth i understand
71515 ^ that not is one who shows partiality - god,
71521 ^ but in every nation,
71525 ^ the [one] fearing him
71528 ^ and working righteousness, acceptable to him is,
71534 ^ the word
71536 ^ that he sent to the sons of israel,
71541 ^ proclaiming the gospel, peace by jesus christ —
71546 ^ he is of all lord.
71550 ^ you yourselves know the having come declaration through all - judea,
71559 ^ having begun from - galilee, after the baptism
71566 ^ that proclaimed john:
71569 ^ jesus - from nazareth,
71573 ^ how anointed him - god spirit with holy and with power,
71582 ^ who went about
71584 ^ doing good
71585 ^ and healing
71587 ^ all those being oppressed by the devil,
71593 ^ because - god was with him.
71599 ^ and we [are] witnesses of all things
71603 ^ that he did in both the region of the jews and in jerusalem,
71614 ^ whom also they put to death,
71617 ^ having hanged [him] on a tree.
71620 ^ this one - god raised up on the third day,
71628 ^ and gave him
71631 ^ manifest to become,
71633 ^ not to all the people,
71637 ^ but to [the] witnesses
71639 ^ - having been chosen beforehand by - god, to us
71645 ^ who did eat with
71647 ^ and drink with him
71650 ^ after - rising his out from [the] dead.
71656 ^ and he instructed us
71659 ^ to proclaim to the people
71662 ^ and to testify fully
71664 ^ that he is
71667 ^ the [one] having been appointed by - god [as] judge
71673 ^ of living and dead.
71676 ^ to him all the prophets bear witness
71681 ^ [that] forgiveness of sins receives through the name of him
71688 ^ everyone - believing in him.
71693 ^ still speaking - of peter the words these,
71700 ^ fell the spirit - holy
71705 ^ upon all those hearing the word.
71711 ^ and were amazed the from [the] circumcision believers,
71717 ^ as many as had come with - peter,
71721 ^ that even upon the gentiles the gift of the holy spirit has been poured out.
71732 ^ they were hearing for them
71735 ^ speaking in tongues
71737 ^ and magnifying - god.
71741 ^ then answered peter,
71744 ^ if not
71745 ^ the water is able to withhold anyone
71750 ^ - not
71752 ^ to baptize these
71754 ^ who the spirit - holy have received,
71760 ^ just as also [have] we?
71763 ^ he commanded now them
71766 ^ in the name of jesus christ to be baptized.
71772 ^ then they asked him
71775 ^ to remain days some.
71778 ^ heard now the apostles and the brothers
71785 ^ - being in - judea
71790 ^ that also the gentiles had received the word - of god.
71799 ^ when also went up peter to jerusalem,
71805 ^ began contending with him those of [the] circumcision,
71811 ^ saying
71812 ^ -, you went to men
71816 ^ uncircumcision having,
71818 ^ and ate with them.
71821 ^ having begun now peter, he set [it] forth to them in order,
71827 ^ saying,
71828 ^ i was
71830 ^ in [the] city of joppa praying,
71834 ^ and i saw in a trance a vision,
71839 ^ descending a vessel certain
71842 ^ like a sheet great,
71845 ^ by four corners being let down out of - heaven,
71851 ^ and it came down as far as me.
71855 ^ on it having looked intently, i was observing [it],
71859 ^ and i saw the quadrupeds of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the birds of the air.
71876 ^ i heard then also a voice
71880 ^ saying to me,
71882 ^ having risen up, peter, kill
71885 ^ and eat.
71887 ^ i said however,
71889 ^ in no way, lord,
71891 ^ for common or unclean nothing ever has entered into the mouth of me.
71901 ^ answered however the voice for a second [time] out of - heaven,
72007 ^ in then - beginning my
72012 ^ to speak, fell the spirit - holy upon them,
72020 ^ even as also upon us in [the] beginning.
72026 ^ i remembered then the word of the lord,
72032 ^ how he had said,
72034 ^ john indeed baptized with water;
72038 ^ you however will be baptized with [the] spirit holy.
72044 ^ if then the same gift has given to them - god
72053 ^ as also to us
72056 ^ having believed on the lord jesus christ,
72062 ^ i how
72064 ^ was able
72066 ^ to forbid - god?
72069 ^ having heard then these things, they were silent
72073 ^ and glorified - god,
72077 ^ saying,
72078 ^ then indeed also to the gentiles - god - repentance unto life has given.
72253 ^ having risen up now one of them named agabus, he signified by the spirit [that]
72264 ^ a famine great is about
72267 ^ to be over all the world —
72272 ^ which came to pass under claudius.
72276 ^ - and
72278 ^ the disciples,
72279 ^ as was prospered anyone,
72282 ^ determined each of them,
72285 ^ for ministry, to send to the
72289 ^ dwelling in - judea brothers,
72294 ^ which also they did,
72297 ^ having sent [it] to the elders by [the] hand of barnabas and saul.
72306 ^ at that now
72309 ^ - time, put forth herod the king the hands
72317 ^ to mistreat some of those of the church.
72323 ^ he put to death then james, the brother of john, with the sword.
72330 ^ having seen now
72332 ^ that pleasing it is
72335 ^ to the jews, he proceeded
72338 ^ to take also peter —
72341 ^ these were now the days of the unleavened [bread] —
72347 ^ whom also having seized, he put in prison,
72353 ^ having delivered [him] to four sets of four soldiers
72357 ^ to guard him,
72359 ^ intending
72360 ^ after the passover to bring out him to the people.
72367 ^ - indeed therefore
72370 ^ peter was kept in the prison;
72375 ^ prayer however was
72378 ^ fervent being made by the church to - god concerning him.
72388 ^ when then was about
72391 ^ to bring forth him - herod,
72395 ^ the night that, was - peter
72401 ^ sleeping between two soldiers,
72405 ^ having been bound with chains two,
72408 ^ guards also before the door were watching the prison.
72416 ^ and behold,
72418 ^ an angel of [the] lord stood by,
72421 ^ and a light shone in the cell.
72427 ^ having struck then the side - of peter, he woke up him,
72435 ^ saying,
72436 ^ rise up in haste.
72439 ^ and fell of him the chains off the hands.
72447 ^ said then the angel to him,
72453 ^ gird yourself about
72454 ^ and put on the sandals of you.
72459 ^ he did and so.
72462 ^ and he says to him,
72465 ^ wrap around [you] the cloak of you
72469 ^ and follow me.
72472 ^ and
72473 ^ having gone forth, he was following
72475 ^ and not did know
72478 ^ that real is
72481 ^ what is happening by means of the angel;
72486 ^ he was thinking however
72488 ^ a vision he saw.
72490 ^ having passed through then a first guard and a second, they came to the gate - iron
72502 ^ - leading into the city,
72507 ^ which by itself opened to them.
72511 ^ and
72512 ^ having gone out they went on through street one,
72516 ^ and immediately departed the angel from him.
72523 ^ and - peter
72526 ^ to himself having come, said,
72530 ^ now i know truly
72533 ^ that has sent forth the lord the angel of him
72540 ^ and delivered me out of [the] hand of herod and all the expectation of the people of the jews.
72554 ^ having considered [it] also, he came to the house of mary the mother of john,
72565 ^ who is called mark,
72568 ^ where were many
72571 ^ having gathered together
72572 ^ and praying.
72574 ^ having knocked then of him [at] the door of the gate,
72581 ^ came a girl
72583 ^ to answer,
72584 ^ named rhoda.
72586 ^ and
72587 ^ having recognized the voice - of peter, from - joy not she opened the gate,
72599 ^ having run in; but she reported
72602 ^ to be standing - peter before the gate.
72608 ^ - and to her they said,
72613 ^ you are out of your mind.
72614 ^ - but she kept insisting
72617 ^ [it] so to be.
72619 ^ - and they kept saying,
72622 ^ the angel it is
72625 ^ of him.
72626 ^ - but
72628 ^ peter continued
72630 ^ knocking;
72631 ^ having opened [it] then, they saw him
72635 ^ and were amazed.
72637 ^ having made a sign then to them with the hand
72642 ^ to be silent, he related to them
72645 ^ how the lord him had brought out of the prison.
72653 ^ he said then,
72655 ^ report to james and to the brothers these things.
72661 ^ and
72662 ^ having gone out, he went to another place.
72667 ^ having come now day,
72670 ^ there was disturbance no small among the soldiers,
72677 ^ what then [of] - peter has become.
72682 ^ herod then
72684 ^ having sought after him,
72686 ^ and not having found [him],
72689 ^ having examined the guards, he commanded [them]
72693 ^ to be led away [to death].
72694 ^ and
72695 ^ having gone down from - judea to caesarea, he stayed [there].
72702 ^ he had been now
72704 ^ furiously angry with [the] tyrians and sidonians;
72708 ^ with one accord then they came to him.
72713 ^ and
72714 ^ having gained blastus, who [was] over the bedchamber of the king, they were seeking peace,
72724 ^ because of - being nourished their - region by the king’s.
72733 ^ on the appointed now
72735 ^ day, - herod,
72738 ^ having put on apparel royal
72741 ^ and having sat on the throne, was making an address to them.
72749 ^ - and
72751 ^ the people were crying out,
72753 ^ of a god [this is the] voice,
72755 ^ and not of a man!
72758 ^ immediately then struck him an angel of [the] lord,
72764 ^ in return for that not he gave the glory - to god;
72772 ^ and
72773 ^ having been eaten by worms, he breathed his last.
72776 ^ - but
72778 ^ the word - of god continued to grow
72782 ^ and to multiply.
72784 ^ barnabas then
72786 ^ and saul returned, to jerusalem
72791 ^ having fulfilled the mission,
72794 ^ having taken with [them] john,
72796 ^ the [one] having been called mark.
72799 ^ there were now in antioch, in the
72805 ^ being [there] church, prophets and teachers, - both barnabas and simeon
72815 ^ who was called niger, and lucius the cyrenian, manaen also — herod the tetrarch brought up with — and saul.
72830 ^ as were ministering now they to the lord
72835 ^ and fasting,
72837 ^ said the spirit - holy,
72842 ^ set apart then to me - barnabas and saul for the work
72852 ^ to which i have called them.
72855 ^ then
72856 ^ having fasted,
72857 ^ and having prayed,
72859 ^ and having laid the hands on them, they sent [them] off.
72865 ^ they indeed therefore
72868 ^ having been sent forth by the holy spirit, went down to seleucia.
72876 ^ from there then they sailed to cyprus.
72881 ^ and
72882 ^ having come into salamis, they began proclaiming the word - of god in the synagogues of the jews.
72895 ^ they had now also john [as] a helper.
72900 ^ having passed through now all the island, as far as paphos, they found a man — a certain magician, a false prophet jewish —
72913 ^ whose name [was] bar-jesus,
72916 ^ who was with the proconsul sergius paulus, man an intelligent.
72925 ^ he
72926 ^ having called to [him] barnabas and saul, desired
72931 ^ to hear the word - of god.
72936 ^ was opposing however them elymas the magician —
72942 ^ thus for means the name of him —
72948 ^ seeking
72949 ^ to turn away the proconsul from the faith.
72955 ^ saul then,
73029 ^ having sailed then from - paphos [with] those around [him], paul came to perga - of pamphylia.
73042 ^ john however
73044 ^ having departed from them, returned to jerusalem.
73050 ^ they now,
73052 ^ having passed through from - perga, came to antioch - of pisidia,
73061 ^ and
73062 ^ having gone into the synagogue on the day of the sabbaths, they sat down.
73071 ^ after then
73073 ^ the reading of the law and of the prophets, sent the rulers of the synagogue to them,
73085 ^ saying,
73086 ^ men, brothers, if any there is among you
73093 ^ a word of exhortation toward the people,
73098 ^ speak.
73099 ^ having risen up then paul,
73102 ^ and having made a sign with the hand, he said,
73107 ^ men, israelites,
73109 ^ and those fearing - god, listen.
73115 ^ the god of the people this of israel chose the fathers of us,
73125 ^ and the people exalted in the sojourn in [the] land of egypt,
73135 ^ and with arm uplifted, brought them out of it,
73143 ^ and of about forty years for a period he endured the ways their in the wilderness,
73152 ^ and
73153 ^ having destroyed nations seven in [the] land of canaan, he gave as an inheritance the land of them — during years four hundred and fifty.
73168 ^ and after these things, he gave [them] judges until samuel the prophet.
73177 ^ then they asked for a king,
73180 ^ and gave to them - god, - saul son of kish, a man of [the] tribe of benjamin, years forty.
73195 ^ and
73196 ^ having removed him, he raised up - david to them as king,
73204 ^ to whom also he said,
73207 ^ having carried witness:
73208 ^ i have found david the [son] of jesse a man according to the heart of me,
73218 ^ who will do all the will of me.
73224 ^ of this [man] - god,
73227 ^ of the seed, according to promise, has brought - to israel [the] savior jesus —
73237 ^ having proclaimed john before [the] face of the coming of him a baptism of repentance to all the people of israel.
73250 ^ while then was fulfilling john the course,
73256 ^ he was saying,
73337 ^ having taken [him] down from the tree, they put [him] in a tomb.
73344 ^ - but
73346 ^ god raised him out from [the] dead,
73351 ^ who appeared for days many
73356 ^ to those having come up with him from - galilee to jerusalem,
73364 ^ who now are witnesses of him to the people.
73372 ^ and we to you preach the gospel, the to the fathers promise
73381 ^ having been made,
73382 ^ that this - god has fulfilled, to the children of them, to us,
73391 ^ having raised up jesus,
73393 ^ as also in the psalm it has been written,
73399 ^ the second:
73401 ^ son of me are you,
73405 ^ i today have begotten you.’
73409 ^ that then he raised him out from [the] dead,
73415 ^ no more being about
73417 ^ to return to decay,
73420 ^ thus he spoke
73422 ^ -: i will give to you the holy [blessings] of david, the sure [blessings].’
73430 ^ therefore also in another he says:
73435 ^ not you will allow the holy one of you
73440 ^ to see decay.’
73442 ^ david indeed for
73445 ^ in his own generation having served the - of god purpose, fell asleep
73453 ^ and was added to the fathers of him,
73459 ^ and saw decay.
73586 ^ having seen however the jews the crowds, they were filled with jealousy
73594 ^ and began contradicting
73596 ^ the things by paul
73599 ^ spoken,
73600 ^ blaspheming.
73601 ^ having spoken boldly also, - paul and - barnabas said,
73654 ^ hearing [it] then, the gentiles were rejoicing
73659 ^ and glorifying the word of the lord,
73665 ^ and believed
73667 ^ as many as were
73669 ^ appointed to life eternal.
73673 ^ was carried then the word of the lord through all the region.
73683 ^ the but
73685 ^ jews incited the
73688 ^ worshipping women - of honorable position, and the principals of the city,
73697 ^ and they stirred up a persecution against - paul and barnabas,
73705 ^ and expelled them from the district of them.
73712 ^ - but
73714 ^ having shaken off the dust of the feet against them, they went to iconium;
73724 ^ - and
73726 ^ the disciples were filled with joy and [the] spirit holy.
73732 ^ it came to pass now
73734 ^ in iconium, according to the same entered they into the synagogue of the jews
73746 ^ and spoke so
73749 ^ that believed of jewish both and greeks a great number.
73757 ^ the however
73832 ^ having become aware, they fled to the cities - of lycaonia, lystra, and derbe, and the surrounding region,
73845 ^ and there
73846 ^ preaching the gospel they continued.
73848 ^ and a certain man crippled, in lystra,
73854 ^ in the feet, was sitting,
73857 ^ lame from [the] womb of [the] mother of him,
73862 ^ who never had walked.
73865 ^ this [man] heard - paul
73869 ^ speaking,
73870 ^ who,
73871 ^ having looked intently at him
73873 ^ and having seen
73875 ^ that he has faith
73878 ^ - to be healed, said in a loud voice,
73883 ^ stand on the feet of you upright!
73889 ^ and he sprang up
73891 ^ and began to walk.
73893 ^ - and
73895 ^ the crowds
73896 ^ having seen
73897 ^ what had done paul, lifted up the voice of them
73904 ^ in lycaonian, saying,
73906 ^ the gods,
73908 ^ having become like men, have come down to us.
73913 ^ they began calling then - barnabas zeus,
73918 ^ - and
73920 ^ paul hermes,
73922 ^ because he was
73925 ^ the leading - speaker.
73929 ^ - and
73931 ^ the priest - of zeus,
73934 ^ - being just outside the city,
73939 ^ oxen and wreaths to the gates having brought,
73946 ^ with the crowds was desiring to sacrifice.
73951 ^ having heard however, the apostles barnabas and paul,
73958 ^ having torn the garments of them, rushed out into the crowd,
73966 ^ crying out
73967 ^ and saying,
73969 ^ men, why these things do you?
73973 ^ also we
73975 ^ of like nature are
74075 ^ having risen up, he entered into the city.
74080 ^ and on the next day he went away with - barnabas to derbe.
74089 ^ having proclaimed the gospel to then
74091 ^ the city that,
74094 ^ and having discipled many, they returned to - lystra, and to iconium, and to antioch,
74107 ^ strengthening the souls of the disciples,
74112 ^ exhorting [them]
74113 ^ to continue in the faith,
74116 ^ and that
74118 ^ through many tribulations it behooves us to enter into the kingdom - of god.
74129 ^ having chosen now for them in every church elders,
74135 ^ having prayed, with fasting they committed them to the lord,
74142 ^ in whom they had believed.
74145 ^ and
74146 ^ having passed through - pisidia, they came to - pamphylia,
74153 ^ and
74154 ^ having spoken in perga the word, they went down to attalia.
74162 ^ and from there they sailed to antioch,
74166 ^ from where they had
74168 ^ been committed to the grace - of god for the work
74176 ^ that they had fulfilled.
74178 ^ having arrived now
74180 ^ and having gathered together the church, they began declaring
74185 ^ all that had done - god with them,
74191 ^ and that he had opened to the gentiles a door of faith.
74198 ^ they remained then time no little with the disciples.
74206 ^ and certain ones
74208 ^ having come down from - judea were teaching the brothers
74215 ^ -, if not you are circumcised according to the custom - of moses,
74223 ^ not you are able
74225 ^ to be saved.
74226 ^ having been brought about then commotion and discussion no small - by paul and - barnabas with them,
74240 ^ they appointed
74241 ^ to go up paul and barnabas and certain others out from them, to the apostles and elders, to jerusalem, about the question this.
74261 ^ they indeed therefore
74264 ^ having been sent forward by the church were passing through - both phoenicia and samaria,
74274 ^ relating in detail the conversion of the gentiles,
74279 ^ and they were bringing joy great to all the brothers.
74286 ^ having come then to jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders.
74300 ^ they declared then
74302 ^ all that - god had done with them.
74308 ^ rose up now certain of those of the sect of the pharisees
74317 ^ who believed,
74318 ^ saying
74319 ^ -, it is necessary
74321 ^ to circumcise them,
74323 ^ to command [them] then
74325 ^ to keep the law of moses.
74329 ^ were gathered together then the apostles and the elders
74336 ^ to see about the matter this.
74341 ^ of much now
74343 ^ discussion having taken place,
74345 ^ having risen up, peter said to them,
74350 ^ men, brothers, you know
74354 ^ that from days early, among you chose - god
74363 ^ by the mouth of me to hear the gentiles the word of the gospel,
74374 ^ and to believe.
74376 ^ and the heart-knowing god bore witness to them,
74382 ^ having given [them] the spirit - holy,
74387 ^ as also to us,
74390 ^ and not one he made distinction between us also and them,
74398 ^ by the faith having purified the hearts of them.
74404 ^ now therefore, why are you testing - god,
74410 ^ to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples
74417 ^ that neither the fathers of us, nor we, have been able
74425 ^ to bear?
74426 ^ but by the grace of [the] lord jesus, we believe
74434 ^ to be saved,
74435 ^ in [the] same manner [as] they also.
74439 ^ kept silent now all the multitude,
74444 ^ and were listening to barnabas and paul
74449 ^ relating
74450 ^ what had done - god,
74454 ^ signs and wonders, among the gentiles by them.
74462 ^ after now - were silent they, answered james,
74469 ^ saying,
74470 ^ men, brothers, hear me.
74474 ^ simeon has related
74476 ^ how first - god visited,
74481 ^ to take out of [the] gentiles a people for the name of him.
74488 ^ and with this agree the words of the prophets,
74495 ^ as it is written:
74497 ^ after these things i will return
74500 ^ and will rebuild the tabernacle of david
74505 ^ which has fallen,
74507 ^ and
74508 ^ the ruins of it i will rebuild,
74512 ^ and i will set upright it,
74515 ^ so that - may seek out the remnant - of men the lord,
74524 ^ and all the gentiles,
74528 ^ upon whom has been called the name of me upon them,
74536 ^ says [the] lord,
74538 ^ doing these things, known from eternity.’
74543 ^ therefore i judge
74546 ^ not to trouble
74548 ^ those who, from the gentiles,
74552 ^ are turning to - god,
74556 ^ but to write to them
74559 ^ - to abstain from the pollutions of the idols, and - sexual immorality, and that which is strangled, and from blood.
74574 ^ moses for from generations of old, in every city
74581 ^ [ones] proclaiming him has,
74585 ^ in the synagogues on every sabbath being read.
74592 ^ then it seemed good to the apostles and to the elders, with all the church,
74603 ^ having chosen men out from them, to send to antioch with - paul and barnabas:
74615 ^ judas
74616 ^ - called barsabbas, and silas, men
74622 ^ leading among the brothers,
74626 ^ having written by [the] hand of them:
74630 ^ the apostles and the elders, brothers, to those in - antioch and syria and cilicia, brothers - among the gentiles:
74648 ^ greetings.
74649 ^ inasmuch as we have heard
74651 ^ that some
74653 ^ from us went out troubled you by words,
74659 ^ upsetting the minds of you,
74663 ^ to whom not we had given instructions,
74666 ^ it seemed good to us
74668 ^ having come with one accord,
74670 ^ having chosen men, to send to you, with the beloved of us, barnabas and paul, men
74683 ^ having handed over the lives of them for the name of the lord of us, jesus christ.
74695 ^ we have sent therefore judas and silas,
74700 ^ and they
74702 ^ by word [of mouth] are telling [you] the same things.
74707 ^ it seemed good for to the spirit - holy and to us,
74715 ^ no further to lay upon you
74719 ^ burden, except these - necessary things:
74724 ^ to abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from sexual immorality.
74732 ^ from these keeping yourselves, well you will do.
74738 ^ farewell.
74739 ^ they indeed therefore,
74742 ^ having been sent off, went to antioch,
74746 ^ and
74747 ^ having gathered the multitude, they delivered the letter.
74753 ^ having read [it] now, they rejoiced at the encouragement.
74759 ^ judas both and silas,
74763 ^ also themselves prophets being, by talk much exhorted the brothers
74773 ^ and strengthened [them].
74775 ^ having continued then a time, they were sent away in peace from the brothers
74784 ^ to those having sent them.
74788 ^ paul however
74790 ^ and barnabas stayed in antioch,
74795 ^ teaching
74796 ^ and proclaiming the good news, with also others many, the word of the lord.
74806 ^ after now
74808 ^ some days, said to barnabas, paul,
74814 ^ having turned back indeed let us look after the brothers in city every
74822 ^ in which we have announced the word of the lord,
74829 ^ how they are.
74831 ^ barnabas now purposed
74834 ^ to take along also - john
74838 ^ - called mark;
74841 ^ paul however thought fit,
74844 ^ the [one] having withdrawn from them from pamphylia
74850 ^ and not having gone with them to the work,
74857 ^ not to take along him.
74860 ^ arose therefore a sharp disagreement,
74863 ^ so that separated they from one another;
74868 ^ - and
74870 ^ barnabas,
74871 ^ having taken - mark, sailed to cyprus.
74877 ^ paul however,
74879 ^ having chosen silas, went forth,
74882 ^ having been committed to the grace of the lord by the brothers.
74890 ^ he was passing through then - syria and - cilicia,
74897 ^ strengthening the churches.
74900 ^ he came then also to derbe and to lystra.
74908 ^ and behold,
74910 ^ a disciple certain was there,
74914 ^ named timothy, [the] son of a woman jewish believing,
74920 ^ father however a greek,
74923 ^ who was well spoken of by the in lystra and iconium brothers.
75012 ^ having come then down to - mysia, they were attempting
75018 ^ into - bithynia to go;
75022 ^ and not did allow them the spirit of jesus;
75029 ^ having passed by then - mysia, they came down to troas.
75036 ^ and a vision during the night - to paul appeared:
75044 ^ a man of macedonia certain was
75048 ^ standing
75049 ^ and beseeching him
75052 ^ and saying,
75054 ^ having passed over into macedonia, help us.
75059 ^ when now the vision he had seen,
75064 ^ immediately we sought
75066 ^ to go forth to macedonia,
75069 ^ concluding
75070 ^ that had called us - god
75075 ^ to preach the gospel to them.
75077 ^ having sailed then from troas, we made a straight course to samothrace,
75084 ^ - and the following day, to nea polis,
75090 ^ and from there to philippi,
75093 ^ which is [the] leading district of the of macedonia city, a colony.
75101 ^ we were now
75103 ^ in this - city staying days some.
75110 ^ on the then
75112 ^ day of the sabbaths, we went forth outside the city gate, by a river,
75171 ^ having entered into the house of me, abide.
75177 ^ and she persuaded us.
75180 ^ it happened now,
75182 ^ going of us to the [place of] prayer,
75187 ^ a girl certain,
75189 ^ having a spirit of python, met us,
75194 ^ who gain much was bringing the masters of her
75201 ^ by fortune-telling.
75202 ^ she,
75203 ^ having followed - paul and us, was crying out,
75209 ^ saying,
75210 ^ these - men servants of the god - most high are,
75219 ^ who proclaim to you [the] way of salvation.
75224 ^ this then she continued for many days.
75230 ^ having been distressed then paul,
75233 ^ and having turned to the spirit, he said,
75238 ^ i command you in [the] name of jesus christ
75244 ^ to come out from her.
75247 ^ and it came out [the] same - hour.
75252 ^ having seen now the masters of her
75257 ^ that was gone the hope of the profit of them,
75264 ^ having taken hold of - paul and - silas, they dragged [them] into the marketplace before the rulers;
75277 ^ and
75278 ^ having brought up them to the magistrates, they said,
75283 ^ these - men exceedingly trouble of us the city,
75290 ^ jews being,
75292 ^ and preach customs,
75295 ^ that not it is lawful for us
75299 ^ to accept
75300 ^ nor
75301 ^ to practice,
75302 ^ romans being.
75304 ^ and rose up together the crowd against them,
75310 ^ and the magistrates
75313 ^ having torn off of them the garments, were commanding that
75318 ^ they be beaten with rods.
75319 ^ many then having laid on them blows, they cast [them] into prison,
75327 ^ having charged the jailer
75330 ^ securely to keep them,
75333 ^ who
75334 ^ an order such having received, threw them into the inner prison,
75343 ^ and the feet fastened
75347 ^ of them in the stocks.
75351 ^ toward now
75353 ^ - midnight, paul and silas,
75358 ^ praying, were singing praises to - god.
75362 ^ were listening now to them the prisoners.
75367 ^ suddenly then earthquake there was
75371 ^ a great,
75372 ^ so that were shaken the foundations of the prison house;
75378 ^ were opened then immediately the doors all,
75384 ^ and of all, the chains were loosed.
75389 ^ awoken then
75391 ^ having been the jailer,
75394 ^ and having seen
75396 ^ open the doors of the prison,
75401 ^ having drawn his sword, he was about
75405 ^ himself to kill,
75407 ^ supposing
75408 ^ to have escaped the prisoners.
75411 ^ called out however
75413 ^ loud
75414 ^ in a voice,
75415 ^ -
75416 ^ paul
75417 ^ saying,
75418 ^ not do to yourself
75421 ^ harm;
75422 ^ all for we are here.
75426 ^ having called for now lights, he rushed in,
75430 ^ and
75431 ^ terrified having become, he fell down before - paul and - silas.
75439 ^ and
75440 ^ having brought them out he was saying,
75444 ^ sirs,
75445 ^ what of me is necessary to do,
75449 ^ that i may be saved?
75451 ^ - and they said,
75454 ^ believe on the lord jesus,
75459 ^ and you will be saved, you
75462 ^ and the household of you.
75466 ^ and they spoke to him the word of the lord, along with all those in the house of him.
75480 ^ and
75481 ^ having taken them in that - hour of the night, he washed [them] from the wounds;
75493 ^ and he was baptized, he
75496 ^ and the [household] of him all immediately.
75501 ^ having brought then them into the house, he laid a table [for them],
75509 ^ and rejoiced with all [his] household,
75512 ^ having believed - in god.
75515 ^ day then having come,
75518 ^ sent the magistrates the officers,
75523 ^ saying,
75524 ^ release the men those.
75528 ^ reported then the jailer the words these to - paul
75538 ^ -: have sent the captains,
75542 ^ that you may be let go.
75544 ^ now therefore
75546 ^ having gone out, depart in peace.
75550 ^ - but
75552 ^ paul was saying to them,
75556 ^ having beaten us publicly,
75559 ^ uncondemned men,
75561 ^ romans being, they cast [us] into prison,
75566 ^ and now secretly us do they throw out?
75571 ^ no indeed!
75573 ^ instead,
75574 ^ having come themselves, us let them bring out.
75578 ^ reported then to the captains the officers the words these.
75587 ^ they were afraid then,
75589 ^ having heard
75590 ^ that romans they are.
75593 ^ and
75594 ^ having come, they appealed to them,
75597 ^ and
75598 ^ having brought [them] out, they were asking [them]
75600 ^ to go out of the city.
75604 ^ having gone forth then out of the prison, they came to - lydia;
75613 ^ and
75614 ^ having seen [them], they exhorted the brothers
75618 ^ and departed.
75620 ^ having passed through then - amphipolis and - apollonia, they came to thessalonica,
75630 ^ where was a synagogue of the jews.
75635 ^ according to now
75637 ^ the custom - with paul, he went in to them,
75644 ^ and for sabbaths three he reasoned with them from the scriptures,
75653 ^ opening
75654 ^ and setting forth
75656 ^ that
75657 ^ the christ it behooved
75660 ^ to have suffered,
75661 ^ and to have risen out from [the] dead,
75665 ^ and that this is the christ
75671 ^ - jesus,
75673 ^ whom i preach to you.
75677 ^ and some of them were obedient
75682 ^ and joined themselves - to paul and - to silas, - along with
75728 ^ not having found however them, they dragged jason and certain brothers before the city authorities,
75740 ^ crying out
75741 ^ -,
75742 ^ the [ones] the world
75745 ^ having upset, these
75747 ^ also here are come,
75750 ^ whom has received jason.
75753 ^ and these all, contrary to the decrees of caesar do,
75997 ^ having taken hold also of him, to the ares hill they brought [him],
76005 ^ saying,
76006 ^ are we able
76007 ^ to know
76008 ^ what [is] the new this, which
76013 ^ by you is spoken, teaching?
76050 ^ having stood then - paul in [the] midst of the ares hill, he was saying,
76060 ^ men, athenians, in all things as very religious you i behold.
76068 ^ passing through for
76070 ^ and beholding the objects of worship of you, i found even an altar
76078 ^ on which had been inscribed:
76081 ^ to an unknown god.
76083 ^ whom therefore
76085 ^ not knowing you worship,
76087 ^ him i proclaim to you.
76091 ^ the god
76093 ^ - having made the world and all things that [are] in it,
76102 ^ he
76103 ^ of heaven and earth being
76107 ^ lord, not in hand-made temples dwells,
76113 ^ nor by hands of men is he served,
76118 ^ as needing anything,
76120 ^ himself giving to all life and breath, and the all;
76129 ^ he made then of one, every nation of men,
76136 ^ to dwell upon all the face of the earth,
76142 ^ having determined
76143 ^ [the] appointed times and the boundaries of the habitation of them,
76151 ^ to seek - god,
76154 ^ if perhaps indeed they might palpate for him,
76159 ^ and might find him.
76161 ^ and indeed, not far from one each of us he is.
76170 ^ in him for we live
76174 ^ and move
76176 ^ and are.’
76178 ^ as also some of the among you poets have said,
76186 ^ of [him] for also
76189 ^ offspring we are.’
76191 ^ offspring therefore being - of god, not we ought
76198 ^ to consider
76199 ^ to gold, or to silver, or to stone, a graven thing, of craft and imagination of man, the divine being to be
76212 ^ like.
76213 ^ the indeed therefore times - of ignorance having overlooked - god, - now he commands - men
76227 ^ all everywhere to repent,
76230 ^ because he set a day
76252 ^ having heard of now a resurrection of [the] dead, some indeed began to mock [him];
76259 ^ some however said,
76262 ^ we will hear you concerning this also again.
76268 ^ thus - paul went out from [the] midst of them.
76275 ^ some however
76277 ^ men,
76278 ^ having joined themselves to him, believed,
76281 ^ among whom also [were] dionysius the areopagite, and a woman named damaris, and others with them.
76295 ^ and after these things,
76297 ^ having departed from - athens, he came to corinth.
76304 ^ and
76305 ^ having found a certain jew named aquila, of pontus - a native,
76313 ^ recently having come from - italy, and priscilla wife of him,
76322 ^ because of - having commanded claudius
76326 ^ to depart all the jews out of - rome, he came to them,
76335 ^ and
76336 ^ due to of the same trade
76339 ^ being, he stayed with them
76343 ^ and worked;
76345 ^ they were for tentmakers by the trade.
76350 ^ he was reasoning now in the synagogue on every sabbath,
76358 ^ persuading both jews and greeks.
76363 ^ when now came down from - macedonia - both silas and - timothy,
76375 ^ was occupied with the word - paul,
76380 ^ earnestly testifying to the jews
76383 ^ to be the christ jesus.
76387 ^ opposing however of them
76390 ^ and reviling [him],
76392 ^ having shaken out the garments, he said to them,
76398 ^ the blood of you [be] upon the head of you;
76405 ^ clean i [am].
76407 ^ from - now on, to the gentiles i will go.
76414 ^ and
76415 ^ having departed from there he came to [the] house of a certain one named titius justus,
76424 ^ worshiping - god,
76427 ^ of whom the house was
76431 ^ adjoining the synagogue.
76434 ^ crispus now,
76436 ^ the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the lord, with all the household of him.
76446 ^ and many of the corinthians
76450 ^ hearing, believed
76452 ^ and were baptized.
76454 ^ said now the lord in [the] night through a vision - to paul,
76464 ^ not fear,
76466 ^ but continue speaking,
76468 ^ and not be silent,
76471 ^ because i am with you,
76476 ^ and no one will lay a hand on you
76480 ^ - to harm you,
76483 ^ because people there are
76486 ^ to me many in the city this.
76492 ^ he remained now a year and months six,
76498 ^ teaching among them the word - of god.
76505 ^ gallio however proconsul being
76509 ^ of achaia,
76511 ^ rose up against with one accord the jews - paul,
76517 ^ and led him to the judgment seat,
76523 ^ saying
76524 ^ -,
76525 ^ contrary to the law, persuades this [man] - men to worship - god.
76535 ^ being about now - paul
76539 ^ to open the mouth,
76542 ^ said - gallio to the jews,
76548 ^ if indeed it was unrighteousness some or crime wicked,
76556 ^ o jews, according to reason - i would have endured with you;
76563 ^ if however a question it is about a word, and names, and law - in reference to your,
76576 ^ you will see [to it] yourselves;
76590 ^ having seized then all [of them] sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, they began to beat [him] before the judgment seat.
76600 ^ and nothing about these things - to gallio it mattered.
76606 ^ - now
76608 ^ paul,
76609 ^ more having remained days many, the brothers
76615 ^ having taken leave of, sailed away to - syria —
76620 ^ and with him priscilla and aquila —
76626 ^ having shaved in cenchrea the head;
76631 ^ he had for a vow.
76634 ^ they came now to ephesus,
76638 ^ and them left there.
76641 ^ he himself then
76643 ^ having entered into the synagogue, he reasoned with the jews.
76650 ^ asking [him] now of them
76653 ^ for a longer time to remain,
76657 ^ not he did consent,
76659 ^ but
76660 ^ having taken leave
76661 ^ and having said,
76663 ^ again i will return to you,
76667 ^ - god willing, he sailed from - ephesus,
76674 ^ and
76675 ^ having landed at caesarea,
76678 ^ having gone up
76679 ^ and having greeted the church, he went down to antioch.
76686 ^ and
76687 ^ having stayed time some, he went forth,
76691 ^ passing through successively the galatian region and phrygia,
76698 ^ strengthening all the disciples.
76702 ^ a jew now
76704 ^ certain, apollos named, of alexandria - a native, a man eloquent, came to ephesus,
76715 ^ mighty being in the scriptures.
76720 ^ he was
76722 ^ instructed in the way of the lord.
76727 ^ and
76728 ^ being fervent - in spirit, he was speaking
76732 ^ and was teaching earnestly the things concerning - jesus,
76739 ^ knowing only the baptism of john.
76744 ^ he then began
76747 ^ to speak boldly in the synagogue.
76751 ^ having heard however him priscilla and aquila, they took to [them] him
76759 ^ and more accurately to him expounded the way of god.
76767 ^ resolving then he
76770 ^ to pass through into - achaia,
76774 ^ having encouraged [him], the brothers wrote to the disciples
76780 ^ to welcome him,
76782 ^ who
76783 ^ having arrived, helped greatly
76786 ^ those having believed through - grace.
76791 ^ powerfully for the jews he was refuting publicly,
76797 ^ showing by the scriptures
76801 ^ to be the christ jesus.
76805 ^ it came to pass now,
76807 ^ while - - apollos
76811 ^ was in corinth, paul
76815 ^ having passed through the upper parts to come down to ephesus,
76822 ^ and having found certain disciples,
76826 ^ he said also to them,
76830 ^ if [the] spirit holy did you receive,
76834 ^ having believed?
76835 ^ - and [they said] to him,
76839 ^ but not even
76841 ^ that [a] spirit holy there is, did we hear.
76846 ^ he said then,
76848 ^ into what then were you baptized?
76852 ^ - and they said,
76855 ^ into - john's baptism.
76859 ^ said then paul,
76862 ^ john baptized a baptism of repentance,
76866 ^ the people telling
76869 ^ in the [one] coming after him that they should believe,
76876 ^ that is, in - jesus.
76881 ^ having heard then, they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus.
76890 ^ and having laid on them - paul the hands,
76897 ^ came the spirit - holy upon them;
76904 ^ they were speaking then in tongues
76907 ^ and prophesying.
76909 ^ there were then the in all men about twelve.
76916 ^ having entered then into the synagogue, he was speaking boldly for months three,
76925 ^ reasoning
76926 ^ and persuading - concerning the kingdom - of god.
76934 ^ when however some were hardened
76938 ^ and were disbelieving,
76940 ^ speaking evil of the way before the multitude,
76946 ^ having departed from them, he took separately the disciples,
76952 ^ every day reasoning in the lecture hall of tyrannus.
76959 ^ this then continued for years two,
76965 ^ so that
76966 ^ all those inhabiting - asia heard the word of the lord,
76976 ^ jews both and greeks.
76980 ^ miracles then
77056 ^ answering however, the spirit - evil said to them
77064 ^ -, -
77066 ^ jesus i know,
77068 ^ and - paul i am acquainted with;
77072 ^ you however, who are you?
77076 ^ and
77077 ^ having leapt the man on them
77182 ^ having passed through - macedonia and achaia, to go to jerusalem,
77190 ^ having said
77191 ^ -,
77192 ^ after - having been my there, it behooves
77198 ^ me also rome to see.
77202 ^ having sent then into - macedonia two
77208 ^ of those ministering to him, timothy and erastus, he remained for a time in - asia.
77220 ^ arose now at the time same a disturbance not small concerning the way.
77232 ^ demetrius for
77234 ^ a certain [man] named, a silversmith,
77237 ^ making shrines silver of artemis, was bringing to the craftsmen no little business,
77247 ^ whom having brought together,
77249 ^ also the in such things workmen, he said,
77256 ^ men, you know
77258 ^ that from this - business the wealth of us is.
77267 ^ and you see
77269 ^ and hear
77271 ^ that not only in ephesus, but almost all - of asia, - paul, this
77283 ^ having persuaded [them], has turned away a great many people,
77287 ^ saying
77288 ^ that not they are gods
77292 ^ - by hands
77295 ^ being made.
77296 ^ not only but this is endangered to us, the business
77304 ^ into disrepute to come,
77307 ^ but also
77309 ^ the of the great goddess artemis temple for nothing to be reckoned,
77318 ^ to be and also
77321 ^ deposed the majesty of her,
77325 ^ whom all - asia and the world worship.
77333 ^ having heard then
77335 ^ and having become full of rage, they were crying out,
77340 ^ saying,
77341 ^ great [is] - artemis of [the] ephesians.
77345 ^ and was filled the city whole with confusion;
77351 ^ they rushed and with one accord to the theatre,
77357 ^ having dragged off gaius and aristarchus, macedonians, fellow travelers of paul.
77364 ^ of paul however intending
77367 ^ to go in to the people,
77371 ^ not would allow him the disciples.
77376 ^ some then also
77379 ^ of the asiarchs,
77381 ^ being to him friends,
77384 ^ having sent to him, were urging [him]
77388 ^ not to venture himself into the theatre.
77394 ^ others indeed therefore some thing were crying out;
77400 ^ was for the assembly
77404 ^ confused,
77405 ^ and - most not did know
77410 ^ for what cause they were assembled.
77413 ^ out of now
77415 ^ the crowd to explain himself alexander,
77419 ^ having thrust forward him the jews.
77423 ^ - and
77425 ^ alexander,
77426 ^ having motioned with the hand, was wanting
77430 ^ to make a defense to the people.
77433 ^ having recognized however
77435 ^ that a jew he is, a cry there was
77440 ^ one from all,
77443 ^ about ongoing hours two crying out,
77448 ^ great [is] - artemis of [the] ephesians.
77452 ^ having calmed then the town clerk the crowd, he says,
77459 ^ men, ephesians, what for is there
77464 ^ man
77465 ^ who not knows the of [the] ephesians city
77471 ^ temple-keeper as being
77473 ^ of the great artemis, and of that fallen from the sky?
77479 ^ undeniable therefore being these things,
77561 ^ after now - had ceased the uproar,
77567 ^ having called to [him] - paul
77570 ^ the disciples
77572 ^ and having encouraged,
77574 ^ having said farewell, he departed
77576 ^ to go to macedonia.
77579 ^ having passed through then
77581 ^ the districts those,
77584 ^ and having exhorted them with talk much, he came to - greece.
77593 ^ having continued then months three,
77597 ^ having been made a plot against him by the jews,
77603 ^ he being about
77604 ^ to sail into - syria, arose a purpose
77610 ^ - to return through macedonia.
77614 ^ was accompanied by then he sopater pyrrhus, a berean; of the thessalonians now, aristarchus and secundus; and gaius of derbe and timothy; [the] asians now, tychicus and trophimus.
77635 ^ these also
77637 ^ having gone ahead, waited for us in troas.
77642 ^ we then sailed away after the days of the unleavened bread, from philippi,
77652 ^ and we came to them at - troas within days five,
77662 ^ where we stayed days seven.
77666 ^ in then
77668 ^ the first [day] of the week, having come together we
77674 ^ to break bread,
77676 ^ - paul talked to them,
77680 ^ about
77681 ^ to depart on the next day;
77684 ^ he continued then the talk until midnight.
77690 ^ there were now lamps many in the upper room
77717 ^ having been overpowered by the sleep, he fell from the third story down,
77726 ^ and was picked up dead.
77729 ^ having descended however, - paul fell upon him,
77735 ^ and
77736 ^ having embraced [him], said,
77738 ^ not be alarmed,
77740 ^ the for
77742 ^ life of him in him is.
77747 ^ having gone up then,
77749 ^ and having broken the bread,
77753 ^ and having eaten,
77755 ^ for long and having talked until daybreak, so he departed.
77763 ^ they brought then the boy
77767 ^ alive,
77768 ^ and were comforted not a little.
77772 ^ we however,
77774 ^ having gone ahead to the ship, sailed to - assos,
77801 ^ having taken in him, we came to mitylene.
77806 ^ and from there having sailed away,
77808 ^ on the following [day] we arrived opposite chios;
77813 ^ - then
77815 ^ the next [day] we arrived at samos;
77819 ^ the now following [day] we came to miletus.
77825 ^ had decided for - paul
77829 ^ to sail by - ephesus,
77832 ^ so that not it might come upon to him
77836 ^ to spend time in - asia;
77840 ^ he was hastened for,
77842 ^ if possible it was
77845 ^ for him,
77846 ^ on the day - of pentecost to be in jerusalem.
77853 ^ from then
77855 ^ - miletus,
77857 ^ having sent to ephesus, he called for the elders of the church.
77865 ^ when then they had come to him,
77870 ^ he said to them,
77872 ^ you know
77874 ^ from the first day
77877 ^ on which i arrived in - asia,
77883 ^ how with you the whole time i was,
77890 ^ serving the lord with all humility, and tears, and trials
77900 ^ - having befallen me in the plots of the jews;
77908 ^ how nothing i did shrink back
77943 ^ bound i in the spirit go to jerusalem,
78170 ^ by thus straining it behooves [us]
78173 ^ to aid
78174 ^ those being weak,
78176 ^ to remember and also the words of the lord jesus,
78183 ^ how he himself said,
78186 ^ blessed it is
78188 ^ more to give
78190 ^ than to receive.
78192 ^ and
78193 ^ these things having said,
78195 ^ having bowed the knee of him, with all them he prayed.
78203 ^ much then
78205 ^ weeping there was
78207 ^ among all;
78208 ^ and
78209 ^ having fallen upon the neck - of paul, they were kissing him,
78217 ^ sorrowing especially over the word
78222 ^ that he had spoken,
78224 ^ that no more they are about
78227 ^ the face of him to see.
78231 ^ they accompanied then him to the ship.
78237 ^ after then it happened
78240 ^ sailing our,
78242 ^ having drawn away from them,
78245 ^ having run directly we came to - cos,
78250 ^ - and
78252 ^ the next [day] to - rhodes,
78256 ^ and from there to patara.
78259 ^ and
78260 ^ having found a boat
78262 ^ passing over into phoenicia,
78265 ^ having gone on board, we set sail.
78267 ^ having sighted then
78269 ^ - cyprus
78271 ^ and having left it on the left, we kept sailing to syria
78278 ^ and landed at tyre.
78282 ^ there for the ship was
78287 ^ unloading the cargo.
78290 ^ having sought out then the disciples, we remained there days seven,
78298 ^ who - to paul kept telling through the spirit
78305 ^ not to go up to jerusalem.
78309 ^ when then it happened that
78312 ^ we had completed the days,
78316 ^ having set out, we journeyed,
78318 ^ accompanying us all with wives and children, as far as outside the city.
78329 ^ and
78330 ^ having bowed the knees on the shore,
78336 ^ having prayed, having said farewell to one another,
78339 ^ then we went up into the boat;
78344 ^ they then returned to the own.
78350 ^ we then,
78352 ^ the voyage having completed from tyre, came down to ptolemais,
78360 ^ and
78361 ^ having greeted the brothers, we stayed day one with them.
78369 ^ on the now
78371 ^ next day,
78372 ^ having gone forth, we came to caesarea;
78376 ^ and
78377 ^ having entered into the house of philip the evangelist,
78384 ^ being of the seven, we stayed with him.
78391 ^ with this [man] now there were
78394 ^ daughters four, virgins,
78397 ^ prophesying.
78398 ^ remaining now days many,
78402 ^ came down a certain one from - judea,
78407 ^ a prophet named agabus;
78410 ^ and
78411 ^ having come to us,
78414 ^ and having taken the belt - of paul,
78420 ^ having bound of himself the feet and the hands, he said,
78428 ^ thus says the spirit - holy,
78434 ^ the man
78436 ^ of whom is the belt this, in this way will bind in jerusalem the jews
78447 ^ and will deliver [him] into [the] hands of [the] gentiles.
78452 ^ when then we had heard these things,
78456 ^ began begging we both and those of that place,
78462 ^ - not
78464 ^ to go up him to jerusalem.
78468 ^ then answered - paul,
78472 ^ what are you doing,
78474 ^ weeping
78475 ^ and breaking my - heart?
78480 ^ i for
78482 ^ not only to be bound,
78485 ^ but also to die at jerusalem, readiness have, for the name of the lord jesus.
78498 ^ not being persuaded then of him,
78502 ^ we were silent,
78503 ^ having said,
78504 ^ of the lord the will be done.
78509 ^ after now
78511 ^ the days these,
78514 ^ having packed the baggage, we started on our way up to jerusalem.
78518 ^ went then also [some] of the disciples from caesarea with us,
78527 ^ bringing [one]
78528 ^ with whom we would lodge, mnason, a certain cypriot, an early disciple.
78536 ^ having arrived now we at jerusalem,
78541 ^ gladly received us the brothers.
78546 ^ on the now following [day], went in - paul with us unto james,
78556 ^ all and arrived
78559 ^ the elders.
78561 ^ and
78562 ^ having greeted them, he began to relate, by one each,
78568 ^ the things had done - god among the gentiles through the ministry of him.
78579 ^ those then
78581 ^ having heard began glorifying - god.
78585 ^ they said then to him,
78588 ^ you see, brother,
78590 ^ how many myriads there are among the jews
78650 ^ these [men] having taken, be purified with them
78655 ^ and bear expense for them,
78659 ^ so that they will shave the head,
78663 ^ and will know all
78666 ^ that
78667 ^ of which they have been informed about you nothing is,
78673 ^ but you walk orderly also yourself,
78677 ^ keeping the law.
78680 ^ concerning now
78682 ^ those
78683 ^ having believed of the gentiles, we wrote,
78687 ^ having adjudged
78688 ^ to keep from them, the things both sacrificed to idols, and blood, and what is strangled, and sexual immorality.
78699 ^ then - paul,
78702 ^ having taken the men, on the
78706 ^ following day,
78708 ^ with them having been purified, entered into the temple,
78715 ^ declaring the fulfillment of the days of the purification
78722 ^ until that was offered for one each of them the sacrifice.
78731 ^ when now were about the seven days
78737 ^ to be completed,
78738 ^ the from - asia jews,
78743 ^ having seen him in the temple, began stirring up all the crowd
78752 ^ and laid upon him the hands,
78758 ^ crying out,
78759 ^ men, israelites, help!
78762 ^ this is the man
78766 ^ who against the people and the law and the place this all those everywhere
78779 ^ teaching;
78780 ^ besides and also greeks he has brought into the temple
78788 ^ and defiled the holy place this.
78794 ^ it was they for
78796 ^ having previously seen trophimus the ephesian in the city with him,
78805 ^ whom they were supposing
78807 ^ that into the temple had brought - paul.
78814 ^ was thrown into commotion also the city whole,
78819 ^ and there was a rushing together of the people.
78824 ^ and
78825 ^ having laid hold - of paul, they dragged him outside the temple,
78833 ^ and immediately were shut the doors.
78838 ^ of them seeking then
78840 ^ him to kill,
78842 ^ there came a report to the commander of the cohort
78848 ^ that all was in an uproar
78851 ^ jerusalem,
78852 ^ who at once,
78854 ^ having taken with [him] soldiers and centurions, ran down upon them.
78861 ^ - and
78863 ^ having seen the commander and the soldiers, they stopped
78870 ^ beating - paul.
78873 ^ then
78874 ^ having drawn near, the commander laid hold of him
78879 ^ and commanded [him]
78881 ^ to be bound with chains two,
78884 ^ and began inquiring
78886 ^ who he might be
78888 ^ and
78889 ^ what it is he has been doing.
78892 ^ others however, another [or] one thing were crying out in the crowd.
78900 ^ not being able now he
78904 ^ to know the facts on account of the uproar,
78910 ^ he ordered
78911 ^ to be brought him into the barracks.
78916 ^ when now he came to the stairs,
78922 ^ it happened that
78923 ^ was carried he by the soldiers, because of the violence of the crowd.
78933 ^ were following for the multitude of the people,
78939 ^ crying out,
78940 ^ away with him.
78942 ^ being about then
79220 ^ having risen up go to damascus,
79224 ^ and there you it will be told concerning all things
79229 ^ that it has been appointed you
79232 ^ to do.
79233 ^ while now, not i could see from the brightness of the light that,
79243 ^ being led by the hand
79244 ^ by those being with me, i came to damascus.
79251 ^ ananias then
79253 ^ certain, a man devout according to the law,
79259 ^ borne witness to by all the
79263 ^ dwelling [there] jews,
79265 ^ having come to me
79268 ^ and having stood by [me], said to me,
79272 ^ saul brother, receive your sight.
79275 ^ and i the same - hour looked up at him.
79282 ^ - and he said,
79285 ^ the god of the fathers of us has appointed you
79292 ^ to know the will of him,
79296 ^ and to see the righteous one,
79300 ^ and to hear [the] voice out of the mouth of him.
79307 ^ for you will be a witness for him to all men
79314 ^ of what you have seen
79316 ^ and heard.
79318 ^ and now why delay you?
79322 ^ having arisen, be baptized
79324 ^ and wash away the sins of you,
79329 ^ calling on the name of him.
79333 ^ it happened then to me,
79336 ^ having returned to jerusalem,
79339 ^ and praying of my in the temple,
79345 ^ fell i into a trance
79349 ^ and saw him
79352 ^ saying to me,
79354 ^ make haste
79355 ^ and go away with speed out of jerusalem,
79361 ^ because not they will receive your testimony about me.
79368 ^ and i said,
79370 ^ lord, they themselves know
79373 ^ that i was
79376 ^ imprisoning
79377 ^ and beating in each of those synagogues
79382 ^ those believing on you.
79386 ^ and when was poured out the blood of stephen, the witness of you,
79395 ^ also i myself was
79398 ^ standing by,
79399 ^ and consenting,
79401 ^ and watching over the garments
79405 ^ of those killing him.
79408 ^ and he said to me,
79412 ^ go,
79413 ^ for i to [the] gentiles far away will send you.
79420 ^ they were listening now to him until this - word,
79427 ^ and they lifted up the voice of them,
79432 ^ saying,
79433 ^ away with from the earth, the such.
79439 ^ not for it is fit
79442 ^ he to live!
79444 ^ were crying out then they,
79447 ^ and casting off the garments,
79451 ^ and dust throwing into the air.
79457 ^ ordered the commander
79460 ^ to be brought him into the barracks,
79465 ^ having directed
79466 ^ by flogging to be examined him,
79469 ^ so that he might know
79471 ^ for what cause like this they were crying out against him.
79477 ^ as however he stretched forward him with the straps,
79483 ^ said to the
79486 ^ standing by centurion - paul,
79490 ^ if
79491 ^ a man, a roman and uncondemned, it is lawful to you to flog?
79498 ^ having heard then the centurion,
79502 ^ having gone to the commander, he reported [it],
79506 ^ saying,
79516 ^ having come near then, the commander said to him,
79522 ^ tell me,
79524 ^ you a roman are?
79527 ^ - and he was saying,
79530 ^ yes.
79531 ^ answered then the commander,
79535 ^ i with a great sum the citizenship this bought.
79542 ^ - but
79544 ^ paul was saying,
79546 ^ i however even was born [so].
79550 ^ immediately therefore departed from him
79555 ^ those being about
79557 ^ him to examine,
79559 ^ and the commander also was afraid,
79564 ^ having ascertained
79565 ^ that a roman he is,
79568 ^ and because
79570 ^ him he had bound.
79573 ^ on the now
79575 ^ next day,
79576 ^ desiring
79577 ^ to know - for certain -
79581 ^ why he is accused by the jews, he unbound him
79588 ^ and commanded
79590 ^ to assemble the chief priests and all the council.
79597 ^ and
79598 ^ having brought down - paul, he set [him] among them.
79604 ^ having looked intently then - paul at the council, he said,
79611 ^ men, brothers, i in all conscience good have lived as a citizen - to god unto this - day.
79624 ^ - then
79626 ^ the high priest ananias commanded
79629 ^ those standing by him
79632 ^ to strike of him the mouth.
79636 ^ then - paul to him said,
79798 ^ having gone down, to take by force him from midst of them,
79804 ^ to bring [him] then into the barracks.
79809 ^ - but
79837 ^ having made a conspiracy, the jews put under an oath themselves,
79843 ^ declaring
79844 ^ neither to eat
79846 ^ nor to drink
79848 ^ until that they should kill - paul.
79853 ^ there were now more than forty,
79857 ^ - this - plot
79861 ^ having made,
79862 ^ who,
79863 ^ having come to the chief priests and the elders, said,
79870 ^ with an oath we have bound ourselves,
79873 ^ nothing to eat
79875 ^ until that we should kill - paul.
79880 ^ now therefore you, make a report to the commander along with the council,
79889 ^ so that he might bring down him to you,
79894 ^ as being about
79896 ^ to examine more earnestly the things about him;
79901 ^ we then,
79903 ^ before - drawing near his, ready are
79912 ^ having heard however the son of the sister of paul of the ambush,
79921 ^ having come near
79922 ^ and having entered into the barracks, he reported [it] - to paul.
79930 ^ having called to [him] then - paul one of the centurions, he was saying,
79938 ^ the young man this take to the commander;
79945 ^ he has for
79947 ^ to report something to him.
79950 ^ the [one] indeed therefore
79953 ^ having taken him brought [him] to the commander,
79959 ^ and he says,
79961 ^ the prisoner paul,
79964 ^ having called to me, asked [me]
79967 ^ this - young man to lead to you,
79973 ^ having
79974 ^ something to say to you.
79977 ^ having taken hold then
79979 ^ the hand of him the commander,
79984 ^ and having withdrawn in private, he began to inquire,
79989 ^ what is it
80104 ^ having written a letter,
80106 ^ having the form this:
80110 ^ claudius lysias, to the most excellent governor, felix:
80116 ^ greetings.
80117 ^ the man this,
80120 ^ having been seized by the jews,
80124 ^ and being about
80126 ^ to be killed by them,
80129 ^ having come up with the troop, i rescued [him],
80134 ^ having learned
80135 ^ that a roman he is.
80138 ^ resolving then
80371 ^ having examined [him] concerning all these things, to know
80398 ^ for many years, as being you judge to nation, this knowing, cheerfully to the things concerning myself i make a defense.
80413 ^ being able you
80415 ^ to know
80416 ^ that not more than there are to me days
80422 ^ twelve,
80423 ^ from which i went up
80426 ^ to worship in jerusalem.
80429 ^ and neither
80672 ^ frightened having become, - felix answered,
80677 ^ for the present
80679 ^ being go away;
80681 ^ opportunity then having found, i will call for you.
80686 ^ at the same time also,
80688 ^ he is hoping
80689 ^ that riches will be given him by - paul.
80696 ^ therefore also often
80699 ^ him sending for, he was talking with him.
80703 ^ two years however having been completed,
80706 ^ received [as] successor - felix,
80710 ^ porcius festus;
80712 ^ wishing then
80801 ^ having spent then with them days not more than
80808 ^ eight or ten,
80811 ^ having gone down to caesarea,
80814 ^ on the next day having sat on the judgment seat, he commanded
80821 ^ - paul to be brought.
80824 ^ having arrived then he,
80827 ^ stood around him the
80830 ^ from jerusalem having come down jews,
80834 ^ many and weighty charges bringing,
80875 ^ to jerusalem having gone up, there concerning these things to be judged before me?
80884 ^ said then - paul,
80888 ^ before the judgment seat of caesar
80892 ^ standing i am,
81034 ^ delay no having made,
81037 ^ the next [day] having sat on the judgment seat, i commanded
81044 ^ to be brought the man,
81047 ^ concerning whom,
81049 ^ having stood up, the accusers no charge were bringing
81055 ^ of which i was expecting crimes.
81059 ^ questions however
81061 ^ certain concerning the own religion they had against him,
81069 ^ and concerning a certain jesus
81073 ^ having been dead,
81079 ^ being perplexed now, i - concerning this inquiry was asking
81087 ^ if he was willing
81089 ^ to go to jerusalem
81092 ^ and there to be judged concerning these things.
81096 ^ - but
81098 ^ of paul having appealed for
81100 ^ to be kept himself for the - emperor's decision,
81107 ^ i commanded
81108 ^ to be kept him
81110 ^ until that i might send him to caesar.
81116 ^ agrippa then [said] to - festus,
81121 ^ i have been wanting also myself
81124 ^ the man to hear.
81127 ^ tomorrow,
81128 ^ he says, you will hear him.
81131 ^ on the therefore
81133 ^ next day, having come - agrippa and - bernice with great pomp,
81143 ^ and having entered into the audience hall, with both [the] commanders and men - in prominence in the city,
81158 ^ and having commanded - festus,
81162 ^ was brought in - paul.
81165 ^ and says - festus,
81169 ^ agrippa king, and all the
81174 ^ being present with us men, you see this one,
81179 ^ concerning whom all the multitude of the jews pleaded with me, in both jerusalem and here,
81193 ^ crying out [that]
81194 ^ not he ought
81196 ^ of him to live no longer.
81199 ^ i however, having understood
81202 ^ nothing worthy him
81205 ^ of death to have done,
81207 ^ himself and
81209 ^ of this one having appealed to the emperor,
81213 ^ i determined
81214 ^ to send [him],
81246 ^ [in] sending a prisoner, not also the against him charges to specify.
81255 ^ agrippa then to - paul was saying,
81261 ^ it is permitted you
81263 ^ for yourself to speak.
81266 ^ then - paul,
81269 ^ having stretched out the hand, began his defense:
81273 ^ concerning all
81275 ^ of which i am accused by [the] jews, king agrippa, i esteem myself fortunate
81441 ^ exceedingly then being furious against them, i kept persecuting [them] as far as even
81448 ^ to - foreign cities,
81452 ^ during which, journeying to - damascus with [the] authority and commission of the chief priests, day mid on the road i saw, o king, from heaven above, the brightness of the sun,
81478 ^ having shone around me, a light;
81481 ^ and those with me
81485 ^ journeying.
81486 ^ all and having fallen down
81489 ^ of us to the ground,
81493 ^ i heard a voice
81495 ^ saying to me in the hebrew language,
81501 ^ saul, saul, why me persecute you?
81506 ^ [it is] hard for you
81508 ^ against [the] goads to kick.
81511 ^ i then said,
81514 ^ who are you, lord?
81517 ^ - and
81519 ^ the lord said,
81521 ^ i am jesus,
81524 ^ whom you are persecuting.
81527 ^ but rise up
81529 ^ and stand on the feet of you;
81535 ^ for this purpose for i have appeared to you,
81540 ^ to appoint you a servant and a witness
81545 ^ of that which both you have seen of me,
81549 ^ of the things in which then i will appear to you,
81553 ^ delivering you out from the people and from the gentiles,
81562 ^ to whom i am sending you,
81567 ^ to open eyes of them,
81570 ^ that they may turn from darkness to light,
81576 ^ and from the power - of satan to - god,
81584 ^ [that] may receive they forgiveness of sins and [an] inheritance
81591 ^ among those having been sanctified by faith that [is] in me.
81598 ^ so then, o king agrippa, not i was disobedient to the heavenly vision,
81607 ^ but to those in damascus first, both and jerusalem all, and the region - of judea, and to the gentiles, i kept declaring
81625 ^ to repent
81626 ^ and to turn to - god,
81631 ^ worthy - of repentance works doing.
81636 ^ on account of these things,
81638 ^ me the jews having seized
81641 ^ being in the temple, they were attempting
81646 ^ to kill.
81647 ^ help therefore having obtained - from - god unto the day this, i have stood,
81659 ^ bearing witness to small both and to great, nothing
81665 ^ other saying
81667 ^ than what both the prophets said
81672 ^ was about
81673 ^ to happen,
81674 ^ and moses,
81676 ^ that would suffer the christ;
81680 ^ as first through resurrection from [the] dead,
81685 ^ light he is about to preach to both our people and to the gentiles.
81694 ^ these things now of him saying in his defense,
81698 ^ - festus in a loud - voice said,
81704 ^ you are insane, paul!
81706 ^ the great of you
81709 ^ learning, to insanity turns [you]!
81713 ^ - but
81715 ^ paul,
81716 ^ not i am insane, says,
81719 ^ most excellent festus, but of truth and sobriety words i utter.
81727 ^ understands for concerning these things the king,
81733 ^ to whom also
81736 ^ using boldness i speak.
81873 ^ having boarded then a ship of adramyttium
81877 ^ being about
81878 ^ to sail to the along - asia places, we set sail —
81886 ^ being with us aristarchus, a macedonian of thessalonica.
81892 ^ the then
81894 ^ next [day], we landed at sidon.
81898 ^ considerately then - julius, - paul having treated, allowed [him]
81906 ^ to his friends having gone, care to receive.
81912 ^ and from there
81913 ^ having set sail, we sailed under - cyprus,
81917 ^ because of - the winds
81921 ^ being contrary.
81923 ^ - and then - along - cilicia and pamphylia, having sailed across [the sea], we came to myra - of lycia.
81938 ^ and there,
81939 ^ having found the centurion a ship of alexandria
81944 ^ sailing to - italy, he placed us into it.
81952 ^ for many now
81955 ^ days, sailing slowly
81957 ^ and with difficulty, having arrived off - cnidus,
81963 ^ not permitting us the wind, we sailed under - crete, off salmone.
81973 ^ with difficulty and coasting along it, we came to a place certain
81981 ^ called fair havens,
81984 ^ to which near [the] city was
81988 ^ of lasea.
81989 ^ much now
81991 ^ time having passed,
81993 ^ and being already dangerous the voyage,
81999 ^ because of - even the fast already
82005 ^ being over,
82006 ^ was admonishing [them] - paul,
82009 ^ saying to them,
82011 ^ men, i understand
82013 ^ that
82014 ^ with disaster and much loss, not only of the cargo and of the ship, but also the lives of us, is about to be the voyage.
82035 ^ - but
82037 ^ the centurion by the pilot and the ship owner rather was persuaded,
82045 ^ than
82046 ^ by the things by paul
82049 ^ spoken.
82050 ^ unsuitable now the harbor being to winter in,
82057 ^ the majority reached a decision
82061 ^ to set sail from there,
82063 ^ if somehow they might be able,
82066 ^ having arrived at phoenix, to winter [there] — a harbor - of crete,
82073 ^ looking toward [the] southwest and toward [the] northwest.
82079 ^ having blown gently now a south wind,
82082 ^ having thought
82083 ^ the purpose to have obtained,
82086 ^ having weighed [anchor], very near they began coasting along - crete.
82091 ^ after not long however, there came down from it a wind tempestuous,
82100 ^ - called the northeaster.
82103 ^ having been caught then the ship,
82107 ^ and not being able
82110 ^ to face to the wind,
82113 ^ having given way we were driven along.
82115 ^ an island then certain having run under,
82119 ^ called cauda, we were able with difficulty
82123 ^ control to gain
82125 ^ of the lifeboat,
82127 ^ which having taken up, supports they began using,
82131 ^ undergirding the ship.
82134 ^ fearing then
82136 ^ lest into the sandbars of syrtis they should fall,
82141 ^ having lowered the gear, thus they were driven along.
82146 ^ violently now being storm-tossed of us, on the next [day]
82152 ^ a jettison of cargo they began to make,
82154 ^ and on the third [day], with [their] own hands the tackle of the ship they cast away.
82163 ^ neither now sun nor stars appearing for many days,
82172 ^ tempest and
82174 ^ no small lying on [us],
82177 ^ from then on was abandoned hope all
82181 ^ - being saved of us.
82184 ^ much also time without food there being,
82188 ^ at that time
82189 ^ having stood up - paul in midst of them, he said,
82196 ^ it behooved [you] indeed, o men,
82200 ^ having been obedient to me, not to have set sail from - crete,
82207 ^ to have incurred then the disaster this and - loss.
82215 ^ and yet - now i exhort you
82220 ^ to keep up your courage;
82221 ^ loss for
82223 ^ of life none there will be
82226 ^ from among you, only of the ship.
82231 ^ stood by for me this - night -, of god,
82239 ^ whose am i
82242 ^ whom and i serve, an angel,
82246 ^ saying,
82247 ^ not fear, paul;
82391 ^ until then that day was about
82396 ^ to come, kept urging - paul all
82401 ^ to partake of food,
82403 ^ saying,
82404 ^ the fourteenth today
82406 ^ [is] day
82407 ^ watching without eating you continue,
82410 ^ nothing having taken.
82412 ^ therefore i exhort you
82415 ^ to take food;
82417 ^ this indeed for - of you preservation is;
82424 ^ not one for
82426 ^ of you a hair of the head will perish.
82432 ^ having said now
82434 ^ these things
82435 ^ and having taken bread, he gave thanks - to god before all,
82443 ^ and
82444 ^ having broken [it], he began
82446 ^ to eat.
82447 ^ encouraged then having been, all also
82452 ^ themselves took food.
82455 ^ we were then the altogether souls in the ship, two hundred seventy six.
82466 ^ having been filled then with food, they began to lighten the ship,
82472 ^ casting out the wheat into the sea.
82478 ^ when now day it was,
82482 ^ the land not they did recognize;
82486 ^ a bay however
82488 ^ certain they noticed,
82490 ^ having a shore,
82524 ^ having fallen however into a place between two seas, they ran aground the vessel;
82532 ^ and the indeed
82535 ^ bow
82536 ^ having stuck fast, it remained immovable,
82539 ^ - and
82541 ^ the stern was being broken up by the violence of the waves.
82548 ^ of the now
82550 ^ soldiers, [the] plan was
82553 ^ that the prisoners they should kill,
82557 ^ lest anyone,
82559 ^ having swum away, should escape.
82561 ^ - but
82563 ^ the centurion,
82564 ^ desiring
82565 ^ to save - paul, hindered them of [the] purpose;
82572 ^ he commanded then
82574 ^ those being able
82576 ^ to swim,
82577 ^ having cast [themselves] off first, on the land to go out,
82583 ^ and the rest,
82586 ^ some indeed on boards,
82590 ^ some then on things - from the ship.
82598 ^ and thus it came to pass that
82601 ^ all were brought safely to the land.
82606 ^ and
82607 ^ having been saved, then we found out
82610 ^ that malta the island is called.
82615 ^ - and
82617 ^ the natives were showing not [just] the ordinary kindness to us.
82624 ^ having kindled for a fire, they received all of us because of the rain
82633 ^ - coming on and because of the cold.
82639 ^ having gathered now - paul of sticks a quantity,
82646 ^ and having laid [them] on the fire,
82651 ^ a viper
82652 ^ out from the heat having come, fastened on the hand of him.
82660 ^ when then saw the natives hanging the beast from the hand of him,
82672 ^ to one another they began to say,
82675 ^ by all means a murderer is the man this,
82725 ^ having changed their opinion, they began declaring
82727 ^ him to be a god.
82730 ^ in now
82732 ^ the [parts] around the place that were lands belonging to the chief of the island, named publius,
82745 ^ who
82746 ^ having received us three, days hospitably entertained [us].
82752 ^ it came to pass then,
82754 ^ the father - of publius,
82758 ^ fevers and dysentery oppressed with, was lying,
82763 ^ toward whom - paul,
82767 ^ having entered
82768 ^ and having prayed,
82770 ^ having laid the hands on him, healed him.
82776 ^ of this then having taken place,
82779 ^ also the rest
82782 ^ - in the island
82786 ^ having infirmities were coming
82789 ^ and were healed,
82791 ^ who also with many honors honored us,
82797 ^ and
82798 ^ on setting sail, they laid on [us] the things for the needs.
82804 ^ after then
82806 ^ three months, we sailed in a ship
82811 ^ having wintered in the island, alexandrian, with a figurehead of the dioscuri.
82818 ^ and
82819 ^ having put in at syracuse, we stayed days three,
82825 ^ from where
82826 ^ having gone around, we arrived at rhegium.
82830 ^ and after one day, having come on a south wind,
82836 ^ on the second day we came to puteoli,
82840 ^ where having found [some] brothers, we were entreated
82844 ^ with them to remain days seven.
82849 ^ and so to - rome we came.
82855 ^ and from there the brothers,
82858 ^ having heard the things concerning us, came out to meet us as far as of appius [the] market and [the] three taverns,
82872 ^ whom having seen - paul,
82876 ^ having given thanks to god, took courage.
82881 ^ when now we came to rome,
82886 ^ was allowed - paul
82889 ^ to stay by himself, with the
82894 ^ guarding him soldier.
82897 ^ it came to pass then,
82899 ^ after days three called together he
82904 ^ those being of the jews leaders.
82909 ^ having come together then of them,
82912 ^ he was saying to them,
82915 ^ i, men, brothers,
82918 ^ nothing against having done
82921 ^ the people or the customs - of our fathers, a prisoner from jerusalem was delivered into the hands of the romans,
82937 ^ who
82938 ^ having examined me, were wanting
82941 ^ to let [me] go,
82942 ^ on account of - not one cause of death
82947 ^ existing in me.
82950 ^ objecting however of the jews,
82954 ^ i was compelled
82955 ^ to appeal to caesar,
82957 ^ not
82958 ^ as
83030 ^ having appointed then him a day, came to him to the lodging many,
83041 ^ to whom he expounded,
83043 ^ fully testifying to the kingdom - of god,
83048 ^ persuading then them concerning - jesus from both the law of moses and the prophets, from morning to evening.
83066 ^ and some indeed were persuaded of
83070 ^ the things he is speaking;
83072 ^ some however refused to believe.
83075 ^ discordant then being with one another, they began to leave,
83081 ^ having spoken - paul word one
83086 ^ -: rightly the spirit - holy spoke by isaiah the prophet to the fathers of you,
83101 ^ saying:
83102 ^ go to the people this
83107 ^ and say,
83109 ^ in hearing you will hear
83111 ^ and no not understand;
83115 ^ and
83116 ^ in seeing you will see
83118 ^ and no not perceive.
83122 ^ has grown dull for the heart of the people this,
83129 ^ and with the ears barely they hear,
83134 ^ and the eyes of them they have closed,
83139 ^ lest ever they should see with the eyes,
83143 ^ and with the ears they should hear,
83147 ^ and with the heart they should understand,
83151 ^ and should turn,
83153 ^ and i will heal them.’
83156 ^ known therefore be it
83159 ^ to you
83160 ^ that to the gentiles has been sent this - salvation - of god;
83169 ^ they then will listen!”
83172 ^ he stayed then two years whole in his own rented house,
83179 ^ and was welcoming
83181 ^ all - coming unto him,
83186 ^ proclaiming the kingdom - of god
83191 ^ and teaching the things concerning the lord jesus christ with all boldness unhinderedly.
83203 ^ paul, a servant of christ jesus, a called apostle
83209 ^ having been set apart for [the] gospel of god,
83213 ^ which he promised beforehand through the prophets of him in [the] scriptures holy, concerning the son of him,
83226 ^ - having come of [the] seed of david according to flesh,
83233 ^ - having been declared son of god in power according to [the] spirit of holiness by resurrection [from the] dead, jesus christ, the lord of us;
83250 ^ through whom we have received grace and apostleship unto obedience of faith among all the gentiles on behalf of the name of him,
83267 ^ among whom are also you called of jesus christ.
83275 ^ to all those being in rome, beloved of god, called saints:
83284 ^ grace to you
83286 ^ and peace from god [the] father of us and [the] lord jesus christ.
83296 ^ first indeed, i thank the god of me through jesus christ for all of you,
83308 ^ because the faith of you is being proclaimed in all the world.
83317 ^ witness for
83319 ^ my is - god,
83323 ^ whom i serve in the spirit of me in the gospel of the son of him,
83335 ^ how unceasingly mention of you i make, always upon the prayers of me
83345 ^ imploring,
83346 ^ if perhaps now at last i will make a prosperous journey by the will - of god,
83356 ^ to come to you.
83359 ^ i long for
83361 ^ to see you,
83363 ^ that some i may impart
83366 ^ gift to you
83368 ^ spiritual,
83369 ^ to the strengthening of you,
83373 ^ that now is,
83376 ^ to be encouraged together among you, through the among one another faith of you both and of me.
83388 ^ not i do want now you
83392 ^ to be ignorant, brothers,
83394 ^ that many times i purposed
83397 ^ to come to you,
83400 ^ and was hindered, until the present,
83405 ^ that some fruit i might have also among you,
83412 ^ as even among the other gentiles.
83418 ^ to greeks both and to barbarians, to [the] wise both and [the] foolish, a debtor i am.
83428 ^ thus - as to me [there is] readiness
83433 ^ also to you who [are] in rome, to preach the gospel.
83439 ^ not for i am ashamed of the gospel,
83444 ^ [the] power for
83446 ^ of god it is, unto salvation
83450 ^ to everyone - believing — to jewish both first and to greek.
83458 ^ [the] righteousness for
83460 ^ of god in it is revealed, from faith to faith,
83468 ^ as it has been written:
83470 ^ - and
83472 ^ the righteous by faith will live.”
83476 ^ is revealed for [the] wrath of god from heaven upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men,
83488 ^ - the truth by unrighteousness
83493 ^ suppressing,
83494 ^ because the known - of god manifest is among them,
83503 ^ - god for to them has revealed [it].
83508 ^ the for
83510 ^ invisible qualities of him from [the] creation of [the] world,
83515 ^ by the things made being understood, are clearly seen,
83519 ^ the both eternal of him power and divinity,
83526 ^ for - to be them without excuse.
83531 ^ for
83532 ^ having known - god, not as god they glorified [him],
83539 ^ or were thankful,
83541 ^ but they became futile in the thinking of them,
83547 ^ and was darkened the foolish of them heart.
83553 ^ professing
83554 ^ to be wise, they became fools,
83557 ^ and they changed the glory of the immortal god into a likeness of an image of mortal man and birds and quadrupeds and creeping things.
83575 ^ therefore gave up them - god in the desires of the hearts of them to impurity
83588 ^ - to dishonor the bodies of them between themselves,
83595 ^ who changed the truth - of god into the falsehood,
83604 ^ and reverenced
83606 ^ and served the created thing
83610 ^ beyond the [one] having created [it],
83613 ^ who is blessed to the ages! amen.
83620 ^ because of this gave up them - god to passions of dishonor.
83629 ^ - even for
83632 ^ females of them changed the natural use into that contrary to nature.
83642 ^ likewise then also the males,
83647 ^ having left the natural use of the female, were inflamed in the desire of them toward one another,
83660 ^ males
83661 ^ with males, the shame working out,
83666 ^ and
83667 ^ the recompense
83669 ^ which was fitting of the error of them, in themselves receiving.
83677 ^ and as not they did see fit
83681 ^ - god to have in [their] knowledge,
83686 ^ gave up them - god to a depraved mind,
83693 ^ to do
83694 ^ things not being proper;
83697 ^ being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness; gossips, slanderers, hateful to god, insolent, arrogant, boastful; inventors of evil things, to parents disobedient; foolish, untrustworthy, heartless, unmerciful;
83723 ^ who
83724 ^ the righteous decree - of god having known,
83729 ^ that
83730 ^ those such things
83733 ^ doing, worthy of death are, not only them are practicing,
83741 ^ but also are approving of
83744 ^ those practicing [them].
83746 ^ therefore inexcusable you are, o man,
83751 ^ each one who is judging.
83754 ^ in that which for you judge the other, yourself you are condemning;
83762 ^ - for
83764 ^ the same things you do,
83766 ^ the [one] judging.
83768 ^ we know however
83770 ^ that the judgment - of god is according to truth,
83778 ^ upon those - such things
83782 ^ practicing.
83783 ^ suppose you now this, o man,
83788 ^ the [one] judging
83790 ^ those - such things
83793 ^ practicing,
83794 ^ and doing them [yourself],
83797 ^ that you will escape the judgment - of god?
83804 ^ or the riches of the kindness of him, and the forbearance, and the patience despise you,
83817 ^ not knowing
83818 ^ that the kindness - of god to repentance you leads?
83827 ^ because of however
83829 ^ the hardness of you and unrepentant heart, you are treasuring up to yourself wrath in [the] day of wrath and revelation of righteous judgement - of god,
83846 ^ who will give to each, according to the works of him,”
84851 ^ where now no there is law, neither [is] transgression.
84858 ^ therefore it [is] of faith,
84862 ^ that [it may be] according to grace,
84865 ^ for - to be sure the promise to all the seed, not to that of the law only, but also to that of [the] faith of abraham,
84886 ^ who is [the] father of all of us —
84891 ^ as it has been written
84893 ^ -: a father of many nations i have made
84898 ^ you.”
84899 ^ before whom he believed
84902 ^ god,
84903 ^ the [one] giving life to the dead
84907 ^ and calling
85027 ^ having been justified therefore by faith, peace we have with - god, through the lord of us jesus christ,
85042 ^ through whom also - access we have by the faith into the grace this
85054 ^ in which we stand;
85057 ^ and we boast in hope of the glory - of god.
85065 ^ not only [so] now,
85068 ^ but also we glory in - tribulations,
85074 ^ knowing
85075 ^ that - tribulation, perseverance produces;
85080 ^ - and
85082 ^ perseverance, character;
85084 ^ - and
85086 ^ character, hope.
85088 ^ - and
85090 ^ hope not does make [us] ashamed,
85093 ^ because the love - of god has been poured out into the hearts of us through [the] spirit holy,
85106 ^ the [one] having been given to us.
85109 ^ yet indeed christ,
85112 ^ being of us without strength still, according to [the] right time, for [the] ungodly died.
85121 ^ rarely indeed for a righteous [man] anyone will die;
85127 ^ on behalf of though
85129 ^ the good [man], perhaps someone even would dare
85135 ^ to die.
85136 ^ demonstrates however the of himself love to us - god,
85145 ^ that still sinners being of us,
85150 ^ christ for us died.
85154 ^ much therefore
85156 ^ more,
85157 ^ having been justified now by the blood of him, we will be saved by him from the wrath!
85169 ^ if for,
85171 ^ enemies being, we were reconciled - to god through the death of the son of him,
85182 ^ much more,
85184 ^ having been reconciled, shall we be saved in the life of him!
85190 ^ not only [so] now,
85193 ^ but also
85195 ^ we are rejoicing in - god through the lord of us jesus christ,
85205 ^ through whom now the reconciliation we have received.
85211 ^ because of this, just as through one man - sin into the world entered,
85223 ^ and through - sin, - death;
85229 ^ also thus to all men - death passed,
85237 ^ for that all sinned.
85241 ^ until for
85243 ^ [the] law, sin was in [the] world;
85248 ^ sin however not is imputed,
85252 ^ not there being law.
85255 ^ nevertheless reigned - death from adam until moses, even
85264 ^ over those not having sinned in the likeness of the transgression of adam,
85274 ^ who is a type
85277 ^ of the coming [one].
85279 ^ but [is] not like the trespass
85284 ^ so also the gift.
85288 ^ if for by the of the one trespass, the many died,
85297 ^ how much more the grace - of god and the gift in grace which [is] of the one man, jesus christ, to the many did abound!
85318 ^ and [is] not
85320 ^ as through one having sinned, the gift.
85326 ^ the truly for
85329 ^ judgment [was], of one [was] unto condemnation;
85334 ^ - but
85336 ^ the gift [is] out of many trespasses, unto justification.
85342 ^ if for, by the of the one trespass, - death reigned through the one,
85354 ^ how much more
85356 ^ those the abundance - of grace, and of the gift - of righteousness
85366 ^ receiving, in life will reign through the one, jesus christ!
85375 ^ so then, just as by one trespass, to all men [it is] unto condemnation,
85386 ^ so also by one act of righteousness, to all men [it is] unto justification of life.
85397 ^ for as for through the disobedience of the one man, sinners were made the many,
85409 ^ so also through the obedience of the one, righteous will be made the many.
85420 ^ [the] law now entered,
85423 ^ so that might abound the trespass;
85427 ^ where however abounded - sin, overabounded - grace,
85435 ^ so that just as reigned the sin in - death,
85443 ^ so also - grace might reign through righteousness, unto life eternal, through jesus christ the lord of us.
85459 ^ what then will we say?
85462 ^ shall we continue - in sin,
85465 ^ that - grace may abound?
85469 ^ never may it be!
85720 ^ having been set free now from - sin, you have become slaves - to righteousness.
85728 ^ in human terms i speak on account of the weakness of the flesh of you.
85736 ^ for as for you yielded the members of you in bondage - to impurity and to lawlessness unto - lawlessness,
85751 ^ so now yield the members of you in bondage - to righteousness unto sanctification.
85762 ^ when for slaves you were
85766 ^ - of sin,
85768 ^ free you were
85770 ^ - from righteousness.
85772 ^ what therefore
85774 ^ fruit had you then
85777 ^ in the [things] of which now you are ashamed?
85781 ^ the for
85783 ^ end of those things [is] death.
85786 ^ now however,
85788 ^ having been set free from - sin,
85792 ^ having become slaves now - to god, you have the fruit of you unto sanctification;
85802 ^ - now
85804 ^ the end [is] life eternal.
85807 ^ the for
85809 ^ wages - of sin [is] death;
85813 ^ - but
85815 ^ the gift - of god, life eternal in christ jesus the lord of us.
85826 ^ or are you ignorant, brothers —
85992 ^ an occasion however having taken - sin by the commandment, it produced in me all covetousness;
86005 ^ apart from for
86007 ^ [the] law, sin [is] dead.
86010 ^ i however was alive apart from law once;
86016 ^ having come however the commandment,
86020 ^ the sin revived;
86023 ^ i then died.
86026 ^ and proved to be me the commandment that [was] to life, this to death.
86037 ^ the for
86039 ^ sin,
86040 ^ an occasion having taken by the commandment, deceived me,
86047 ^ and by it put [me] to death.
86051 ^ so - indeed
86054 ^ the law [is] holy,
86056 ^ and the commandment [is] holy and righteous and good.

86066 ^ [is] good, to me has become death?
86070 ^ never may it be!

86075 ^ in order that it might be shown to be sin,
86078 ^ through that which [is] good to me is working out death;
86084 ^ so that might become beyond excess sinful, - sin through the commandment.

88707 ^ if not by god;
91651 ^ being reviled, we bless;
91653 ^ being persecuted, we endure;
91655 ^ being slandered, we entreat.
91657 ^ as [the] scum of the earth we have become, of all [the] refuse, until now.
91666 ^ not
91667 ^ shaming you do i write these things,
91671 ^ but as children my beloved, admonishing [you].
91677 ^ if for ten thousand guardians you should have in christ,
91684 ^ yet not many fathers;
91688 ^ in for
91690 ^ christ jesus, through the gospel, i you have begotten.
91698 ^ i exhort therefore you,
91701 ^ imitators of me become.
91704 ^ on account of this i sent to you timothy,
91709 ^ who is my child, beloved and faithful in [the] lord,
91718 ^ who you will remind of the ways of me that [are] in christ jesus,
91728 ^ as everywhere in every church i teach.
91734 ^ as to not
91736 ^ coming now of me to you,
91741 ^ have become puffed up some.
91743 ^ i will come however shortly to you,
91748 ^ if the lord wills,
91752 ^ and i will find out not the talk
91757 ^ of those being puffed up,
91759 ^ but the power.
91762 ^ not for
91764 ^ in word the kingdom - of god [is],
91770 ^ but in power.
91773 ^ what desire you?
91775 ^ with a rod i should come to you,
91780 ^ or in love, a spirit then of gentleness?
91786 ^ actually is reported among you sexual immorality,
91791 ^ and such sexual immorality
91794 ^ as not even among the pagans,
91799 ^ so as for [the] wife one
91802 ^ of the father to have.
91805 ^ and you
91807 ^ puffed up are,
91809 ^ and not rather have mourned,
91813 ^ so that might be taken out of midst of you
91818 ^ the [one] the deed this
91822 ^ having done!
91823 ^ i
91824 ^ indeed, though
91826 ^ being absent - in body,
91829 ^ being present now - in spirit, already have judged
91835 ^ as being present
91837 ^ the [one] so this
91840 ^ having produced,
91841 ^ in the name of the lord our jesus having been gathered together you, and - of me in spirit, with the power of the lord of us jesus,
91861 ^ to deliver - such a one - to satan for destruction of the flesh,
91870 ^ so that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord.
91879 ^ not good [is] the boasting of you.
91884 ^ not know you
91886 ^ that a little leaven all the lump leavens?
91893 ^ cleanse out the old leaven,
91897 ^ that you may be a new lump,
91901 ^ as you are, unleavened.
91904 ^ also for the passover lamb of us has been sacrificed,
91910 ^ christ,
91911 ^ so that we might celebrate the feast, not with leaven old,
91917 ^ not with leaven of malice and wickedness,
91923 ^ but with unleavened [bread] of sincerity and of truth.
91929 ^ i wrote to you in the letter
91934 ^ not to associate with the sexually immoral,
91937 ^ not altogether with the sexually immoral the world of this, or with the covetous and swindlers, or idolaters —
91951 ^ since you would need then
91954 ^ from the world to depart.
91958 ^ now however, i wrote to you
91962 ^ not to associate with [him]
91964 ^ if anyone a brother
91967 ^ being designated, he is sexually immoral or a coveter, or an idolater or verbal abuser, or a drunkard, or swindler —
91980 ^ with such a one not even to eat.
91984 ^ what for [is it] to me
91987 ^ those outside to judge?
91990 ^ not those within you do judge?
91995 ^ those however
91997 ^ outside - god will judge.
92001 ^ expel the evil out from yourselves that.”
92007 ^ dare anyone of you,
92010 ^ a matter having against the other,
92015 ^ go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?
92024 ^ or not know you
92027 ^ that the saints the world will judge?
92033 ^ and if by you is to be judged the world,
92040 ^ unworthy are you
92042 ^ of cases of the smallest?
92044 ^ not know you
92046 ^ that angels we will judge?
92049 ^ how much more the things of this life?
92051 ^ the things of this life indeed so,
92054 ^ judgment [as to] if you have,
92250 ^ having taken then the members of the christ, shall i make [them] of a prostitute members?
92259 ^ never may it be!
92261 ^ or not know you
92264 ^ that
92265 ^ the [one] being joined to the prostitute, one body is?
92272 ^ will become,”
92273 ^ for it says,
92275 ^ the two into flesh one.”
92644 ^ having been circumcised anyone was called?
92647 ^ not let him be uncircumcised.
92649 ^ in uncircumcision was called anyone?
92653 ^ not let him be circumcised.
92655 ^ - circumcision nothing is,
92659 ^ and - uncircumcision nothing is,
92664 ^ but keeping [the] commandments of god.
92668 ^ each in the calling
92672 ^ in which he has been called,
92674 ^ in this let him abide.
92677 ^ slave [being] were you called,
92679 ^ not to you let it be a care;
92682 ^ but if also you are able
92686 ^ free to become,
92688 ^ rather take advantage.
92690 ^ the [one] for
93564 ^ free for being from all, to all myself i became servant,
93572 ^ so that the more i might gain.
93576 ^ and i became to the jews, like a jew,
93582 ^ so that jews i might win.
93585 ^ to those under [the] law, as under [the] law
93591 ^ not being myself under [the] law
93596 ^ so that those under [the] law i might win.
93601 ^ to those outside [the] law, like outside [the] law —
93605 ^ not being outside [the] law of god,
93609 ^ but under [the] law to christ —
93612 ^ so that i might win those outside [the] law.
93616 ^ i became to the weak, weak,
93620 ^ that the weak i might win.
93624 ^ these things to all i have become all,
93628 ^ so that by all means, some i might save.
93632 ^ all [things] now i do on account of the gospel,
93638 ^ that a fellow partaker with it i might become.
93642 ^ not know you
93644 ^ that
93645 ^ those in a race course
93648 ^ running, all indeed run;
93652 ^ one however receives the prize?
93657 ^ thus run,
93659 ^ that you might obtain [it].
94400 ^ in this now instructing, not i do praise ,
94405 ^ because not for the better, but for the worse, you come together.
94415 ^ first indeed, for
94418 ^ coming together you in an assembly, i hear
94423 ^ divisions among you there to be,
94427 ^ and in part it i believe.
94431 ^ it behooves for
94433 ^ also factions among you there to be,
94438 ^ so that also the approved, evident should become among you.
94446 ^ coming therefore of you together in one place,
94452 ^ not it is
94454 ^ [the] lord’s supper to eat.
94457 ^ one for the own supper takes first
94463 ^ in - eating;
94466 ^ and this [one] indeed is hungry,
94470 ^ that [one] however is drunken.
94473 ^ no indeed houses not have you
94478 ^ in which to eat
94481 ^ and to drink?
94483 ^ or the church - of god do you despise
94489 ^ and put to shame
94491 ^ those nothing
94493 ^ having?
94494 ^ what shall i say to you?
94497 ^ shall i praise you in this?
94501 ^ not i praise [you]!
94503 ^ i for received from the lord
94509 ^ that which also i delivered to you,
94513 ^ that the lord jesus in the night
94520 ^ in which he was betrayed, took bread,
94524 ^ and
94525 ^ having given thanks, he broke [it]
94527 ^ and said,
94529 ^ this of me is
94532 ^ the body, which [is] for you;
94537 ^ this do in - of me remembrance.
94543 ^ likewise also the cup,
94547 ^ after - having supped,
94550 ^ saying,
94551 ^ this - cup the new covenant is
94558 ^ in - my blood;
94562 ^ this do,
94564 ^ as often as if you might drink [it], in - of me remembrance.
94571 ^ as often as for if you may eat the bread this,
94578 ^ and the cup may drink,
94582 ^ the death of the lord you proclaim
94587 ^ until that he should come.
94590 ^ therefore
94591 ^ whoever - should eat the bread
94596 ^ or should drink the cup of the lord unworthily, guilty will be
94605 ^ of the body and of the blood of the lord.
94612 ^ let examine however a man himself,
94616 ^ and in this manner of the bread let him eat,
94622 ^ and of the cup let him drink.
94627 ^ the [one] for
94629 ^ eating
94630 ^ and drinking judgment on himself, eats
94635 ^ and drinks
94637 ^ not discerning the body.
94641 ^ because of this, among you many [are] weak and sick,
94649 ^ and are fallen asleep many.
94652 ^ if for ourselves we were judging,
94656 ^ not - we would come under judgment.
94659 ^ being judged however by the lord, we are disciplined,
94665 ^ so that not with the world we should be condemned.
94671 ^ so then, brothers of me,
94674 ^ coming together
94675 ^ in order - to eat, one another wait for.
94680 ^ if anyone is hungry,
94683 ^ at home let him eat,
94686 ^ so that not for judgment you might come together.
94691 ^ - and
94693 ^ the other things,
94694 ^ as soon as - i might come, i will set in order.
94698 ^ concerning now - spiritual [gifts], brothers, not i do want you
94706 ^ to be ignorant.
94707 ^ you know
94708 ^ that when pagans
94711 ^ you were,
94712 ^ to - idols - mute,
94717 ^ even as - you were led, being carried away.
94721 ^ therefore i make known to you
94724 ^ that no one
94726 ^ in [the] spirit of god speaking, says
94731 ^ accursed [is] jesus,
94733 ^ and no one is able
94736 ^ to say,
94737 ^ lord [is] jesus,
94739 ^ if not in [the] spirit holy.
94744 ^ varieties now
94746 ^ of gifts there are,
94748 ^ - but
94750 ^ the same spirit;
94752 ^ and varieties of services there are,
94756 ^ but the same lord;
94760 ^ and varieties of workings there are,
94764 ^ the but
94766 ^ same god
94768 ^ - is working the all things in everyone.
94774 ^ to each now is given the manifestation of the spirit for the common profiting.
94784 ^ to one truly for through the spirit is given a word of wisdom,
94793 ^ to another now a word of knowledge, according to the same spirit,
94801 ^ and to a different one, faith by the same spirit,
94807 ^ to another now gifts of healing in that one spirit,
94815 ^ to another now working of miracles,
94819 ^ to another now prophecy,
94822 ^ to another now distinguishing of spirits,
94826 ^ and to a different one various kinds of tongues,
94829 ^ to another now interpretation of tongues.
94833 ^ all now
94835 ^ these things works the one and the same spirit,
94843 ^ apportioning individually to each
94846 ^ as he wills.
94848 ^ just as for the body one is,
94854 ^ and members many has,
94858 ^ all now
94860 ^ the members of the body,
94864 ^ many being, one are
94868 ^ body;
94869 ^ so also [is] - christ.
94873 ^ also for in one spirit, we all into one body were baptized,
94884 ^ whether jews or greeks, whether slaves or free;
94892 ^ and all one spirit we were made to drink.
94897 ^ also for the body not is one member,
94905 ^ but many.
94907 ^ if should say the foot,
94911 ^ because not i am a hand,
94915 ^ not i am of the body,
94920 ^ not on account of this, not is it of the body.
94928 ^ and if should say the ear,
94933 ^ because not i am an eye,
94937 ^ not i am of the body,
94942 ^ not on account of this, not is it of the body.
94950 ^ if all the body [were] an eye,
94955 ^ where [would be] the hearing?
94958 ^ if all [were] hearing,
94961 ^ where [would be] the sense of smell?
94964 ^ now however, - god has arranged the members, one each of them in the body,
94977 ^ as he desired.
94979 ^ if now were - all one member,
94986 ^ where [would be] the body?
94989 ^ now however, many even [are the] members,
94994 ^ one however body.
94997 ^ not is able now the eye
95002 ^ to say to the hand,
95005 ^ need of you not i have.
95009 ^ or again the head
95013 ^ to the feet,
95015 ^ need of you not i have.
95019 ^ but much rather, those seeming members of the body
95027 ^ weaker to be, indispensable are;
95031 ^ and
95032 ^ those which we think less honorable to be
95036 ^ of the body,
95038 ^ these honor more abundant we bestow;
95042 ^ and the unpresentable [parts] of us, decorum more abundant have;
95049 ^ - and
95051 ^ the presentable [parts] of us, no need have.
95056 ^ but - god has composed the body,
97481 ^ thus therefore purposing, not then - lightness did i use?
97489 ^ or
97490 ^ what i purpose, according to flesh do i purpose,
97495 ^ so that there should be with me - yes, yes, and - no, no?
97506 ^ faithful however - god [is],
97510 ^ that the word of us - to you not was yes” and no.”
97522 ^ the - of god for
97526 ^ son, jesus, christ
97529 ^ the [one] among you by us
97534 ^ having been proclaimed
97535 ^ by me and silvanus and timothy, not was yes and no,
97546 ^ but yes in him it has always been.
97551 ^ as many as for
97553 ^ promises of god [there are], in him [is] the yes.
97559 ^ therefore also in him the amen - to god [is] for glory by us.
97571 ^ the [one] now
97573 ^ establishing us with you unto christ,
97579 ^ and having anointed us, [is] god,
97583 ^ the [one] also
97585 ^ having sealed us,
97587 ^ and having given the pledge of the spirit in the hearts of us.
97597 ^ i however, as witness - god call
97603 ^ upon - my soul,
97607 ^ that
97608 ^ sparing you, not yet have i come to corinth.
97614 ^ not that we lord it over your - faith,
97620 ^ but fellow workers are
97623 ^ of the joy with you;
97626 ^ in the for
97628 ^ faith you stand firm.
97630 ^ i judged for within myself this,
97634 ^ - not again in grief to you
97641 ^ to come.
97642 ^ if for i grieve you
97647 ^ again, who
97649 ^ - is gladdening me,
97652 ^ if not
97654 ^ the [one] being grieved by me?
97658 ^ and i wrote this same thing,
97662 ^ so that not,
97664 ^ having come, grief i might have
97667 ^ from [those] of whom it behooves
97670 ^ me to rejoice,
97672 ^ trusting in all you,
97676 ^ that - my joy of all of you is.
97683 ^ out of for
97685 ^ much affliction and anguish of heart i wrote to you through many tears,
97695 ^ not that you might be grieved,
97698 ^ but the love that you might know
97703 ^ that i have more abundantly toward you.
97708 ^ if however anyone has caused grief,
97712 ^ not me has he grieved,
97715 ^ but in part —
97718 ^ that not i might put it too severely — all you.
97723 ^ sufficient to such a one [is] the punishment this, which [is] by the majority,
97733 ^ so that on the contrary rather for you to forgive
97738 ^ and to comfort [him],
97740 ^ lest perhaps - by more abundant sorrow should be overwhelmed - such a one.
97748 ^ therefore i exhort you
97751 ^ to confirm toward him love.
97755 ^ for this indeed also did i write,
97760 ^ so that i might know the proof of you,
97765 ^ whether to everything obedient you are.
97770 ^ to whomever now anything you forgive,
97774 ^ i also ;
97775 ^ and for i, to whom i have forgiven,
97780 ^ if anything i have forgiven,
97783 ^ [it is] for the sake of you in [the] person of christ,
97788 ^ so that not we should be outwitted by - satan;
97794 ^ not for of his - schemes we are ignorant.
97800 ^ having come now to - troas for the gospel - of christ,
97810 ^ also a door to me having been opened in [the] lord, not i had rest in the spirit of me,
97822 ^ in the not
97824 ^ finding my titus the brother of me;
97830 ^ instead,
97831 ^ having taken leave of them, i went out to macedonia.
97836 ^ to however
97838 ^ god [be] thanks,
97840 ^ the [one] always
97842 ^ leading in triumph us in - christ,
97847 ^ and the fragrance of the knowledge of him making manifest through us in every place.
97859 ^ for of christ a sweet perfume we are - to god
97865 ^ in those being saved
97868 ^ and in those perishing;
97872 ^ to one indeed an odor from death to death,
97879 ^ to one now, a fragrance from life to life.
97886 ^ and for these things who [is] sufficient?
97891 ^ not for we are, like the many,
97897 ^ peddling the word - of god;
97902 ^ but as of sincerity, but as of god, before god in christ we speak.
97915 ^ are we beginning
97916 ^ again ourselves to commend?
97919 ^ or not we need, like some, commendatory letters to you or from you?
97931 ^ the letter of us you are,
97936 ^ having been inscribed in the hearts of us,
97941 ^ being known
97942 ^ and being read by all men,
97947 ^ being revealed
97948 ^ that you are a letter of christ,
97952 ^ having been ministered to by us,
97955 ^ having been inscribed not in ink but with [the] spirit of god
97961 ^ [the] living, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of hearts human.
97971 ^ confidence now
97973 ^ such we have through - christ toward - god.
97981 ^ not that from ourselves sufficient we are
98101 ^ having therefore such hope, great boldness we use,
98108 ^ and not as moses would put a veil over the face of himself,
98118 ^ for - not
98121 ^ to look intently the sons of israel into the end
98128 ^ of that fading away.
98130 ^ but were hardened the minds of them.
98135 ^ until for
98137 ^ the present day, the same veil at the reading of the old covenant remains,
98150 ^ not being lifted,
98152 ^ which in christ is being removed.
98156 ^ but unto this day, when - shall be read moses,
98163 ^ a veil over the heart of them lies.
98169 ^ whenever however if [one] shall have turned to [the] lord,
98175 ^ is taken away the veil.
98178 ^ the now
98180 ^ lord the spirit is;
98184 ^ where now the spirit of [the] lord [is], [there is] freedom.
98190 ^ we now
98192 ^ all,
98193 ^ having been unveiled in face, the glory of [the] lord beholding as in a mirror, the same image are being transformed into, from glory to glory, even as from [the] lord, [the] spirit.
98211 ^ because of this,
98213 ^ having the ministry this,
98217 ^ as we received mercy, not we lose heart.
98221 ^ but we have renounced the hidden things - of shame,
98227 ^ not walking in craftiness
98231 ^ nor falsifying the word - of god,
98237 ^ but - by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before - god.
98251 ^ if however indeed is
98255 ^ concealed the gospel of us,
98259 ^ to those who are perishing it is
98263 ^ concealed,
98264 ^ in whom the god of the age this has blinded the minds of the unbelieving,
98276 ^ so as for - not
98279 ^ to beam forth the illumination of the gospel of the glory - of christ,
98288 ^ who is [the] image - of god.
98293 ^ not for ourselves do we proclaim,
98297 ^ but jesus christ lord;
98301 ^ ourselves now,
98303 ^ servants of you, for the sake of jesus.
98307 ^ for [it is] - god,
98310 ^ - having said,
98312 ^ out of darkness light shall shine,”
98316 ^ who shone in the hearts of us for [the] radiance of the knowledge of the glory - of god in [the] face of jesus christ.
98334 ^ we have now the treasure this in earthen vessels,
98342 ^ that the surpassingness of the power may be - from god,
98350 ^ and not from us,
98354 ^ in every [way] being hard pressed,
98357 ^ but not being crushed;
98360 ^ being perplexed,
98361 ^ but not despairing;
98364 ^ being persecuted,
98365 ^ but not being forsaken;
98368 ^ being struck down,
98369 ^ but not being destroyed;
98372 ^ always the death - [of] jesus in [our] body carrying around,
98381 ^ so that also the life - of jesus in the body of us should be manifested;
98392 ^ always for we
98395 ^ the living to death are being delivered on account of jesus,
98402 ^ so that also the life - of jesus may be manifested in the mortal flesh of us.
98414 ^ so then, - death in us works,
98420 ^ - but
98422 ^ life in you.
98425 ^ having however the same spirit - of faith,
98432 ^ according to that having been written:
98435 ^ i believed,
98436 ^ therefore i have spoken,” also we believe,
98441 ^ therefore also speak,
98444 ^ knowing
98445 ^ that
98446 ^ the [one] having raised up the lord jesus, also us through jesus will raise up
98456 ^ and will present [us] with you.
98460 ^ - for
98462 ^ all things [are] for the sake of you,
98465 ^ so that the grace
98468 ^ having abounded through - more and more the thanksgiving may increase to the glory - of god.
98480 ^ therefore not we lose heart;
98483 ^ but if indeed the outward of us man is being brought to decay,
98491 ^ yet the inner of us is being renewed day and day.
98499 ^ the for
98501 ^ momentary lightness - affliction of us, far surpassing to excessiveness an eternal weight of glory is producing for us,
98515 ^ not are looking at we
98518 ^ the things being seen,
98520 ^ but
98521 ^ the things not
98523 ^ being seen.
98682 ^ knowing therefore the fear of the lord, men we persuade
98690 ^ to god and we have been made manifest;
98693 ^ i hope now also
98696 ^ in the consciences of you to have been made manifest.
98701 ^ not again ourselves are we commending to you,
98706 ^ but
98707 ^ occasion are giving to you
98710 ^ of boasting on behalf of us,
98713 ^ so that you may have [an answer]
98715 ^ toward those in appearance
98719 ^ boasting,
98720 ^ and not in [the] heart.
98724 ^ if for we are beside ourselves,
98727 ^ [it is] to god;
98728 ^ or if we are sober-minded
98730 ^ [it is] for you.
98731 ^ the for
98733 ^ love - of christ compels us,
98738 ^ having concluded this,
98740 ^ that one for all has died,
98745 ^ therefore - all have died.
98749 ^ and for all he died,
98753 ^ that
98754 ^ those living, no longer to themselves should live,
98759 ^ but
98760 ^ to the [one] for them
98763 ^ having died
98764 ^ and having been raised again.
98766 ^ therefore we from - now no one regard according to [the] flesh.
98775 ^ though even we have regarded according to flesh christ,
98781 ^ yet now no longer we regard [him thus].
98785 ^ therefore if anyone [is] in christ,
98790 ^ [he is] a new creation.
98792 ^ the old things have passed away;
98795 ^ behold,
98796 ^ has come into being [the] new.
98798 ^ - and
98800 ^ all things [are] of - god,
98804 ^ the [one] having reconciled us to himself through christ,
98810 ^ and having given to us the ministry - of reconciliation,
98817 ^ how that god was
98821 ^ in christ [the] world reconciling to himself,
98826 ^ not reckoning to them the trespasses of them,
98832 ^ and having put into us the word - of reconciliation.
98840 ^ for christ therefore we are ambassadors,
98844 ^ as though - god
98847 ^ is beseeching through us.
98850 ^ we implore on behalf of christ:
98853 ^ be reconciled - to god.
98871 ^ working together now also we exhort
98875 ^ not in vain the grace - of god to receive you.
98884 ^ he says for:
98886 ^ in a time acceptable i listened to you,
98890 ^ and in a day of salvation i helped you.”
98896 ^ behold,
98897 ^ now [is the] time of favor;
98900 ^ behold,
98901 ^ now [is the] day of salvation.
98984 ^ as being unknown,
98986 ^ and yet
98987 ^ being well-known;
98988 ^ as dying,
98990 ^ and yet behold,
98992 ^ we live;
98993 ^ as being disciplined,
98995 ^ and yet
98996 ^ not being killed;
98998 ^ as being sorrowful,
99000 ^ always yet
99002 ^ rejoicing;
99003 ^ as poor,
99008 ^ as nothing
99010 ^ having,
99011 ^ and yet
99012 ^ all things possessing.
99014 ^ the mouth of us has been opened to you, corinthians;
99021 ^ the heart of us has been expanded.
99025 ^ not you are restrained by us;
99029 ^ you are restrained however in the affections of you.
99035 ^ - now
99037 ^ [as] the same recompense,
99039 ^ as to children i speak,
99042 ^ be expanded also you.
99045 ^ not become
99047 ^ unequally yoked together with unbelievers;
99049 ^ what for partnership [have] righteousness and lawlessness?
99055 ^ or what fellowship light with darkness?
99061 ^ what now harmony christ with belial?
99067 ^ or what part to a believer with an unbeliever?
99073 ^ what now agreement [the] temple of god with idols?
99080 ^ we for [the] temple of god are,
99085 ^ [the] living,
99086 ^ as has said - god
99090 ^ -: i will dwell in them,
99094 ^ and will walk among [them];
99096 ^ and i will be their god,
99100 ^ and they will be to me a people.”
99105 ^ therefore come out from the midst of them
99110 ^ and be separate,
99112 ^ says [the] lord,
99114 ^ and unclean nothing touch,
99118 ^ and i will receive you.”
99121 ^ and i will be to you for a father,
99126 ^ and you will be to me for sons and daughters,
99134 ^ says [the] lord almighty.
99137 ^ these therefore having
99140 ^ - promises, beloved, we should cleanse ourselves from every defilement of flesh and spirit,
99151 ^ perfecting holiness in [the] fear of god.
99156 ^ make room for us;
99158 ^ no one we have wronged,
99160 ^ no one we have corrupted,
99162 ^ no one we have exploited.
99164 ^ for condemnation not i speak;
99168 ^ i have before said for
99170 ^ that in the hearts of us you are,
99176 ^ for [us] - to die together,
99179 ^ and to live together.
99181 ^ great [is] my boldness toward you;
99186 ^ great my boasting on behalf of you;
99191 ^ i have been filled - with encouragement;
99194 ^ i overabound - with joy upon all the affliction of us.
99202 ^ and for having come of us into macedonia,
99208 ^ no had
99210 ^ rest the flesh of us;
99214 ^ but
99215 ^ in every [way] we are being pressed:
99218 ^ on the outside conflicts,
99220 ^ within fears.
99222 ^ but
99744 ^ very earnest however being, of his own accord he has gone out to you.
99751 ^ we have sent now with him the brother
99757 ^ whose - praise [is] in the gospel through all of the churches;
99767 ^ not only now,
99770 ^ but also
99772 ^ having been chosen by the churches fellow traveler of us, with - grace this
99782 ^ that [is] being administered by us toward the himself of the lord glory, and readiness of us,
99795 ^ avoiding this, lest anyone us should blame in the abundance this
99805 ^ - being administered by us.
99809 ^ we are taking great care to do for what is right, not only
99814 ^ before [the] lord, but also before men.
99820 ^ we sent with now them the brother of us,
99826 ^ whom we have proven in many things often
99831 ^ earnest to be,
99833 ^ now however much earnest by [his] confidence more which [is] in you.
99842 ^ whether as regards titus,
99845 ^ [he is] partner my and for you a fellow worker;
99851 ^ or brothers our,
99854 ^ [they are] apostles of [the] churches, [the] glory of christ.
100180 ^ being absent however am bold toward you.
100185 ^ i implore [you] now
100187 ^ that, not
100189 ^ being present,
100190 ^ to be bold with the confidence
100193 ^ with which i reckon
100195 ^ to be daring
100196 ^ toward some - reckoning us
100201 ^ as according to flesh
100204 ^ walking.
100205 ^ in flesh for walking, not according to flesh do we wage war.
100213 ^ the for
100215 ^ weapons of the warfare of us [are] not fleshly,
100221 ^ but powerful - divinely to [the] demolition of strongholds,
100818 ^ as being beside myself i speak
100820 ^ above [measure]: i [too],
100822 ^ in labors more abundantly,
100825 ^ in imprisonments more abundantly,
100828 ^ in beatings above measure,
100831 ^ in deaths often.
100834 ^ from [the] jews five times forty [lashes] minus one i received.
100841 ^ three times i was beaten with rods,
100843 ^ once i was stoned,
100845 ^ three times i was shipwrecked,
100847 ^ a night and a day in the deep [sea] i have passed;
100852 ^ in journeyings often,
100854 ^ in perils of rivers, in perils of robbers; in perils from [my own] race, in perils from [the] gentiles; in perils in [the] city, in perils in [the] wilderness; in perils on [the] sea, in perils among false brothers;
100876 ^ in labor and toil,
100879 ^ in watchings often;
100882 ^ in hunger and thirst,
100886 ^ in fastings often;
100889 ^ in cold and nakedness.
100893 ^ besides the things external, the pressure on me - on every day [is my] care for all the churches.
100907 ^ who is weak,
100909 ^ and not i am weak?
100912 ^ who is led into sin,
100914 ^ and not i do burn inwardly?
100918 ^ if
100919 ^ to boast it behooves [me],
100921 ^ [in] the things of the weakness of me i will boast.
100926 ^ the god and father of the lord jesus knows,
100934 ^ the [one] being blessed to the ages,
100940 ^ that not i am lying.
100943 ^ in damascus the governor under aretas the king was guarding the city of the damascenes
100954 ^ to seize me.
100956 ^ but through a window in a basket i was let down through the wall,
100965 ^ and i escaped the hands of him.
101960 ^ only however hearing they were
101964 ^ that
101965 ^ the [one] persecuting us formerly, now is preaching the faith
101973 ^ which once he was destroying.
101976 ^ and they were glorifying in me - god.
101982 ^ then after fourteen years again i went up to jerusalem with barnabas,
101992 ^ having taken with [me] also titus.
101995 ^ i went up now according to a revelation
101999 ^ and set before them the gospel
102004 ^ that i proclaim among the gentiles —
102009 ^ apart individually however
102012 ^ to those esteemed —
102014 ^ lest hardly in vain i should be running
102019 ^ or have run.
102021 ^ but not even titus who [was] with me,
102027 ^ a greek being, was compelled
102030 ^ to be circumcised,
102031 ^ because of even
102033 ^ the brought in secretly false brothers,
102036 ^ who came in by stealth
102038 ^ to spy out the freedom of us
102042 ^ which we have in christ jesus,
102047 ^ that us they will enslave,
102050 ^ to whom not even for an hour did we yield - in subjection,
102057 ^ so that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.
102065 ^ of now
102067 ^ those esteemed
102069 ^ to be something —
102172 ^ before - for,
102175 ^ came certain ones from james, with the gentiles he was eating;
102183 ^ when however they came,
102186 ^ he was drawing back
102187 ^ and was separating himself,
102190 ^ being afraid of those of [the] circumcision.
102194 ^ and acted hypocritically with him also the rest of [the] jews,
102201 ^ so that even barnabas was carried away of them by the hypocrisy.
102208 ^ but when i saw
102211 ^ that not they are walking uprightly according to the truth of the gospel,
102219 ^ i said - to peter before all,
102224 ^ if you,
102226 ^ a jew being, like a gentile and not like a jew live,
102233 ^ why
102234 ^ the gentiles do you compel to judaize?
102238 ^ we, by birth jews, and not of [the] gentiles sinners,
102246 ^ knowing nevertheless
102248 ^ that not is justified a man by works of law,
102255 ^ if not through faith from jesus; christ even we in christ jesus have believed,
102267 ^ that we may be justified by faith from christ,
102272 ^ and not by works of the law;
102277 ^ because by works of the law not will be justified any flesh.
102285 ^ if however
102287 ^ seeking
102288 ^ to be justified in christ, have been found also we ourselves sinners,
102295 ^ [is] then christ of sin a minister?
102299 ^ never may it be!
102301 ^ if for that i had torn down,
102305 ^ these things again i build,
102308 ^ a transgressor myself i prove.
102311 ^ i for, through [the] law to [the] law died,
102317 ^ that to god i might live.
102320 ^ christ i have been crucified with;
102322 ^ i live now, no longer i;
102326 ^ lives however in me christ;
102400 ^ having begun in [the] spirit, now in [the] flesh are you being perfected?
102405 ^ so many things did you suffer in vain,
102408 ^ if indeed also in vain?
102412 ^ the [one] therefore
102414 ^ supplying to you the spirit
102418 ^ and working miracles among you, [is it] out of works of the law or out of hearing of faith?
102430 ^ so also, abraham believed - god,
102435 ^ and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.”
102440 ^ know then
102442 ^ that those of faith,
102446 ^ these sons are
102449 ^ of abraham.
102450 ^ having foreseen then the scripture
102454 ^ that by faith justifies the gentiles - god, foretold the gospel - to abraham
102465 ^ -: will be blessed in you all the nations.”
102472 ^ so then, those of faith are blessed along with the believing abraham.
102735 ^ before - now came - faith, under the law we were held in custody,
102744 ^ having been locked up until the being about faith
102749 ^ to be revealed,
102750 ^ so that the law trainer of us has become, unto christ,
102758 ^ so that by faith we might be justified.
102762 ^ having come now - faith,
102766 ^ no longer under a trainer we are.
102770 ^ all for sons of god you are through - faith in christ jesus.
103030 ^ the eyes of you having gouged out, you would have given [them] to me.
103036 ^ so enemy of you have i become,
103040 ^ speaking truth to you?
103042 ^ they are zealous after you not rightly,
103046 ^ but
103047 ^ to exclude you [from us]. they desire
103050 ^ so that them you might be zealous after.
103053 ^ good [it is] now
103055 ^ to be zealous in a right [thing] at all times,
103059 ^ and not only
103062 ^ in - being present my with you.
103068 ^ children of me,
103070 ^ of whom again i travail
103073 ^ until that shall have been formed christ in you,
103079 ^ i was wishing indeed
103081 ^ to be present with you presently
103085 ^ and to change the tone of me,
103090 ^ because i am perplexed as to you.
103094 ^ tell me,
103096 ^ those
103097 ^ under [the] law
103099 ^ wishing
103100 ^ to be,
103101 ^ the law not you do listen to?
103105 ^ it has been written for
103107 ^ that abraham two sons had,
103112 ^ one of the slave woman and one of the free.
103121 ^ but the [one] indeed
103124 ^ of the slave woman, according to flesh has been born;
103130 ^ the [one] but
103132 ^ of the free, through [the] promise,
103137 ^ which things are
103139 ^ allegorized;
103140 ^ these for are two covenants:
103145 ^ one indeed from mount sinai,
104373 ^ - for by grace you are
104377 ^ saved through faith,
104380 ^ and this not of yourselves;
104385 ^ [it is] of god the gift,
104388 ^ not as a result of works,
104391 ^ so that not anyone may boast.
104395 ^ of him for we are
104398 ^ workmanship,
104399 ^ having been created in christ jesus for works good,
104406 ^ which prepared beforehand - god,
104410 ^ that in them we should walk.
104414 ^ therefore remember
104416 ^ that formerly you the gentiles in [the] flesh,
104423 ^ the ones being called [the] uncircumcision by that
104428 ^ being called [the] circumcision, in [the] flesh made by hands —
104433 ^ that you were at the time that separate from christ,
104440 ^ alienated from the commonwealth - of israel, and strangers to the covenants of the promise,
104451 ^ hope not having and without god in the world.
104459 ^ now however in christ jesus, you
104465 ^ the [ones] once being far off have become near by the blood - of christ.
104476 ^ he himself for is the peace of us,
104482 ^ - having made - both one,
104487 ^ and the barrier of the fence having broken down,
104493 ^ the hostility, in the flesh of him,
104499 ^ the law - of commandments in ordinances having annulled,
104506 ^ so that the two he might create in himself into one new man,
104516 ^ making peace;
104518 ^ and he might reconcile - both in one body - to god through the cross,
104530 ^ having slain the hostility by it.
104535 ^ and
104536 ^ having come, he proclaimed the gospel: peace to you, the [ones] far off,
104542 ^ and peace to those near.
104546 ^ for through him we have the access - both by one spirit to the father.
104560 ^ so then no longer are you strangers and aliens,
104567 ^ but are fellow citizens of the saints and of the household - of god,
104576 ^ having been built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
104584 ^ being [the] cornerstone himself christ jesus,
104589 ^ in whom the whole building,
104593 ^ being fitted together, is increasing into a temple, holy in [the] lord,
104600 ^ in whom also you are being built together for a habitation - of god in [the] spirit.
104611 ^ of this for reason, i paul, the prisoner - of christ jesus, for you - gentiles...
104624 ^ if indeed you have heard of the administration of the grace - of god,
104633 ^ - having been given to me toward you,
104638 ^ that by revelation he made known to me the mystery,
104645 ^ just as i have written before in brief,
104649 ^ by which you are able, reading [it],
104653 ^ to understand the insight of me into the mystery - of christ,
104662 ^ which in other generations not was made known to the sons - of men,
104671 ^ as now it has been revealed to holy apostles his and prophets in [the] spirit,
104682 ^ are the gentiles joint-heirs, and a joint-body, and joint-partakers of the promise in christ jesus, through the gospel,
104698 ^ of which i became
104700 ^ servant according to the gift of the grace - of god
104708 ^ -, having been given to me according to the working of the power of him.
104717 ^ to me, the very least of all saints, was given the grace this:
104726 ^ to the gentiles to preach the unsearchable riches - of christ,
104734 ^ and to enlighten all
104737 ^ what [is] the administration of the mystery
104742 ^ - having been hidden from the ages in - god,
104750 ^ the [one] - all things
104753 ^ having created,
104754 ^ so that should be made known now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly realms, through the church, the manifold wisdom - of god, according to [the] purpose of the ages,
104777 ^ which he accomplished in - christ jesus the lord of us,
104786 ^ in whom we have - boldness and access in confidence, by the faith from him.
104799 ^ therefore i implore [you]
104801 ^ not to lose heart at the tribulations of me for you,
104809 ^ which is glory of you.
104813 ^ ... of this for reason i bow the knees of me to the father,
104822 ^ from whom every family in [the] heavens and on earth is named,
104832 ^ that he might give you according to the riches of the glory of him,
104841 ^ with power, to be strengthened by the spirit of him
104847 ^ in the inner man, [for] to dwell - christ through - faith in the hearts of you,
104861 ^ in love being rooted
104864 ^ and being founded,
104866 ^ so that you may be fully able
104868 ^ to comprehend with all the saints
104873 ^ what [is] the breadth and length and height and depth,
104882 ^ to know then the
104885 ^ surpassing - knowledge love - of christ,
104891 ^ so that you may be filled unto all the fullness - of god.
105022 ^ having ascended on high, he led captive captivity,
105027 ^ [and] gave gifts - to men.”
105142 ^ speaking the truth however in love, we should grow up into him in all things
105151 ^ who is the head, christ,
105156 ^ from whom all the body,
105161 ^ being joined together
105162 ^ and being held together by every ligament of [its] supply, according to [the] working in [the] measure individual of each part, the increase of the body makes for itself to [the] building up of itself in love.
105186 ^ this therefore i say
105189 ^ and testify in [the] lord:
105193 ^ no longer [are] you to walk
105196 ^ as also the gentiles are walking, in [the] futility of the mind of them,
105206 ^ being darkened in the understanding,
105209 ^ being
105210 ^ alienated from the life - of god, because of the ignorance
105218 ^ - being in them, on account of the hardness of the heart of them,
105228 ^ who
105229 ^ having cast off all feeling, themselves have given up to sensuality, for [the] working of impurity, all with greediness.
105240 ^ you however not this way learned - christ,

108725 ^ no one you let disqualify,

109817 ^ to have imparted to you not only the gospel - of god, but also our
109828 ^ own lives,
109830 ^ because beloved to us you have become.
109834 ^ you remember for, brothers, the labor of us and - hardship:
109843 ^ night and day working,
109847 ^ in order - not
109850 ^ to burden anyone of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel - of god.
109860 ^ you [are] witnesses,
109862 ^ and - god,
109865 ^ how holily, and righteously, and blamelessly, toward you,
109872 ^ those believing, we were;
109875 ^ just as you know
109877 ^ how one each of you,
109881 ^ as a father children his own,
109885 ^ exhorting you
109887 ^ and comforting
109889 ^ and charging
109891 ^ unto - to walk you worthily - of god,
109898 ^ who calls you into the of himself kingdom and glory.
109907 ^ and because of this also, we give thanks - to god unceasingly
109916 ^ that,
109917 ^ having received [the] word [by your] hearing from us
109922 ^ - of god, you accepted not [the] word of men,
109928 ^ but even as it is, truly
109932 ^ [the] word of god,
109934 ^ which also works in you
109939 ^ who believe.
109941 ^ you for imitators became, brothers,
109946 ^ of the churches - of god
109950 ^ - being in - judea in christ jesus.
109958 ^ for the same as them, suffered also you from the own countrymen,
109968 ^ as also [did] they from the jews,
109974 ^ who both the lord
109978 ^ having killed,
109979 ^ jesus, and their own prophets,
109983 ^ and us having driven out,
109986 ^ and god not pleasing, and all men [who are] set against,
109994 ^ hindering
109995 ^ us to the gentiles to speak,
109999 ^ that they might be saved,
110001 ^ so as - to fill up their - sins always.
110008 ^ has come now upon them the wrath to the utmost.
110016 ^ we however, brothers,
110019 ^ having been bereaved of you for [the] time of an hour, in face, not in heart, more abundantly were eager
110030 ^ the face of you to see with great desire.
110037 ^ therefore we wanted
110039 ^ to come to you —
110042 ^ i indeed
110044 ^ paul, both once and twice —
110049 ^ and hindered us - satan.
110054 ^ who [is] for our hope, or joy, or crown of boasting?
110063 ^ or [are] not even you, before the lord of us jesus, at - his coming?
110076 ^ you for are the glory of us, and - joy.
110085 ^ therefore
110086 ^ no longer enduring, we thought it best
110089 ^ to be left behind in athens alone,
110093 ^ and we sent timothy, the brother of us and fellow worker - of god in the gospel - of christ,
110108 ^ in order - to strengthen you
110112 ^ and to encourage concerning the faith of you,
110118 ^ that no one
110120 ^ be moved in the tribulations these.
110125 ^ yourselves for you know
110128 ^ that for this we are destined.
110132 ^ and indeed, when with you we were,
110138 ^ we were telling beforehand you
110140 ^ that we are about
110142 ^ to suffer affliction,
110143 ^ just as also it came to pass,
110146 ^ and you know.
110148 ^ because of this i also,
110151 ^ no longer enduring, sent
110154 ^ in order - to know the faith of you,
110160 ^ lest somehow had tempted you
110164 ^ the [one] tempting,
110166 ^ and in vain would be the labor of us.
110173 ^ presently however, having come timothy to us from you,
110181 ^ and having brought good news to us of the faith and the love of you,
110190 ^ and that you have a remembrance of us good always,
110197 ^ longing
110198 ^ us to see,
110200 ^ just as also we you,
110204 ^ because of this we were encouraged, brothers, as to you, in all the distress and tribulation of us, through - your faith.
110221 ^ for now we live,
110224 ^ if you are standing firm in [the] lord.
111306 ^ for - to be revealed him in - his time.
111314 ^ the for
111316 ^ mystery already is working
111319 ^ - of lawlessness;
111321 ^ only [there is]
111322 ^ the [one] restraining [it] at present
111325 ^ until out of [the] midst he might be [gone].
111329 ^ and then will be revealed the lawless [one],
111334 ^ whom the lord jesus will slay with the breath of the mouth of him
111344 ^ and will annul by the appearing of the coming of him,
111351 ^ whose is
111353 ^ - coming, according to [the] working - of satan, in every power, and in signs, and in wonders of falsehood, and in every deceit of wickedness
111372 ^ unto those perishing,
111374 ^ in return for which the love of the truth not they received,
111382 ^ in order for - to be saved them.
111386 ^ and because of this, will send to them - god a working of delusion,
111395 ^ for - to believe them what [is] false,
111401 ^ in order that should be judged
111403 ^ all those not
111406 ^ having believed the truth, but
111410 ^ having delighted - in unrighteousness.
111413 ^ we however ought
111416 ^ to give thanks - to god always concerning you, brothers
111423 ^ beloved by [the] lord,
111426 ^ that has chosen you - god
111431 ^ from [the] beginning, unto salvation in [the] sanctification of [the] spirit, and [by] faith of [the] truth;
111440 ^ to this also he called you, through the gospel of us, to [the] obtaining of [the] glory of the lord of us jesus christ.
111457 ^ so then, brothers, stand firm
111461 ^ and hold fast to the traditions
111465 ^ that you were taught,
111467 ^ whether by word,
111470 ^ or by letter from us.
111474 ^ himself now
111476 ^ the lord of us jesus christ, and - god, the father of us,
111487 ^ the [one] having loved us
111490 ^ and having given [us] comfort eternal and hope good by grace, may he encourage your - hearts
111503 ^ and may he strengthen [them] in every work and word good.
111511 ^ - finally, pray, brothers, for us,
111517 ^ that the word of the lord may spread quickly
111523 ^ and may be glorified,
111525 ^ just as also with you,
111529 ^ and that we may be delivered from - perverse and evil men;
111538 ^ not for all [are] of the faith.
111543 ^ faithful however is the lord,
111548 ^ who will strengthen you
111551 ^ and will keep [you] from - evil.
111556 ^ we are persuaded now in [the] lord as to you,
111562 ^ that the things that we command,
111565 ^ both you are doing
111567 ^ and you will do.
111569 ^ - and
111571 ^ the lord may direct your - hearts into the love - of god and into the steadfastness - of christ.
111587 ^ we command now you, brothers, in [the] name of the lord of us jesus christ,
111598 ^ are to withdraw you from every brother
111603 ^ idly walking
111605 ^ and not according to the tradition
111610 ^ that you received from us.
111614 ^ yourselves for you know
111617 ^ how it behooves [you]
111619 ^ to imitate us,
111621 ^ because not we were idle among you,
111626 ^ nor without payment bread did we eat from anyone,
111632 ^ but in labor and hardship, night and day working,
111641 ^ in order - not
111644 ^ to be burdensome to any of you,
111647 ^ not that not we have [the] right,
111652 ^ but that ourselves [as] an example we may offer to you,
111658 ^ for - you to imitate us.
111662 ^ even for when we were with you,
111668 ^ this we were commanding you,
111671 ^ that if anyone not is willing
111676 ^ to work,
111677 ^ neither let him eat.
111679 ^ we hear for some
111682 ^ are walking among you idly,
111686 ^ not at all working,
111688 ^ but being busybodies.
111690 ^ to now
111692 ^ such, we warn
111694 ^ and exhort by our lord jesus christ,
111700 ^ so that,
111701 ^ with quietness working, - their own bread they may eat.
111708 ^ you now, brothers, not shall grow weary
111713 ^ [in] well-doing.
111714 ^ if then anyone not obey this instruction of us through the letter,
111725 ^ of this [man] take note
111727 ^ not to mix with him,
111730 ^ so that he may be ashamed.
111732 ^ and yet not as an enemy esteem [him],
111737 ^ but admonish [him] as a brother.
111741 ^ himself now
111743 ^ the lord - of peace may give you - peace through all, in every way.
111756 ^ the lord [be] with all of you.
111761 ^ the greeting - in my own hand — paul,
111767 ^ which is [my] sign in every letter.
111773 ^ in this manner i write.
111775 ^ the grace of the lord of us jesus christ [be] with all of you.
111785 ^ paul, an apostle of christ jesus according to [the] command of god [the] savior of us, and of christ jesus, the hope of us, to timothy, [my] true child in [the] faith:
111805 ^ grace, mercy, [and] peace from god [the] father, and christ jesus, the lord of us.
111817 ^ just as i urged you
111820 ^ to remain in ephesus,
111823 ^ [when] i was going to macedonia,
111826 ^ so that you might warn certain men
111829 ^ not to teach other doctrines,
111831 ^ nor to give heed to myths and genealogies endless,
111837 ^ which speculations bring,
111840 ^ rather than stewardship of god, which [is] in faith.
111847 ^ - and
111849 ^ the goal of [our] instruction is love out of a pure heart and a conscience good and a faith sincere,
111863 ^ from which some, having missed the mark, have turned aside to meaningless discourse,
111869 ^ desiring
111870 ^ to be teachers of the law,
111872 ^ not understanding
111874 ^ neither what they are saying,
111877 ^ nor [that] about which they confidently assert.
111881 ^ we know now
111883 ^ that good [is] the law,
111887 ^ if one it lawfully uses,
111892 ^ knowing this,
111894 ^ that for a righteous [one] law not is enacted,
111899 ^ for [the] lawless however,
111901 ^ and insubordinate, for [the] ungodly and sinful, for [the] unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for slayers of man, for the sexually immoral, homosexuals, enslavers, liars, perjurers,
111918 ^ and if anything other, in the being sound teaching, is opposed to, according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed god,
111934 ^ with which have been entrusted
111936 ^ i. thankfulness i have
111939 ^ for the [one] having strengthened me,
111942 ^ christ jesus the lord of us,
111947 ^ that faithful me he esteemed,
111951 ^ having appointed [me] to service,
111954 ^ - formerly being a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and insolent;
111962 ^ but i was shown mercy,
111964 ^ because
111965 ^ being ignorant, i did [it] in unbelief.
111969 ^ surpassingly increased then the grace of the lord of us, with [the] faith and love, that [are] in christ jesus.
111984 ^ trustworthy [is] the saying
111987 ^ and of full acceptance worthy,
111991 ^ that christ jesus came into the world
111998 ^ sinners to save,
112000 ^ of whom [the] foremost am i.
112004 ^ but because of this, i was shown mercy,
112008 ^ that in me, [the] foremost, might display christ jesus - perfect patience, as a pattern
112020 ^ for those being about
112022 ^ to believe on him, to life eternal.
112028 ^ to now
112030 ^ [the] king of the ages, [the] immortal, invisible, only god, [be] honor and glory, to the ages of the ages.
112045 ^ amen.
112046 ^ this - charge i commit to you, [my] child timothy, according to the
112055 ^ going before as to you prophecies,
112059 ^ that you might war by them the good warfare,
112066 ^ holding faith and a good conscience,
112071 ^ which some,
112073 ^ having cast away, concerning the faith have caused a shipwreck,
112078 ^ among whom are hymenaeus and alexander,
112083 ^ whom i have handed over - to satan
112087 ^ that they may be disciplined
112089 ^ not to blaspheme.
112091 ^ i exhort therefore, first of all,
112095 ^ to be made entreaties, prayers, intercessions, [and] thanksgivings, on behalf of all men, for kings and all
112107 ^ those in authority
112110 ^ being,
112111 ^ so that a tranquil and quiet life we may lead, in all godliness and dignity.
112122 ^ this [is] good and acceptable before the savior of us, god,
112131 ^ who
112132 ^ all men desires
112135 ^ to be saved,
112136 ^ and to [the] knowledge of [the] truth to come.
112141 ^ one for
112143 ^ god [there is],
112144 ^ one then
112146 ^ mediator between god and men, [the] man christ jesus,
112153 ^ the [one] having given himself [as] a ransom for all,
112159 ^ the testimony in proper times their own,
112163 ^ in regard to which was appointed i a herald and an apostle —
112170 ^ [the] truth i am speaking;
112172 ^ not i do lie —
112174 ^ a teacher of [the] gentiles, in faith and truth.
112180 ^ i desire therefore
112182 ^ to pray the men in every place,
112188 ^ lifting up holy hands, apart from anger and dissension.
112195 ^ likewise also
112197 ^ women, in apparel respectable, with modesty and self-control, should adorn themselves,
112207 ^ not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or clothing costly,
112217 ^ but
112218 ^ with what is becoming to women
112221 ^ professing [the] fear of god, through works good.
112226 ^ a woman in quietness let learn in all submissiveness.
112546 ^ these things laying before the brothers, good you will be
112552 ^ a servant of christ jesus,
112555 ^ being nourished in the words of the faith and of the good teaching
112564 ^ that you have closely followed.
112566 ^ - but
112568 ^ profane and silly fables refuse.
112573 ^ train rather yourself to godliness.
112578 ^ - for
112580 ^ bodily exercise of a little is profit,
112586 ^ - but
112588 ^ godliness for everything profitable is,
112593 ^ [the] promise holding
112595 ^ of life of the present,
112598 ^ and of the [one] coming.
112601 ^ trustworthy [is] the saying,
112604 ^ and of full acceptance worthy.
112608 ^ for this for we toil
112612 ^ and strive,
112614 ^ because we have hope on god
112618 ^ [the] living,
112619 ^ who is [the] savior of all men, especially of believers.
112626 ^ command these things
112628 ^ and teach.

115686 ^ son of me are you;
115690 ^ i today have begotten you?”
115694 ^ and again:
115696 ^ i will be to him for a father,
115701 ^ and he will be to me for a son?”
115707 ^ when then again he brings the firstborn into the world,
115716 ^ he says:
115717 ^ and let worship him all [the] angels of god.”
115723 ^ and as to indeed
115726 ^ the angels he says:
115729 ^ the [one] making the angels of him winds,
115735 ^ and the ministers of him, of fire a flame.”
115741 ^ unto however
115743 ^ the son:
115745 ^ the throne of you, o god, [is] to the age of the age,
115755 ^ and the scepter of righteousness [is] [the] scepter of the kingdom of you.
115764 ^ you have loved righteousness
115766 ^ and have hated wickedness;
115769 ^ because of this, has anointed you - god, the god of you, with [the] oil of exultation, above the companions of you.”
115784 ^ and: you in [the] beginning, lord, of the earth laid the foundation,
115792 ^ and works of the hands of you are the heavens.
115800 ^ they will perish;
115802 ^ you however remain;
115805 ^ and all like a garment will grow old;
115810 ^ and like a robe you will roll up them,
115815 ^ like a garment also they will be changed;
115819 ^ you however the same are,
115824 ^ and the years of you not will never end.”
115830 ^ to which now
115833 ^ of the angels did he say ever:
115837 ^ sit at [the] right hand of me,
115841 ^ until - i may place the enemies of you [as] a footstool for the feet of you”
115851 ^ not all are they ministering spirits,
115856 ^ for service being sent forth,
115859 ^ for the sake of those being about
115862 ^ to inherit salvation?
115864 ^ because of this, it behooves
115867 ^ more abundantly to give heed us
115870 ^ to the things we have heard,
115872 ^ lest ever we should drift away.
115874 ^ if for the
115877 ^ by angels having been spoken word was unalterable,
115883 ^ and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense,
115891 ^ how we will escape
115894 ^ such a great having neglected
115896 ^ a salvation,
115897 ^ which
115898 ^ a commencement having received,
115900 ^ declared by the lord,
115904 ^ by those having heard, to us it was confirmed,
115910 ^ bearing witness - god by signs together with [them] and wonders, and by various miracles, and of [the] spirit holy distributions, according to the of him will.
115928 ^ not for to angels did he subject the world
115934 ^ that is coming,
115936 ^ of which we are speaking.
115939 ^ has testified however somewhere someone,
115943 ^ saying,
115944 ^ what is man,
115947 ^ that you are mindful of him,
115950 ^ or [the] son of man,
115953 ^ that you care for him?
115956 ^ you made lower him a little some than [the] angels;
115962 ^ with glory and honor you crowned him,
115967 ^ all things you have put in subjection under the feet of him.
115973 ^ in - for subjecting to him - all things, nothing he left to him unsubject.
115984 ^ at present however, not yet do we see to him - all things having been subjected.
115992 ^ who however
115994 ^ a little one than [the] angels, having been made lower, we see,
116000 ^ jesus,
116001 ^ because of the suffering - of death, with glory and with honor having been crowned,
116010 ^ so that by [the] grace of god for everyone he might taste death.
116017 ^ it was fitting for to him,
116020 ^ for whom [are] - all things
116024 ^ and by whom [are] - all things,
116029 ^ many sons to glory having brought, the archetype of the salvation of them, through sufferings to make perfect.
116042 ^ the [one] both for
116045 ^ sanctifying, and
116047 ^ those being sanctified, of one [are] all;
116052 ^ for which reason, not he is ashamed
116057 ^ brothers them to call,
116060 ^ saying:
116061 ^ i will declare the name of you to the brothers of me;
116068 ^ in [the] midst of [the] congregation i will sing praises of you.”
116073 ^ and again:
116075 ^ i will be
116077 ^ trusting in him.”
116080 ^ and again:
116082 ^ behold,
116083 ^ i and the children
116087 ^ whom to me has given - god.”
116092 ^ since therefore the children have partaken of blood and of flesh
116100 ^ also, he likewise took part in the same things,
116106 ^ so that through [his] death, he might destroy the [one]
116112 ^ the power holding
116115 ^ - of death,
116117 ^ that is, the devil,
116121 ^ and might set free those
116124 ^ who fear of death through all
116129 ^ [their time] to live, subject were
116133 ^ to slavery.
116134 ^ not for surely in that place [the] angels he helps,
116139 ^ but [the] seed of abraham he helps.
116143 ^ therefore it behooved [him]
116145 ^ in all things [his] brothers to be made like,
116150 ^ so that a merciful he might become,
116153 ^ and faithful, high priest [in] things relating to - god,
116160 ^ in order - to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
116167 ^ in that for has suffered he himself,
116172 ^ having been tempted,
116173 ^ he is able
116701 ^ having therefore a high priest great,
116705 ^ having passed through the heavens, jesus, the son - of god, we should hold firmly to [our] confession.
116716 ^ not for have we a high priest
116720 ^ not being able
116722 ^ to sympathize with the weaknesses of us;
116726 ^ [one] having been tempted however in all things by the same way, without sin.
116734 ^ we should come therefore with boldness to the throne - of grace,
116742 ^ so that we may receive mercy
116745 ^ and grace may find for in time of need help.
116751 ^ every for
116753 ^ high priest,
116754 ^ from among men being taken, on behalf of men is appointed, in things relating to - god
116764 ^ that he should offer gifts both and sacrifices for sins,
116787 ^ just as for the people, so also for himself, to offer sacrifices for sins.
116798 ^ and not upon himself anyone takes the honor,
116805 ^ but rather
116806 ^ being called by - god,
116810 ^ just as also aaron.
116813 ^ so also - christ not himself did glorify
116820 ^ to become a high priest,
116822 ^ but
116823 ^ the [one] having said to him:
116827 ^ son of me are you,
116831 ^ i today have begotten you.”
116835 ^ just as also in another [place] he says:
116840 ^ you [are] a priest to the age, according to the order of melchizedek.”
116849 ^ [he]
116850 ^ in the days of the flesh of him, prayers both and supplications,
116860 ^ to the [one] being able
116863 ^ to save him from death, with crying loud and tears having offered up,
116873 ^ and
116874 ^ having been heard, because of - reverence,
116878 ^ though being a son,
116881 ^ he learned
116882 ^ from the things he suffered, - obedience,
116887 ^ and
116888 ^ having been perfected, he became
116890 ^ to all those obeying him, [the] author
116895 ^ of salvation eternal,
116897 ^ having been designated by - god a high priest according to the order of melchizedek.
116906 ^ concerning this [there is] much from us - speech,
116912 ^ and difficult in interpretation
116914 ^ to speak,
116915 ^ since sluggish you have become
116918 ^ in the hearings.
116920 ^ even for
116922 ^ you ought
116923 ^ to be teachers by the time, again need of you have
117088 ^ [that] bringing forth however thorns and thistles [is] worthless and a curse near to,
117097 ^ of which the end [is] unto burning.
117102 ^ we are persuaded however concerning you, beloved, of better [things], and
117110 ^ [things] accompanying salvation,
117112 ^ if even like this we speak.
117116 ^ not for unjust [is] - god,
117121 ^ to forget the work of you and the love
117128 ^ that you have shown toward the name of him,
117134 ^ having ministered to the saints
117137 ^ and [still] ministering.
117139 ^ we desire now, each of you
117143 ^ the same to show,
117146 ^ earnestness, toward the full assurance of the hope unto [the] end,
117154 ^ so that not sluggish you may be,
117158 ^ imitators however
117168 ^ - for to abraham having made his promise, - god,
117174 ^ since
117175 ^ by no one he had greater to swear, he swore by himself,
117183 ^ saying,
117184 ^ if surely
117186 ^ blessing i will bless you,
117189 ^ and
117190 ^ multiplying i will multiply you.”
117193 ^ and thus
117195 ^ having waited patiently, he obtained the promise.
117199 ^ men for by [one] greater swear,
117205 ^ and of all their disputes an end, for confirmation, [is] the oath,
117214 ^ in which
117216 ^ more abundantly desiring - god
117865 ^ finding fault for with them, he says:
117869 ^ behold,
117870 ^ [the] days are coming,
117872 ^ says [the] lord,
117874 ^ and i will ratify with the house of israel and with the house of judah, a covenant new,
117887 ^ not according to the covenant
117891 ^ that i made with fathers of them, in [the] day
117898 ^ of having taken hold of by me the hand of them,
117903 ^ to lead them out of [the] land of egypt,
117908 ^ because they not did continue in the covenant of me,
117916 ^ and i disregarded them,
117919 ^ says [the] lord.
117921 ^ for this [is] the covenant
117925 ^ that i will make with the house of israel, after the days those,
117934 ^ says [the] lord,
118000 ^ in - saying, new, he has made obsolete the first;
118007 ^ that then
118009 ^ growing old
118010 ^ and aging [is] near vanishing.
118014 ^ had indeed therefore also the first, regulations of worship - and a sanctuary earthly.
118026 ^ a tabernacle for was prepared,
118029 ^ the first [room] —
118031 ^ in which [were] - both the lampstand, and the table, and of the presentation the bread —
118044 ^ which is called [the] holy [place].
118047 ^ behind now
118049 ^ the second veil [was] a tabernacle,
118053 ^ - being called the holy of holies,
118057 ^ [the] golden having
118059 ^ altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant,
118065 ^ having been covered around in every part with gold,
118068 ^ in which [was the] jar golden
118072 ^ having the manna, and the staff of aaron
118079 ^ - having budded, and the tablets of the covenant. above then it [were the] cherubim of glory,
118091 ^ overshadowing the mercy seat;
118094 ^ concerning which not it is now [the time]
118099 ^ to speak in detail.
118102 ^ these things now thus having been prepared,
118106 ^ into indeed
118108 ^ the first tabernacle at all times everything enter the priests,
118116 ^ the sacred services accomplishing.
118119 ^ [enters] into however
118121 ^ the second, once in the year only, the high priest,
118129 ^ not without blood,

118166 ^ in which gifts both and sacrifices are offered,
118173 ^ not being able
118175 ^ in regard to conscience to make perfect
118178 ^ the [one] worshiping, [consisting] only in foods and drinks and various washings, ordinances of [the] flesh,
118190 ^ until [the] time of reformation being imposed.
118194 ^ christ however,
118345 ^ having taken the blood - of calves and - of goats, with water, and wool scarlet, and hyssop, itself both the book and all the people he sprinkled,

118370 ^ this [is] the blood of the covenant,
118375 ^ which commanded unto you - god.”
118381 ^ and the tabernacle then,
118385 ^ and all the vessels of the ministry with blood likewise he sprinkled.
118395 ^ and almost with blood all things are purified, according to the law,
118404 ^ and apart from blood-shedding, not there is forgiveness.
118410 ^ [it was] necessary then [for]
118412 ^ the indeed
118414 ^ representations of the things in the heavens, with these to be purified,
118421 ^ themselves however
118423 ^ the heavenly things with better sacrifices than these.

118444 ^ now to appear in the presence - of god for us,
118452 ^ nor that repeatedly he should offer himself,
118457 ^ just as the high priest enters into the holy places every year with [the] blood of another.
118469 ^ otherwise it was necessary for
118471 ^ him repeatedly to have suffered from [the] foundation of [the] world.
118477 ^ now however once in [the] consummation of the ages, for [the] putting away of sin, by the sacrifice of himself he has been revealed.
118493 ^ and in as much as it is apportioned - to men
118499 ^ once to die,
118501 ^ after then
118503 ^ this [to face] judgment,

118798 ^ which he dedicated for us a way new,
118803 ^ and living, through the veil,
118808 ^ that is, the flesh of him, and [having] a priest great over the house - of god, we should draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith,
118828 ^ having been sprinkled clean [our] hearts from a conscience evil,
118834 ^ and having been washed [our] body with water pure.
118840 ^ we should hold fast to the confession of [our] hope, firmly;

118864 ^ as [is the] custom with some,
118867 ^ but encouraging [one another],

119196 ^ and of the according to faith righteousness [that is], he became
119202 ^ heir.
119203 ^ by faith

122452 ^ concerning this salvation, sought out

123282 ^ let him seek peace
123284 ^ and let him pursue it.
123287 ^ because [the] eyes of [the] lord [are] on [the] righteous,
123292 ^ and [the] ears of him toward prayer of them.
123298 ^ [the] face however
123300 ^ of [the] lord

123304 ^ and who [is]
123306 ^ he who will harm you,
123309 ^ if for that which [is] good, zealous you should be?
123314 ^ but if even you should suffer because of righteousness,
123320 ^ [you are] blessed.
123321 ^ - and
123323 ^ the threats of them not you should be afraid of,
123327 ^ neither should you be troubled.”
123329 ^ [as] lord however,
123331 ^ - christ sanctify in the hearts of you,
123338 ^ ready always
123340 ^ for a defense
123342 ^ to everyone - asking you an account concerning the in you hope;
123352 ^ yet with gentleness and fear,
123357 ^ a conscience having
123359 ^ good,
123360 ^ so that
123361 ^ in this they might speak against you, they shall be ashamed
123365 ^ those reviling your - good in christ manner of life.
123373 ^ [it is] better for
123375 ^ doing good
123376 ^ if wills [it] the will - of god, to suffer,
123383 ^ than
123384 ^ doing evil,
123385 ^ because also christ once for sins suffered,
123392 ^ [the] righteous for [the] unrighteous,
123395 ^ so that you he might bring - to god,
123400 ^ having been put to death indeed in [the] flesh,
123403 ^ having been made alive however in [the] spirit,
123406 ^ in which also to the in prison spirits,
123413 ^ having gone he preached,
123415 ^ having disobeyed at one time,
123417 ^ when was waiting the - of god longsuffering in [the] days of noah,
123426 ^ being prepared of [the] ark,
123428 ^ in which a few —
123431 ^ that is, eight souls — were saved through water,
123438 ^ which also you
123441 ^ prefigures now saving baptism,
123445 ^ not of flesh a putting away
123448 ^ of [the] filth,
123449 ^ but of a conscience good, [the] demand toward god, through [the] resurrection of jesus christ,
123459 ^ who is at [the] right hand - of god,
123465 ^ having gone into heaven,
123468 ^ having been subjected to him angels and authorities and powers.
123475 ^ christ therefore having suffered in [the] flesh,
123479 ^ also you the same mind arm yourselves with,
123485 ^ because
123486 ^ the [one] having suffered [in the] flesh is done with sin,
123491 ^ so as - no longer to men’s desires but to [the] will of god, the remaining in [the] flesh
123503 ^ to live
123504 ^ time.
123505 ^ [is] sufficient for the
123508 ^ past time
123510 ^ the desire of the gentiles to have carried out,
123515 ^ having walked in sensuality, lusts, drunkenness, orgies, carousing, and abominable idolatries.
123525 ^ with respect to this they think it strange,
123528 ^ not running with [them] of you into the same - of debauchery overflow,
123537 ^ speaking evil [of you],
123538 ^ who will give account
123541 ^ to him who ready
123543 ^ is
123544 ^ to judge
123545 ^ [the] living and [the] dead.
123548 ^ to this [end] indeed, even to [the] dead the gospel was proclaimed,
123554 ^ so that they might be judged indeed according to men in [the] flesh;
123560 ^ they might live however according to god in [the] spirit.
123565 ^ of all now
123567 ^ the end has drawn near.
123570 ^ be clear-minded therefore,
123572 ^ and sober for the purpose of prayers,
123576 ^ above all things,
123578 ^ - among yourselves love fervent having,
123584 ^ because love covers over a multitude of sins,
123589 ^ hospitable to one another, without complaint,
123594 ^ each
123595 ^ as has received a gift, to each other
123600 ^ them serving, as good stewards of [the] manifold grace of god:
123608 ^ if anyone speaks,
123611 ^ as oracles of god;
123614 ^ if anyone serves,
123617 ^ as of strength
123620 ^ which supplies - god,
123624 ^ so that in all things may be glorified - god through jesus christ,
123633 ^ to whom be the glory and the power to the ages of the ages. amen.
123646 ^ beloved, not be surprised at the among you fire
123653 ^ for a trial to you taking place,
123657 ^ as if a strange thing to you were happening.
123661 ^ but as you have shared in the - of christ sufferings,
123668 ^ rejoice,
123669 ^ so that also in the revelation of the glory of him, you may rejoice
123678 ^ exulting.
123679 ^ if you are insulted in [the] name of christ,
123684 ^ [you are] blessed,
123685 ^ because the - of glory and - - of god spirit upon you rests.
123697 ^ not for any of you let suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evildoer, or as a troublesome meddler;
123711 ^ if however as a christian,
123715 ^ not let him be ashamed;
123717 ^ let him glorify however - god in the name this.
123725 ^ for [it is] the time [for]
123728 ^ - to have begun the judgment from the house - of god;
123737 ^ if now first from us,
123742 ^ what [will be] the outcome
123745 ^ of those disobeying the - of god gospel?
123751 ^ and, if the righteous [one] with difficulty is saved,
123757 ^ the ungodly and sinner where will appear?”
123763 ^ therefore also,
123765 ^ those suffering according to the will - of god, to [the] faithful creator let them commit the souls of them in well doing.
123780 ^ elders - among you, i exhort,
123785 ^ - a fellow elder and witness of the - of christ sufferings, who [am] also

123807 ^ exercising oversight
123808 ^ not under compulsion,
123810 ^ but willingly, according to god;
123814 ^ and not for base gain,
123816 ^ but eagerly;
123818 ^ not
123819 ^ as exercising lordship over - those in your charge,
123823 ^ but
123824 ^ examples being
123826 ^ to the flock.
123828 ^ and having been revealed the chief shepherd,
123832 ^ you will receive the unfading - of glory crown.
123838 ^ likewise, younger [ones], be subject to [your] elders.
123842 ^ all now one to another - humility gird on,

123857 ^ be humbled therefore under the mighty hand - of god,
123865 ^ so that you he may exalt in [due] time,

124748 ^ letter,
124749 ^ in which i am stirring up of you in putting [you] in remembrance
124755 ^ - pure mind,
124758 ^ to remember the having been spoken beforehand words — by the holy prophets and of the - apostles through your — commandment
124772 ^ of the lord and savior,
124776 ^ this first knowing,
124779 ^ that will come in [the] last of the days with scoffing scoffers,
124788 ^ according to - own evil desires of them following
124794 ^ and saying,
124796 ^ where is the promise of the coming of him?
124803 ^ from [the time] that for the fathers fell asleep,
124809 ^ all things as they were continue from [the] beginning of creation.
124815 ^ it is concealed from indeed them
124818 ^ this willingly,
124820 ^ that heavens existed long ago,
124824 ^ and [the] earth
124826 ^ out of water and through water having been composed by the - of god word,
124836 ^ through which the at that time world,
124841 ^ with water having been deluged, perished.
124844 ^ - but
124846 ^ now the heavens and the earth,
124851 ^ by the same word having been stored up exist, for fire
124857 ^ being kept unto [the] day of judgment and destruction - of ungodly men.
124866 ^ [this] one however
124868 ^ thing not let be hidden from you, beloved,
124873 ^ that one day with [the] lord [is] like a thousand years,
124881 ^ and a thousand years like day one.
124887 ^ not does delay the lord the promise,
124892 ^ as some slowness esteem,
124896 ^ but is patient toward you,
124900 ^ not willing
124902 ^ [for] any to perish,
124904 ^ but all to repentance to come.
124909 ^ will come however [the] day of [the] lord like a thief,
124915 ^ in which the heavens with a roar will pass away,
124921 ^ elements then
124923 ^ burning with heat will be dissolved,
124925 ^ and [the] earth and the in it works not will be found.
124934 ^ these things in this way
124936 ^ all being dissolved,
127434 ^ many things having
127436 ^ to you to write, not i purposed
127440 ^ with paper and ink;
127444 ^ but i hope
127446 ^ to come to you,
127449 ^ and mouth to mouth to speak,
127454 ^ so that the joy of us may be.
127459 ^ having been completed

127487 ^ just as prospers your - soul.
127492 ^ i rejoiced for exceedingly
127495 ^ coming of [the] brothers
127497 ^ and bearing witness of your - truth,
127502 ^ just as you in truth are walking.
127507 ^ greater than these things not i have joy,
127512 ^ that i should hear of - my children
127517 ^ in [the] truth walking.
127520 ^ beloved, faithfully you are doing
127523 ^ whatever if you might have done toward the brothers, and they are strangers,
127532 ^ who testified of your - love before [the] church,
127539 ^ whom well you will do,
127542 ^ having set forward worthily - of god.
127546 ^ on behalf for
127548 ^ of the name they went forth,
127551 ^ nothing accepting from the gentiles.
127556 ^ we therefore ought
127559 ^ to receive - such [men],
127562 ^ so that fellow workers we may be in the truth.
127567 ^ i have written something to the church;
127571 ^ but
127572 ^ the [one] loving to be first among them, diotrephes, not welcomes us.
127579 ^ because of this, if i might come,
127583 ^ i will bring to remembrance of him the works
127587 ^ which he is doing,
127589 ^ with words evil prating against us;
127593 ^ and
127594 ^ not being satisfied with these, neither himself he receives the brothers,
127603 ^ and
127604 ^ those purposing, he forbids,
127607 ^ and from the church he casts [them] out.
127612 ^ beloved, not do imitate what [is] evil,
127617 ^ but what [is] good.
136486 ^ living were cast the two into the lake - of fire,
136495 ^ - burning with brimstone.
136499 ^ and the rest were killed with the sword
136506 ^ of the [one] sitting on the horse
136511 ^ - having gone forth out of the mouth of him.
136517 ^ and all the birds were filled with the flesh of them.
136526 ^ and i saw an angel
136529 ^ descending out of - heaven,
136533 ^ holding the key of the abyss, and a chain great in the hand of him.
136545 ^ and he seized the dragon,
136549 ^ the serpent - ancient,
136553 ^ who is [the] devil and - satan,
136559 ^ and bound him for a thousand years.
136564 ^ and he cast him into the abyss,
136570 ^ and shut
136572 ^ and sealed [it] over him,
136576 ^ so that not he should deceive any longer the nations,
136582 ^ until were completed the thousand years.
136587 ^ after these things, it is necessary for
136590 ^ to be released him for a little time.
136594 ^ and i saw thrones,
136597 ^ and they sat upon them,
136601 ^ and judgment was given to them,
136605 ^ and the souls
136608 ^ of those having been beheaded because of the testimony of jesus and because of the word - of god,
136620 ^ and those who not did worship the beast, nor the image of him,
136630 ^ and not did take the mark upon the forehead, and upon the hand of them.
136643 ^ and they lived
136645 ^ and reigned with - christ a thousand years.
136652 ^ the rest of the dead not lived again
136658 ^ until shall have been completed the thousand years.
136663 ^ this [is] the resurrection - first.
136668 ^ blessed and holy [is]
136671 ^ the [one] having a part in the resurrection - first!
136679 ^ over these the second death not has power,
136687 ^ but they will be priests - of god and - of christ,
136695 ^ and will reign with him a thousand years.
136702 ^ and when shall have been completed the thousand years,
136708 ^ will be released - satan out of the prison of him,
136715 ^ and will go out
136717 ^ to deceive the nations - in the four corners of the earth, - gog and magog,
136731 ^ to gather together them unto the war,
136736 ^ of whom the number [is]
136739 ^ of them like the sand of the sea.
136745 ^ and they marched up over the breadth of the earth
136752 ^ and encircled the camp of the saints and the city
136761 ^ - having been beloved.
136763 ^ but came down fire out of - heaven
136769 ^ and devoured them.
136772 ^ and the devil,
136775 ^ the [one] deceiving them, was cast into the lake - of fire and of sulfur,
136786 ^ where [are] also the beast and the false prophet;
136793 ^ and they will be tormented day and night to the ages of the ages.
136803 ^ and i saw a throne great white, and
136809 ^ the [one] sitting on it,
136813 ^ whose from - face fled the earth and - heaven,
136823 ^ and place not was found for them.
136828 ^ and i saw the dead, - great and - small,
136837 ^ standing before the throne,
136841 ^ and books were opened.
136844 ^ and another book was opened,
136848 ^ which is the [one] of life.
136852 ^ and were judged the dead
136856 ^ out of the things having been written in the books, according to the deeds of them.
136866 ^ and gave up the sea the dead who were in it;
136875 ^ and - death and - hades gave up the dead who were in them;
136887 ^ and they were judged each [of them] according to the works of them.
136894 ^ and - death and - hades were cast into the lake - of fire.
136906 ^ this the death - second is
136912 ^ the lake of fire.
136916 ^ and if anyone not was found
136921 ^ in the book - of life having been written,
136927 ^ he was cast into the lake - of fire.
136933 ^ and i saw a heaven new, and an earth new,
136940 ^ - for
136942 ^ the first heaven and the first earth had passed away,
136949 ^ and the sea not is any longer.
136955 ^ and the city - holy, [the] jerusalem new, i saw
136963 ^ coming down out of - heaven from - god,
136970 ^ having been prepared as a bride
136973 ^ having been adorned for the husband of her.
136977 ^ and i heard a voice great
136981 ^ from the throne, saying:
136985 ^ behold,
136986 ^ the tabernacle - of god [is] with - men,
136993 ^ and he will tabernacle with them,
136997 ^ and they peoples of him will be,
