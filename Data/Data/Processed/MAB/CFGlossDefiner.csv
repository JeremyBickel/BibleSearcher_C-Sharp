19620 ^ - the withered,
19623 ^ hand
19624 ^ having
22882 ^ of whom had
22884 ^ the little daughter of her spirit unclean,
22889 ^ having come, fell at the feet of him.
22895 ^ - now
22897 ^ the woman was gentile, syrophoenician by race,
22903 ^ and kept asking him
22906 ^ that the demon he should cast forth out of the daughter of her.
22914 ^ and he was saying to her,
22917 ^ permit first
22919 ^ to be satisfied the children;
22922 ^ not for it is good
22926 ^ to take the bread of the children,
22931 ^ and to the dogs to cast [it].
22935 ^ - but she answered
22938 ^ and says to him,
22941 ^ lord; even the dogs under the table eat of the crumbs of the children.
22954 ^ and he said to her,
22957 ^ because of this - word, go;
22962 ^ has gone forth out of the daughter of you the demon.
22969 ^ and
22970 ^ having gone away to the home of her, she found the child
22978 ^ lying on the bed, and the demon
22985 ^ having gone out.
22986 ^ and again
22988 ^ having departed from the region of tyre, he came through sidon, to the sea - of galilee through [the] midst of the region of [the] decapolis.
23006 ^ and they bring to him a deaf man and who spoke with difficulty,
23012 ^ and they implore him
23015 ^ that he might lay on him the hand.
23020 ^ and
23021 ^ having taken away him from the crowd aside privately, he put the fingers of him to the ears of him,
23036 ^ and
23037 ^ having spit, he touched the tongue of him,
23042 ^ and
23043 ^ having looked up to - heaven he sighed deeply,
23048 ^ and he says to him,
23051 ^ ephphatha!
23052 ^ that is, be opened!”
23055 ^ and immediately were opened his - ears,
23061 ^ and was loosed the band of the tongue of him,
23068 ^ and he began speaking plainly.
23071 ^ and he instructed them
23074 ^ that no one they should tell.
23077 ^ as much as however he kept instructing
23081 ^ them, more abundantly they were proclaiming [it].
23085 ^ and above measure they were astonished,
23088 ^ saying,
23089 ^ well all things he has done;
23092 ^ both
23093 ^ the deaf he makes
23096 ^ to hear,
23097 ^ and the mute to speak.
23101 ^ in those - days, again great [the] crowd being
23109 ^ and not having
23112 ^ what they might eat,
23347 ^ hardened do you have
23349 ^ the heart of you?
25674 ^ having leaves, he went
25677 ^ if perhaps anything he will find on it.
25683 ^ and
25684 ^ having come to it, nothing he found,
25689 ^ if not leaves;
25692 ^ the for
25694 ^ season not it was of figs.
25698 ^ and
25699 ^ answering, he said to it,
25702 ^ no more to the age, of you no one fruit may eat.
25711 ^ and were listening the disciples of him.
25716 ^ and they come to jerusalem.
25720 ^ and
25721 ^ having entered into the temple, he began
25726 ^ to cast out
25727 ^ those selling
25729 ^ and those buying in the temple;
25735 ^ and the tables of the money changers and the seats
25743 ^ of those selling the doves he overturned.
25748 ^ and not he would permit
25751 ^ that anyone should carry a vessel through the temple.
25758 ^ and he began teaching,
25760 ^ and was saying to them,
25763 ^ not has it been written
25765 ^ -: the house of me a house of prayer will be called for all the nations’
25775 ^ you however have made it a den of robbers.’
25781 ^ and heard [it] the chief priests and the scribes,
25788 ^ and they were seeking
25790 ^ how him they might destroy;
25793 ^ they were afraid of for him;
25796 ^ all for
25798 ^ the crowd was astonished at the teaching of him.
25805 ^ and when evening came,
25809 ^ they were going forth out of the city.
25813 ^ and
25814 ^ passing by in the morning, they saw the fig tree
25819 ^ having been dried up from [the] roots.
25822 ^ and
25823 ^ having remembered, - peter says to him,
25828 ^ rabbi, look,
25830 ^ the fig tree
25832 ^ that you cursed is dried up.
25835 ^ and
25836 ^ answering, - jesus says to them,
25841 ^ have faith from god.
25844 ^ truly i say to you
25847 ^ that whoever - shall say to the mountain this,
25854 ^ be you taken away
25855 ^ and be you cast into the sea,’
25860 ^ and not shall doubt in the heart of him,
25867 ^ but shall believe
25869 ^ that
25870 ^ what he says takes place,
25873 ^ it will be done for him.
25875 ^ because of this i say to you,
25879 ^ all things whatever praying,
25882 ^ also you ask, believe
25885 ^ that you receive,
25887 ^ and it will be to you.
25890 ^ and when you may stand
25893 ^ praying,
25894 ^ forgive
25895 ^ if anything you have against anyone,
25900 ^ so that also the father of you, who [is] in the heavens, might forgive you the trespasses of you.”
25914 ^ and they come again to jerusalem.
25919 ^ and in the temple is walking as he,
25925 ^ come to him the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
25936 ^ and they were saying to him,
25939 ^ by what authority these things are you doing?
25944 ^ or, who you gave the authority this,
25951 ^ that these things you should do?
25954 ^ - and
25956 ^ jesus said to them,
25959 ^ i will ask you one question,
25963 ^ and you answer me,
25966 ^ and i will tell you
25969 ^ by what authority these things i do.
25974 ^ the baptism - of john,
25978 ^ from heaven was it,
25981 ^ or from men?
25984 ^ answer me.
25986 ^ and they began reasoning with themselves,
25990 ^ saying,
25991 ^ if we should say, from heaven,
25995 ^ he will say,
25996 ^ because of why then not did you believe him?
26002 ^ but should we say, from men’...
26006 ^ they were afraid of the people;
26009 ^ all for were holding - john
26014 ^ truly that a prophet he was.
26018 ^ and
26019 ^ answering - to jesus, they say,
26023 ^ not do we know.
26025 ^ and - jesus says to them,
26030 ^ neither i tell you
26034 ^ by what authority these things i do.
26039 ^ and he began
26041 ^ to them in parables to speak:
26045 ^ a vineyard a man planted,
26048 ^ and he placed around [it] a fence,
26051 ^ and dug a wine vat,
26054 ^ and built a tower,
26057 ^ and rented out it to farmers,
26061 ^ and traveled abroad.
26063 ^ and he sent to the farmers at the due time a servant,
26071 ^ that from the farmers he might receive from the fruit of the vineyard.
26081 ^ but
26082 ^ having taken him, they beat [him]
26085 ^ and sent [him] away empty-handed.
26088 ^ and again he sent to them another servant,
26095 ^ and him they struck on the head
26097 ^ and treated shamefully.
26099 ^ and another he sent,
26102 ^ and him they killed;
26104 ^ also many others,
26107 ^ some indeed beating,
26110 ^ some then killing.
26113 ^ yet one having
26116 ^ son beloved,
26118 ^ he sent him last to them,
26123 ^ saying
26124 ^ -, they will have respect for the son of me.
26129 ^ those however
26131 ^ - farmers to themselves said
26136 ^ -, this is the heir;
26141 ^ come,
26142 ^ let us kill him,
26144 ^ and ours will be the inheritance.
26149 ^ and
26150 ^ having taken, they killed him
26153 ^ and cast forth him outside the vineyard.
26159 ^ what therefore will do the master of the vineyard?
26166 ^ he will come
26167 ^ and will destroy the farmers,
26171 ^ and will give the vineyard to others.
26176 ^ not even the scripture this have you read:
26181 ^ [the] stone
26182 ^ which rejected
26184 ^ those building,
26186 ^ this has become the chief corner;
26191 ^ from [the] lord was this,
26195 ^ and it is marvelous in [the] eyes of us.’
26201 ^ and they were seeking
26203 ^ him to lay hold of,
26205 ^ and they feared the crowd;
26209 ^ they knew for
26211 ^ that against them the parable he had spoken.
26217 ^ and
26218 ^ having left him, they went away.
26221 ^ and they send to him some of the pharisees, and of the herodians,
26231 ^ that him they might catch in discourse.
26235 ^ and
26236 ^ having come, they say to him,
26239 ^ teacher, we know
26241 ^ that true you are,
26244 ^ and not there is care to you about no one;
26250 ^ not for you look on [the] appearance of men,
26256 ^ but on the basis of [the] truth the way - of god teach.
26264 ^ is it lawful
26265 ^ to give tribute to caesar
26268 ^ or not?
26270 ^ should we pay
26271 ^ or not pay?
26274 ^ - and
26276 ^ knowing of them the hypocrisy, he said to them,
26282 ^ why me do you test?
26285 ^ bring me a denarius,
26288 ^ that i might see [it].
26290 ^ - and they brought [it].
26293 ^ and he says to them,
26296 ^ whose [is] the likeness this, and the inscription?
26303 ^ - and they said to him,
26307 ^ caesar’s.
26308 ^ - and
26310 ^ jesus said to them,
26313 ^ the things of caesar, give back to caesar,
26317 ^ and the things - of god, - to god.
26323 ^ and they were amazed at him.
26327 ^ and come sadducees to him,
26332 ^ who say
26334 ^ a resurrection not there is,
26337 ^ and they began questioning him,
26340 ^ saying,
26341 ^ teacher, moses wrote for us
26345 ^ that if of anyone a brother should die,
26350 ^ and leave behind a wife,
26353 ^ and not leave children,
26357 ^ that should take the brother of him the wife,
26364 ^ and raise up seed for the brother of him.
26370 ^ seven brothers there were;
26373 ^ and the first took a wife,
26378 ^ and,
26379 ^ dying, not left seed.
26383 ^ and the second took her,
26388 ^ and died,
26390 ^ not having left seed;
26393 ^ and the third likewise.
26397 ^ and the seven not left seed.
26403 ^ last of all also, the woman died.
26409 ^ in the resurrection,
26412 ^ when they rise, of which of them will she be
26417 ^ wife?
26418 ^ - for
26420 ^ the seven had her as wife.
26424 ^ was saying to them - jesus,
26428 ^ not because of this do you err,
26432 ^ not knowing the scriptures,
26436 ^ nor the power - of god?
26441 ^ when for out from [the] dead they rise,
26446 ^ neither do they marry,
26448 ^ nor are given in marriage;
26450 ^ but are like angels in the heavens.
26457 ^ concerning now
26459 ^ the dead,
26461 ^ that they rise, not have you read in the book of moses, on the bush,
26472 ^ how spoke to him - god,
26477 ^ saying,
26478 ^ i [am] the god of abraham, and the god of isaac, and the god of jacob’
26490 ^ not he is god of [the] dead,
26494 ^ but
26495 ^ of [the] living.
26496 ^ greatly you err.
26498 ^ and
26499 ^ having come up one of the scribes,
26503 ^ having heard them
26505 ^ reasoning together,
26506 ^ having seen
26507 ^ that well he answered them, he questioned him,
26513 ^ which is
26515 ^ commandment [the] first of all?
26518 ^ answered - jesus,
26521 ^ the foremost is,
26524 ^ hear this o israel:
26526 ^ [the] lord - god of us, [the] lord one is,
26533 ^ and you shall love [the] lord - god of you with all the heart of you, and with all the soul of you, and with all the mind of you, and with all the strength of you.’
26562 ^ [the] second this:
26564 ^ you shall love the neighbor of you as yourself.’
26570 ^ greater than these another commandment not there is.
26576 ^ and said to him the scribe,
26581 ^ right, teacher,
26583 ^ according to truth you have spoken
26586 ^ that one he is,
26589 ^ and not there is another besides him,
26595 ^ and
26596 ^ - to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength,
26613 ^ and - to love the neighbor as oneself more important is
26622 ^ than all the burnt offerings and sacrifices.
26627 ^ and - jesus,
26630 ^ having seen him
26632 ^ that wisely he answered, said to him,
26637 ^ not far are you from the kingdom - of god.
26645 ^ and no one no longer dared
26649 ^ him to question.
26651 ^ and
26652 ^ answering, - jesus was saying,
26656 ^ teaching in the temple,
26660 ^ how say the scribes
26664 ^ that the christ, [the] son of david is?
26670 ^ himself david said by the spirit - holy:
26678 ^ said [the] lord to the lord of me,
26683 ^ sit at [the] right hand of me,
26687 ^ until - i place of the enemies of you [as] a footstool of the feet of you.”’
26697 ^ himself david calls him lord,
26702 ^ then how of him is he
26706 ^ son?
26707 ^ and the great crowd was listening to him gladly.
26714 ^ and in the teaching of him, he was saying,
26720 ^ beware of the scribes,
26724 ^ - desiring
26726 ^ in robes to walk about, and greetings in the marketplaces, and first seats in the synagogues, and first places at the feasts;
26744 ^ those devouring the houses of the widows,
26750 ^ and as a pretext, at great length praying.
26754 ^ these will receive greater judgment.
26758 ^ and
26759 ^ having sat down opposite the treasury, he was watching
26764 ^ how the crowd cast money into the treasury;
26772 ^ and many rich were casting [in] much.
26777 ^ and
26778 ^ having come, one widow poor cast [in] lepta two,
26785 ^ which is a kodrantes.
26788 ^ and
26789 ^ having called to [him] the disciples of him, he says to them,
26795 ^ truly i say to you
26798 ^ that the widow this - poor, more
26805 ^ than all has cast [in]
26807 ^ of those casting into the treasury.
26812 ^ all for
26814 ^ out of that which was abounding to them cast [in];
26819 ^ she however, out of the poverty of her,
26825 ^ all as much as she had cast [in],
26829 ^ all the livelihood of her.
26833 ^ and going forth of him out of the temple,
26839 ^ says to him one of the disciples of him,
26845 ^ teacher, behold
26847 ^ what stones and what buildings!
26852 ^ and - jesus said to him,
26857 ^ see you these - great buildings?
26862 ^ no not shall be left here stone upon stone,
26869 ^ which no not shall be thrown down.
26873 ^ and sitting of him upon the mount - of olives, opposite the temple,
26884 ^ asked him in private peter and james and john and andrew,
26895 ^ tell us
26897 ^ when these things will be?
26900 ^ and what [will be] the sign
26904 ^ when are going these things
29613 ^ the [things] being instructed to [those] around - peter. promptly they reported
29621 ^ after moreover,
29623 ^ these, also himself - jesus from [the] east and to [the] west, sent out through them, the sacred and imperishable preaching of eternal salvation. amen.
29645 ^ inasmuch as many have undertaken
29648 ^ to draw up a narration concerning the
29652 ^ having been accomplished among us things,
29656 ^ as delivered [them] to us
29659 ^ those from [the] beginning eyewitnesses and servants
29665 ^ having been
29666 ^ of the word,
29668 ^ it seemed good also to me,
29670 ^ having been acquainted from the first with all things, carefully
29674 ^ with method to you to write, most excellent theophilus,
29679 ^ so that you may know
29681 ^ concerning which you were instructed, [of the] things, the certainty.
29687 ^ there was in the days of herod king - of judea a priest certain, named zechariah, of [the] division of abijah,
29702 ^ and wife of him of the daughters of aaron,
29709 ^ and the name of her elizabeth.
29714 ^ they were now righteous both before - god,
29721 ^ walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless.
29731 ^ and no there was to them child,
29736 ^ inasmuch as was - elizabeth barren,
29741 ^ and both
29743 ^ advanced in the years of them were.
29749 ^ it came to pass now
29751 ^ in the fulfilling the priestly service of him, in the order of the division of him before - god,
29764 ^ according to the custom of the priesthood, it fell to him by lot
29770 ^ - to burn incense,
29772 ^ having entered into the temple of the lord.
29778 ^ and all the multitude were
29783 ^ of the people
29785 ^ praying outside at the hour of the incense.
29791 ^ appeared then to him an angel of [the] lord,
29796 ^ standing at [the] right of the altar of the incense.
29803 ^ and was troubled zechariah
29806 ^ having seen [him],
29807 ^ and fear fell upon him.
29812 ^ said then to him the angel,
29818 ^ not fear, zechariah,
29821 ^ because has been heard the prayer of you,
29826 ^ and the wife of you elizabeth will bear a son to you,
29834 ^ and you shall call the name of him john.
29840 ^ and he will be joy to you
29844 ^ and gladness,
29846 ^ and many at the birth of him will rejoice.
29853 ^ he will be for great before the lord;
29859 ^ and wine and strong drink no not shall he drink,
29866 ^ and [of the] spirit holy he will be filled even from [the] womb of [the] mother of him.
29875 ^ and many of the sons of israel he will turn to [the] lord, the god of them.
29886 ^ and he will go forth before him in [the] spirit and power of elijah,
29896 ^ to turn [the] hearts of [the] fathers to [the] children,
29901 ^ and [the] disobedient to [the] wisdom of [the] righteous,
29906 ^ to make ready for [the] lord a people
29909 ^ prepared.
29910 ^ and said zechariah to the angel,
29916 ^ by what will i know this?
29920 ^ i for am an old man,
29924 ^ and the wife of me
29928 ^ is advanced in the years of her.
29933 ^ and
29934 ^ answering, the angel said to him,
29939 ^ i am gabriel,
29942 ^ the [one] standing before - god,
29947 ^ and i was sent
29949 ^ to speak to you,
29952 ^ and to bring glad tidings to you these.
29956 ^ and behold,
29958 ^ you will be
29959 ^ silent,
29960 ^ and not able
29963 ^ to speak
29964 ^ until that day shall take place these things,
29969 ^ in return for that not you did believe the words of me,
29976 ^ which will be fulfilled in the season of them.
29982 ^ and were the people
29986 ^ expecting - zechariah,
29989 ^ and they were wondering
29991 ^ at the delaying in the temple of him.
31224 ^ whose name [was] simeon;
31227 ^ and the man this [was] righteous and devout,
31234 ^ waiting for [the] consolation - of israel,
31238 ^ and [the] spirit was
31241 ^ holy upon him.
31244 ^ and it was
31246 ^ to him divinely revealed by the spirit - holy
31253 ^ not to see death
31256 ^ before that - he should see the christ of [the] lord.
31263 ^ and he came in the spirit into the temple;
31271 ^ and
31272 ^ in the [time when] were bringing in the parents the child jesus,
31280 ^ the [thing] were doing they
31283 ^ according to that having become customary by the law for him, then he received him into the arms,
31297 ^ and blessed - god,
31301 ^ and said:
31303 ^ now you dismiss the servant of you, lord, according to the word of you, in peace;
31315 ^ for have seen the eyes of me the salvation of you,
31323 ^ which you have prepared before [the] face of all the peoples,
31330 ^ a light for revelation of [the] gentiles,
31334 ^ and glory of [the] people of you, israel.
31339 ^ and were the father of him, and the mother,
31347 ^ marveling
31348 ^ at the things having been spoken concerning him.
31353 ^ and blessed them simeon,
31357 ^ and said to mary the mother of him:
31364 ^ behold,
31365 ^ this [child] is appointed for [the] falling and rising up of many in - israel, and for a sign
31378 ^ spoken against —
31379 ^ and of you also
31382 ^ of her the soul will go through a sword —
31387 ^ so that - may be revealed of many hearts [the] thoughts.
31394 ^ and there was anna, a prophetess, daughter of phanuel, of [the] tribe of asher,
31403 ^ she
31404 ^ being advanced in years great,
31408 ^ having lived with a husband years seven from the marriage of herself,
31417 ^ and she [was] a widow of about years eighty [and] four,
31424 ^ who not departed the temple,
31429 ^ with fastings and prayers serving night and day.
31436 ^ and she at that hour
31440 ^ having come up, was giving praise - to god,
31444 ^ and was speaking concerning him
31448 ^ to all those waiting for [the] redemption of jerusalem.
31453 ^ and when they had performed everything - according to the law of [the] lord,
31462 ^ they returned to - galilee, to the town of them, nazareth.
31470 ^ - and
31472 ^ the child continued to grow
31474 ^ and become strong,
31476 ^ being filled with wisdom,
31478 ^ and [the] grace of god was upon him.
31484 ^ and were going the parents of him every year to jerusalem at the feast of the passover.
31497 ^ and when he was years [old] twelve,
31502 ^ having gone up they according to the custom of the feast,
31509 ^ and having completed the days,
32641 ^ has been done in - capernaum,
32645 ^ do also here in the hometown of you.
32652 ^ he said then,
32654 ^ truly i say to you
32657 ^ that no prophet acceptable is in the hometown of him.
32666 ^ in truth now i say to you,
32671 ^ many widows there were in the days of elijah in - israel,
32681 ^ when was shut up the heaven for years three and months six,
32691 ^ when there was a famine great upon all the land;
32699 ^ and to none of them was sent elijah,
32705 ^ if not to zarephath - of sidon, to a woman, a widow.
32714 ^ and many lepers were in - israel in the time of elisha the prophet,
32725 ^ and none of them was cleansed,
32729 ^ if not naaman the syrian.”
32734 ^ and were filled all with anger in the synagogue,
32741 ^ hearing these things;
32743 ^ and
32744 ^ having risen up, they cast him out of [the] city
32750 ^ and led him unto brow of the hill
32757 ^ upon which the town had been built
32762 ^ of them,
32763 ^ in order to throw over him;
32766 ^ he however,
32768 ^ having passed through [the] midst of them, went away.
32773 ^ and he went down to capernaum, a city - of galilee.
32780 ^ and he was
32782 ^ teaching them on the sabbaths;
32787 ^ and they were astonished at the teaching of him,
32793 ^ for with authority was the message of him.
32800 ^ and in the synagogue was a man
32806 ^ having a spirit of a demon unclean;
32810 ^ and he cried out in a voice loud,
32814 ^ ha! what to us and to you, jesus, of nazareth?
32821 ^ are you come
32822 ^ to destroy us?
32824 ^ i know you
32826 ^ who are,
32828 ^ the holy [one] - of god.
32832 ^ and rebuked him - jesus,
32837 ^ saying,
32838 ^ be silent
32839 ^ and come forth out of him!
32843 ^ and
32844 ^ having thrown him the demon into the midst, it came out from him,
32854 ^ in nothing having hurt him.
32857 ^ and came astonishment upon all,
32862 ^ and they were speaking to one another,
32866 ^ saying,
32867 ^ what - word [is] this,
32871 ^ that with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits,
32880 ^ and they come out?
32882 ^ and was spreading the report concerning him into every place of the surrounding region.
34263 ^ to those hearing:
34265 ^ love the enemies of you,
34269 ^ good do
34271 ^ to those hating you,
34274 ^ bless
34275 ^ those cursing you,
34278 ^ pray
34279 ^ for those mistreating you.
40234 ^ watching.
40235 ^ truly i say to you
40238 ^ that he will gird himself
40240 ^ and will make recline them,
40243 ^ and
40244 ^ having come up, will serve them.
40247 ^ and if in the second and if in the third watch he comes
40257 ^ and finds [them] thus,
40260 ^ blessed are those!
40263 ^ this however know,
40266 ^ that if had known the master of the house
40271 ^ in what hour the thief is coming,
40276 ^ not - he would have allowed
40279 ^ to be broken into the house of him.
40283 ^ also you be ready;
40287 ^ for
40288 ^ in the hour not you expect, the son - of man comes.
40297 ^ said then - peter,
40301 ^ lord, to us the parable this speak you,
40308 ^ or also to all?
40312 ^ and said the lord,
40316 ^ who then is the faithful manager [and] the wise,
40324 ^ whom will set the master over the care [of servants] of him,
40332 ^ - to give [them] in season the measure of food?
40338 ^ blessed [is] the servant that
40342 ^ whom
40343 ^ having come, the master of him will find
40348 ^ doing thus.
40350 ^ of a truth i say to you
40353 ^ that
40354 ^ over all the possessions of him he will set him.
40361 ^ if however should say the servant that in the heart of him,
40371 ^ delays the master of me
40375 ^ to come,
40376 ^ and should begin
40378 ^ to beat the men-servants and the maid-servants,
40384 ^ to eat also
40386 ^ and to drink
40388 ^ and to get drunk,
40390 ^ will come the master of the servant that in a day
40398 ^ in which not he does expect, and in an hour
40404 ^ that not he knows,
40407 ^ and he will cut in two him
40410 ^ and the place of him with the unbelievers will appoint.
40418 ^ that now
40420 ^ - servant,
40422 ^ the [one] having known the will of the master of him
40429 ^ and not having prepared,
40432 ^ nor having done according to the will of him, will be beaten with many [blows];
40440 ^ the [one] however
40442 ^ not having known,
40444 ^ having done however [things] worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few.
40450 ^ everyone now
40452 ^ to whom has been given much,
40455 ^ much will be required from him;
40459 ^ and to whom has been committed much,
40463 ^ the more will they ask of him.
40746 ^ planted in the vineyard of him;
40751 ^ and he came
40753 ^ seeking fruit on it,
40757 ^ and not did find [any].
40760 ^ he said then to the vinedresser,
40765 ^ behold,
40766 ^ three years
40768 ^ throughout these i come
40771 ^ seeking fruit on the fig tree this,
40777 ^ and not do find [any].
40780 ^ cut down therefore it,
40783 ^ that why even the ground should it use up?
40788 ^ - and
40790 ^ answering, he says to him,
40793 ^ sir, let alone it also this the year,
40800 ^ until when i shall dig around it,
40805 ^ and put [in] manure,
40808 ^ and if indeed it should bear fruit
40812 ^ in the [time], so be it.
40815 ^ if however not,
40818 ^ you will cut down it.
40820 ^ he was now
40822 ^ teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbaths.
40830 ^ and behold,
40832 ^ a woman
40833 ^ a spirit having
40835 ^ of infirmity, years ten [and] eight.
40838 ^ and she was
40840 ^ bent over
40841 ^ and not able
40844 ^ to lift up herself to the full.
40935 ^ a daughter of abraham being,
40938 ^ whom has bound - satan,
40942 ^ behold, ten and eight years,
40947 ^ not ought [she]
40949 ^ to be loosed from the bond this on the day of the sabbath?
40958 ^ and these things on saying of him,
40962 ^ were ashamed
40963 ^ all those opposed to him;
40967 ^ and all the crowd was rejoicing at all the glorious things
40976 ^ that were being done by him.
40980 ^ he was saying then,
40982 ^ to what like is the kingdom - of god?
40989 ^ and to what shall i liken it?
40993 ^ like it is
40995 ^ to a grain of mustard,
41172 ^ are being cast out.
41174 ^ and they will come from east and west, and from north and south,
41185 ^ and will recline in the kingdom - of god.
41192 ^ and behold,
41194 ^ there are last
41196 ^ who will be first,
41199 ^ and there are first
41202 ^ who will be last.
41205 ^ in same the hour came near certain pharisees,
41212 ^ saying to him,
41214 ^ go out
41215 ^ and proceed from here,
41218 ^ for herod desires
41221 ^ you to kill.
41223 ^ and he said to them,
46652 ^ which for you
46655 ^ is being poured out.
46656 ^ but, behold,
46658 ^ the hand
46660 ^ of him betraying me [is] with me on the table.
46668 ^ for the son indeed
46672 ^ of man,
46674 ^ according to that having been determined goes,
46678 ^ but woe to the man that
46683 ^ by whom he is betrayed.
46686 ^ and they began
46689 ^ to question among themselves
46692 ^ - who then it might be
46696 ^ of them
46698 ^ who
46699 ^ this
46700 ^ is about
46701 ^ to do.
46702 ^ there was then also a dispute among them,
46708 ^ - which of them is thought
46712 ^ to be [the] greatest.
46714 ^ - and he said to them,
46718 ^ the kings of the gentiles rule over them,
46724 ^ and
46725 ^ those exercising authority over them, benefactors are called.
46730 ^ you however not thus [shall be].
46734 ^ instead, the greatest among you, let him be as the younger;
46743 ^ and
46744 ^ the [one] leading,
46746 ^ as the [one] serving.
46749 ^ who for [is] greater,
46752 ^ the [one] reclining
46754 ^ or the [one] serving?
46757 ^ [is] not
46758 ^ the [one] reclining?
46760 ^ i however in [the] midst of you am,
46766 ^ as the [one] serving.
46769 ^ you now are
46772 ^ those having remained with me in the trials of me.
46780 ^ and i appoint to you,
46783 ^ as appointed to me the father of me, a kingdom,
46790 ^ so that you may eat
46792 ^ and may drink at the table of me in the kingdom of me,
46802 ^ and may sit on thrones,
46806 ^ the twelve tribes judging
46810 ^ of israel.
46812 ^ simon, simon, behold,
46815 ^ - satan demanded to have
46818 ^ all of you - to sift like - wheat;
46824 ^ i however begged for you,
46829 ^ that not may fail the faith of you;
46835 ^ and you,
46837 ^ when you have turned back, strengthen the brothers of you.
46843 ^ - and he said to him,
46847 ^ lord,
46848 ^ with you ready i am both to prison and to death to go.
46859 ^ - and he said,
46862 ^ i tell you peter,
46865 ^ not will crow today [the] rooster,
46869 ^ until three times
46871 ^ me you will deny knowing.
46874 ^ and he said to them,
46877 ^ when i sent you without purse and bag and sandals,
46886 ^ not anything did you lack?
46889 ^ - and they said,
46892 ^ nothing.
46893 ^ he said then to them,
46896 ^ but now
46898 ^ the [one] having a purse, let him take [it];
46902 ^ likewise also a bag;
46905 ^ and
46906 ^ the [one] not
46908 ^ having, let him sell the cloak of him
46913 ^ and buy [one] a sword.
46916 ^ i say for to you
46919 ^ that this
46921 ^ which has been written, it behooves
46924 ^ to be accomplished in me:
46927 ^ -
46928 ^ and with the lawless he was reckoned.’
46932 ^ and for the things concerning me an end have.
46939 ^ - and they said,
46942 ^ lord, behold,
46944 ^ swords here [are]
46946 ^ two.
46947 ^ - and he said to them,
46951 ^ enough it is.
46953 ^ and
46954 ^ having gone forth, he went according to the custom to the mount - of olives;
46964 ^ followed then him also the disciples.
47599 ^ by him done.
47602 ^ he kept questioning then him in words many;
47608 ^ he however nothing answered him.
47613 ^ had been standing by now the chief priests and the scribes,
47620 ^ vehemently accusing him.
47623 ^ having set at naught then
47625 ^ him, also - herod with the troops of him,
47633 ^ and having mocked [him],
47635 ^ having put on [him] apparel splendid, sent back him to pilate.
47642 ^ became then friends - both herod and - pilate on that - day with one another;
47657 ^ previously it had been that for
47659 ^ at enmity they were between themselves.
47664 ^ pilate then,
47666 ^ having called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, said to them,
47678 ^ you brought to me the man this,
47683 ^ as misleading the people;
47687 ^ and behold,
47689 ^ i
47690 ^ before you having examined [him], nothing found in the man this
47699 ^ guilty
47700 ^ of that accusation you are bringing against him.
47704 ^ no, not even herod [did];
47707 ^ he sent back for him to us.
47712 ^ and behold,
47714 ^ nothing worthy of death is
47718 ^ done by him.
48934 ^ having.
48935 ^ and
48936 ^ this having said, he showed to them the hands and the feet.
48945 ^ still now, while they were disbelieving of them for the joy
48952 ^ and amazement,
48954 ^ he said to them,
48956 ^ have you anything to eat here?
48960 ^ - and they gave to him of a fish broiled part.
48967 ^ and
48968 ^ having taken [it], before them he ate [it].
48972 ^ he said now unto to them,
48976 ^ these [are] the words of me,
48980 ^ which i spoke to you
48984 ^ still being with you,
48988 ^ that it behooves
48990 ^ to be fulfilled all things
48992 ^ - having been written in the law of moses, and the prophets and [the] psalms concerning me.
49005 ^ then he opened their - mind
49010 ^ - to understand the scriptures.
49014 ^ and he said to them
49017 ^ -, thus it has been written:
49020 ^ was to suffer the christ,
49023 ^ and to rise out from [the] dead the third day;
49030 ^ and to be proclaimed in the name of him repentance and forgiveness of sins to all - nations,
49044 ^ having begun from jerusalem.
49047 ^ you [are] witnesses of these things.
49050 ^ and behold,
49052 ^ i am sending the promise of the father of me upon you;
49061 ^ you however remain in the city
49067 ^ until that you should be clothed with from on high power.
49073 ^ he led now them out as far as to bethany,
49080 ^ and
49081 ^ having lifted up the hands of him, he blessed them.
49087 ^ and it came to pass
49089 ^ in the blessing of him them,
49094 ^ he was separated from them
49097 ^ and was carried up into - heaven.
49102 ^ and they
49104 ^ having worshiped him, returned to jerusalem with joy great,
49112 ^ and were
49114 ^ continually all in the temple, blessing - god.
49122 ^ in [the] beginning was the word,
49127 ^ and the word was with - god,
49134 ^ and god was the word.
49139 ^ he was in [the] beginning with - god.

49158 ^ in him life was,
49162 ^ and the life was the light - of men.
49170 ^ and the light in the darkness shines,
49177 ^ and the darkness it not overcame.
49183 ^ there came a man
49185 ^ having been sent from god;
49188 ^ [the] name to him [was] john.
49191 ^ he came as a witness,
49195 ^ that he might testify concerning the light,
49200 ^ that all might believe through him.
49205 ^ not was he the light,
49210 ^ but that he might witness concerning the light.
49216 ^ was the light - true,
49221 ^ who enlightens every man,
49225 ^ coming into the world.
49229 ^ in the world he was,
49233 ^ and the world through him came into being,
49239 ^ and the world him not knew.
49245 ^ to the own he came,
49249 ^ and the own him not received.
49255 ^ as many as however received him,
49259 ^ he gave to them authority
49262 ^ children of god to be,
49265 ^ to those believing in the name of him,
49271 ^ who not of blood, nor of will of flesh, nor of will of man,
49283 ^ but of god were born.
49287 ^ and the word flesh became
49292 ^ and dwelt among us,
49296 ^ and we beheld the glory of him, a glory as of an only begotten from [the] father, full of grace and truth.
49310 ^ john witnesses concerning him,
49314 ^ and he cried out,
49316 ^ saying,

49552 ^ he it is
49554 ^ concerning whom i said,
49558 ^ after me comes a man,
49562 ^ who precedence over me has,
49566 ^ because before me he was.
49570 ^ and i not knew him;
49574 ^ but that he might be revealed - to israel,
49579 ^ because of this, came i
49583 ^ with water baptizing.
49586 ^ and bore witness john
49589 ^ saying
49590 ^ -, i have beheld the spirit,
49594 ^ descending as a dove out of heaven,
49599 ^ and it remained upon him.
49603 ^ and i not knew him;
49607 ^ but
49608 ^ the [one] having sent me
49611 ^ to baptize with water,
49614 ^ he to me said,

49675 ^ speaking,
49676 ^ and followed - jesus.

49684 ^ and having beheld them
49687 ^ following, he says to them,
49690 ^ what seek you?
49692 ^ - and they said to him,
49696 ^ rabbi
49697 ^ which is to say,
49699 ^ being translated, teacher — where are you staying?
49703 ^ he says to them,
49705 ^ come
49706 ^ and you will see.
49708 ^ they went therefore
49710 ^ and saw
49712 ^ where he abides;

50033 ^ having space for metretae two or three.
50039 ^ says to them - jesus,
50043 ^ fill the jars with water.
50047 ^ and they filled them up to [the] brim.
50052 ^ and he says to them,
50055 ^ draw out now
50057 ^ and carry to the master of the feast.
50061 ^ - and they carried [it].
50064 ^ when then had tasted the master of the feast the water
50071 ^ wine having become,
50073 ^ and not he knew
50076 ^ from where it is —
50078 ^ the however
50080 ^ servants knew

50094 ^ every man first the good wine sets out,
50101 ^ and when they might have drunk freely,
50104 ^ the inferior;
50106 ^ you have kept the good wine until now.
50113 ^ this did, [the] beginning of the signs, - jesus in cana - of galilee,
50124 ^ and he revealed the glory of him,
50129 ^ and believed in him the disciples of him.
50136 ^ after this he went down to capernaum, he
50142 ^ and the mother of him and the brothers of him and the disciples of him,
50154 ^ and there they stayed not many days.
50160 ^ and near was the passover of the jews,
50167 ^ and went up to jerusalem - jesus.
50173 ^ and he found in the temple
50178 ^ those selling oxen and sheep and doves,
50185 ^ and the money changers sitting.
50189 ^ and
50190 ^ having made a whip of cords, all he drove out from the temple,
50199 ^ - both sheep and - oxen;
50205 ^ and
50416 ^ that you do,
50419 ^ if not should be - god with him.
50426 ^ answered jesus
50428 ^ and said to him,
50431 ^ truly, truly i say to you,
50435 ^ if not anyone be born from above,
50440 ^ not he is able
50442 ^ to see the kingdom - of god.”
50447 ^ says to him - nicodemus,
50452 ^ how is able a man
50455 ^ to be born,
50456 ^ old being?
50458 ^ not is he able
50460 ^ into the womb of the mother of him a second time to enter,
50468 ^ and to be born?
50470 ^ answered jesus,
50472 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
50476 ^ if not anyone be born of water and of [the] spirit,
50484 ^ not he is able
50486 ^ to enter into the kingdom - of god.
51164 ^ a woman samaritan being?
51167 ^ not for have association jews with samaritans.
51172 ^ answered jesus
51174 ^ and said to her,
51177 ^ if you had known the gift - of god,
51183 ^ and who it is
51186 ^ - saying to you,
51189 ^ give me
51191 ^ to drink,
51192 ^ you - would have asked him,
51196 ^ and he would have given - to you water
51201 ^ living.
51202 ^ says to him the woman
51206 ^ sir, nothing to draw with you have,
51210 ^ and the well is deep;
51215 ^ from where then have you the water
51220 ^ - living?
51222 ^ not you greater than are
51226 ^ the father of us jacob,
51230 ^ who gave us the well,
51235 ^ and himself of it drank,
51240 ^ and the sons of him, and the livestock of him?
51248 ^ answered jesus
51250 ^ and said to her,
51447 ^ who worship him.
51450 ^ spirit - god [is],
51453 ^ and
51568 ^ that you not know.
51572 ^ were saying therefore the disciples to one another,
51578 ^ no one did bring him
51582 ^ [anything] to eat?
51583 ^ says to them - jesus,
51587 ^ my food is
51590 ^ that i should do the will
51594 ^ of the [one] having sent me,
51597 ^ and should finish of him the work.
51602 ^ not you say
51605 ^ that yet four months it is,
51609 ^ and the harvest comes?
51613 ^ behold,
51614 ^ i say to you,
51616 ^ lift up the eyes of you
51620 ^ and see the fields,
51624 ^ because white they are toward harvest
51629 ^ already!
51630 ^ the [one] reaping a reward receives
51634 ^ and gathers fruit unto life eternal,
51640 ^ so that
51641 ^ the [one] sowing together may rejoice,
51645 ^ and the [one] reaping.
51648 ^ in for
51650 ^ this the saying is true
51655 ^ -, one is
51658 ^ - sowing,
51660 ^ and another
51662 ^ - reaping.
51664 ^ i sent you
51667 ^ to reap
51668 ^ what not you have toiled for;
51672 ^ others have toiled,
51674 ^ and you into the labor of them have entered.
51681 ^ out of now
51683 ^ the city that, many believed in him
51690 ^ of the samaritans, because of the word of the woman
51697 ^ testifying
51698 ^ -, he told me all things
51702 ^ whatever i did.
51704 ^ when therefore came to him the samaritans,
51711 ^ they were asking him
51713 ^ to abide with them,
51716 ^ and he stayed there two days.
51721 ^ and many more believed, because of the word of him;
51729 ^ - and
51731 ^ to the woman they were saying
51733 ^ -, no longer because of - your speech we believe;
51740 ^ we ourselves for have heard,
51743 ^ and we know
51745 ^ that this is truly the savior of the world.
51753 ^ after then
51755 ^ the two days, he went forth from there into - galilee.
51763 ^ himself for
51765 ^ jesus testified
51767 ^ that a prophet in the own hometown, honor not has.
51776 ^ when therefore he came into - galilee,
51782 ^ received him the galileans,
51786 ^ all things having seen
51788 ^ how great he had done in jerusalem during the feast;
51795 ^ also themselves for they had gone to the feast.
51802 ^ he came therefore again to - cana - of galilee,
51810 ^ where he had made the water wine.
51815 ^ and there was a certain royal official
51819 ^ whose - son was sick in capernaum.
51825 ^ he,
51826 ^ having heard
51827 ^ that jesus had come out of - judea into - galilee, went to him
51839 ^ and was asking
51841 ^ that he would come down
51843 ^ and heal his - son;
51848 ^ he was about for
51850 ^ to die.
51851 ^ said therefore - jesus to him,
51857 ^ if not signs and wonders you people see,
51863 ^ no not will you believe.
51866 ^ says to him the royal official,
51871 ^ sir,
51872 ^ come down
51873 ^ before dies the child of me.
51878 ^ says to him - jesus,
51882 ^ go,
51883 ^ the son of you lives.
51887 ^ believed the man the word
51892 ^ that said to him - jesus,
51897 ^ and he went on his way.
51899 ^ already then [as] he is going down,
51903 ^ the servants of him met him,
51908 ^ saying
51909 ^ that the boy of him lives.
51914 ^ he inquired therefore the hour from them
51920 ^ in which better he got.
51924 ^ they said therefore to him
51927 ^ -, yesterday [at the] hour seventh, left him the fever.
51935 ^ knew therefore the father
51939 ^ that [it was] in that the hour
51944 ^ at which said to him - jesus,
51950 ^ the son of you lives.
51954 ^ and he believed himself,
51957 ^ and the household of him all.
51962 ^ this [is] now again [the] second sign did - jesus,
51970 ^ having come out of - judea into - galilee.
51977 ^ after these things there was a feast of the jews,
51983 ^ and went up jesus to jerusalem.
51988 ^ there is now in - jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool,
51997 ^ - called in hebrew bethesda,
52001 ^ five porches having.
52004 ^ in these were lying a multitude
52008 ^ of those ailing, blind, lame, paralyzed.
52013 ^ was now a certain man there,
52018 ^ thirty and eight years being in - infirmity himself.
52027 ^ him having seen - jesus
52031 ^ lying,
52032 ^ and having known
52034 ^ that a long already
52037 ^ time he has been, he says to him,
52041 ^ desire you
52042 ^ well to become?
52044 ^ answered him
52046 ^ the [one] ailing,
52048 ^ sir, a man not i have,
52052 ^ that when has been stirred the water,
52057 ^ he might put me into the pool,
52274 ^ anything he might see
52276 ^ the father
52278 ^ doing;
52279 ^ whatever for - he does,
52284 ^ these things also the son likewise does.
52290 ^ - for
52292 ^ the father loves the son,
52296 ^ and all things shows to him
52300 ^ that he does;
52303 ^ and greater than these he will show him
52308 ^ works,
52309 ^ so that you may marvel.
52312 ^ even as for the father raises up the dead
52319 ^ and gives life,
52321 ^ thus also the son
52325 ^ to whom he will, gives life.
52328 ^ not even for the father judges no one,
52334 ^ but - judgment all has given to the son,
52341 ^ so that all may honor the son,
52346 ^ even as they honor the father.
52438 ^ judgment to execute,
52440 ^ because son of man he is.
52444 ^ not marvel at this,
52447 ^ for is coming an hour
52450 ^ in which all those in the tombs will hear the voice of him,
52461 ^ and will come forth —
52463 ^ those - good
52466 ^ having done, to [the] resurrection of life;
52881 ^ who has five loaves barley and two small fish;
52889 ^ but these what are for so many?
52895 ^ said - jesus,
52898 ^ make the men
52901 ^ to recline.
52902 ^ there was now grass much in the place.
52909 ^ reclined therefore the men, the number about five thousand.
52917 ^ took then the loaves - jesus,
52923 ^ and
52924 ^ having given thanks, he distributed
52926 ^ to those reclining;
52928 ^ likewise also
52930 ^ of the fish, as much as they wished.
52935 ^ when now they were filled,
52938 ^ he says to the disciples of him,
52942 ^ gather together the
52944 ^ having been over and above fragments,
52946 ^ so that nothing anything may be lost.
52950 ^ they gathered together therefore,
52952 ^ and filled twelve hand-baskets of fragments from the five loaves - barley
52963 ^ which were over and above
52965 ^ to those having eaten.
52967 ^ the therefore
52969 ^ people,
52970 ^ having seen
52971 ^ what he had done, [the] sign, were saying
52975 ^ -, this is truly the prophet
52981 ^ who is coming into the world.
52986 ^ jesus therefore,
52988 ^ having known
52989 ^ that they are about
52991 ^ to come
52992 ^ and to seize him
52995 ^ that they might make [him] king, withdrew again to the mountain
53003 ^ himself alone.
53005 ^ when now evening it became,
53009 ^ went down the disciples of him to the sea,
53016 ^ and
53017 ^ having entered into a boat, they were going over the sea to capernaum.
53026 ^ and dark already it had become,
53030 ^ and not had come to them - jesus.
53037 ^ - and
53039 ^ the sea
53040 ^ by a wind strong blowing was agitated.
53660 ^ that i will give, the flesh of me is
53667 ^ for the of the world life.
53672 ^ were arguing therefore with one another the jews,
53678 ^ saying,
53679 ^ how is able this [man]
53682 ^ us to give the flesh of him to eat?
53688 ^ said therefore to them - jesus,
53693 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
53697 ^ if not you shall have eaten the flesh of the son - of man,
53706 ^ and shall have drunk of him the blood,
53711 ^ not you have life in yourselves.
53716 ^ the [one] eating of me the flesh,
53721 ^ and drinking of me the blood, has life eternal,
53729 ^ and i will raise up him in the last day.
53735 ^ the for
53737 ^ flesh of me, true is
53741 ^ food,
53742 ^ and the blood of me, true is
53748 ^ drink.
53749 ^ the [one] eating of me the flesh
53754 ^ and drinking of me the blood, in me abides,
53762 ^ and i in him.
53765 ^ as sent me the
53769 ^ living father,
53771 ^ and i live because of the father,
53776 ^ also
53777 ^ the [one] feeding on me,
53780 ^ he also will live because of me.
53784 ^ this is the bread
53788 ^ - from heaven
53791 ^ having come down,
53792 ^ not as ate the fathers
53797 ^ and died.
56350 ^ who had been blind,
56353 ^ and said to him,
56356 ^ give glory - to god!
56360 ^ we know
56362 ^ that this - man a sinner is.
56368 ^ answered then he,
56371 ^ whether a sinner he is,
56374 ^ not i know.
56376 ^ one [thing] i do know,
56378 ^ that
56379 ^ blind being, now i see.
56383 ^ they said therefore to him,
56386 ^ what did he to you?
56389 ^ how opened he of you the eyes?
56394 ^ he answered them,
56396 ^ i told you already,
56399 ^ and not you did listen.
56402 ^ why
56403 ^ again do you wish to hear?
56406 ^ not also you do wish
56410 ^ his disciples to become?
56413 ^ and they railed at him
56416 ^ and said,
56418 ^ you a disciple are
56421 ^ of that one;
56422 ^ we however - of moses are
56427 ^ disciples.
56428 ^ we know
56430 ^ that to moses has spoken - god;
56435 ^ this [man] however not we know
56439 ^ from where is.
56441 ^ answered the man
56444 ^ and said to them,
56447 ^ in this for - an amazing thing is,
56453 ^ that you not know
56457 ^ from where he is,
56459 ^ and yet he opened my - eyes.
56464 ^ we know
56465 ^ that sinners - god not does hear;
56471 ^ but if anyone god-fearing is,
56476 ^ and the will of him does,
56481 ^ him he hears.
56483 ^ out of the age never it has been heard,
56488 ^ that opened anyone [the] eyes of [one] blind
56493 ^ having been born.
56494 ^ if not were this [man] from god,
56500 ^ not he could
56502 ^ do nothing.
56504 ^ they answered
56505 ^ and said to him,
56508 ^ in sins you were born entirely,
56513 ^ and you teach us?
56517 ^ and they cast him out.
56521 ^ heard jesus
56523 ^ that they had cast him out,
56527 ^ and
56528 ^ having found him, he said,
56531 ^ you believe in the son of man?”
56538 ^ answered he
56540 ^ and said,
56542 ^ and who is he, lord,
56546 ^ that i may believe in him?
56550 ^ said to him - jesus,
56554 ^ both you have seen him,
56557 ^ and
56558 ^ the [one] speaking with you he is.
56564 ^ - and he was saying,
56567 ^ i believe, lord.
56569 ^ and he worshiped him.
56572 ^ and said - jesus,
56576 ^ for judgment i into the world this came,
56584 ^ that
56585 ^ those not
56587 ^ seeing may see;
56589 ^ and
56590 ^ those seeing, blind may become.”
56594 ^ heard of the pharisees these things,
56599 ^ who with him
56602 ^ were,
56603 ^ and they said to him,
56606 ^ not also we blind are?
56611 ^ said to them - jesus,
56615 ^ if blind you were,
56618 ^ not - you would have sin;
56622 ^ since however you say
56625 ^ -, we see,
56627 ^ the sin of you remains.
56631 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
56635 ^ the [one] not
56637 ^ entering in by the door to the fold of the sheep,
56646 ^ but climbing up another way,
56649 ^ he a thief is
56652 ^ and a robber.
56826 ^ whose not are the sheep
56831 ^ own, sees the wolf
56835 ^ coming,
56836 ^ and leaves the sheep,
56840 ^ and flees —
56842 ^ and the wolf snatches them
56847 ^ and scatters —
56849 ^ because a hired servant he is,
56852 ^ and not is himself concerned to him about the sheep.
56859 ^ i am the shepherd - good;
56865 ^ and i know - my own,
56869 ^ and am known i by mine.
56874 ^ as knows me the father,
56879 ^ i also know the father;
56883 ^ and the life of me i lay down for the sheep.
56891 ^ and other sheep i have,
56895 ^ which not are of the fold this;
56946 ^ to lay down it,
56948 ^ and authority i have
56951 ^ again to take it.
56954 ^ this - commandment i received from the father of me.
56962 ^ division again there was among the jews on account of the words these.
56972 ^ were saying now many of them,
56977 ^ a demon he has,
56979 ^ and is insane;
56981 ^ why him do you listen to?
56984 ^ others were saying,
56986 ^ these - sayings not are [those]
57313 ^ that said john about this [man], true was.
57320 ^ and many believed in him there.
57326 ^ was now a certain [man]
60835 ^ that no other has done,
60839 ^ sin not they would have had;
60842 ^ now however both they have seen
60846 ^ and have hated both me and the father of me.
60854 ^ but [this is] that may be fulfilled the word
60859 ^ - in the law of them
60864 ^ having been written
60865 ^ -: they hated me without cause.’
60869 ^ when comes the helper,
60873 ^ whom i will send to you from the father, the spirit - of truth,
60884 ^ who from the father goes forth,
60889 ^ he will bear witness concerning me.
60893 ^ also you now bear witness,
60897 ^ because from [the] beginning with me you are.
60903 ^ these things i have spoken to you
60906 ^ that not you might fall away.
60909 ^ out of the synagogues they will put you;
60912 ^ but is coming an hour
60915 ^ that
60916 ^ everyone - having killed you will think
60921 ^ [it is] a service to offer - to god.
60925 ^ and these things they will do,
60928 ^ because not they know the father, nor me.
60935 ^ but these things i have said to you,
60939 ^ so that when might have come the hour of them,
60945 ^ you may remember them,
60947 ^ that i said [them] to you.
60951 ^ these things now to you from [the] beginning not i said,
60958 ^ because with you i was.
60962 ^ now however i go
60965 ^ to the [one] having sent me,
60969 ^ and none of you asks me,
60975 ^ where are you going?
60977 ^ but because these things i have said to you,
60982 ^ - sorrow has filled your - heart.
60988 ^ but i the truth say to you,
60994 ^ it is profitable for you
60996 ^ that i should go away.
60999 ^ if for not i go away,
61003 ^ the helper no will come to you;
61009 ^ if however i go,
61012 ^ i will send him to you.
61016 ^ and
61017 ^ having come, he will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment:
61030 ^ concerning sin indeed,
61033 ^ because not do they believe in me;
61038 ^ concerning righteousness now,
61041 ^ because to the father i go away,
61046 ^ and no more you behold me;
61050 ^ concerning now
61052 ^ judgment,
61053 ^ because the ruler of the world this has been judged.
61060 ^ yet
61061 ^ many things i have to you to say,
61065 ^ but not you are able
61068 ^ to bear them now.
61070 ^ when however shall come he, the spirit - of truth,
61078 ^ he will guide you into the truth all;
61084 ^ not for he will speak from himself,
61089 ^ but
61090 ^ whatever he may hear, he will speak;
61093 ^ and
61094 ^ the things coming he will declare to you.
61098 ^ he me will glorify,
61101 ^ for from that which [is] mine he will take,
61106 ^ and will disclose to you.
61109 ^ all things
61110 ^ whatever has the father, mine are;
61116 ^ because of this, i said
61119 ^ that from that which [is] mine he will take
61124 ^ and will disclose to you.
61127 ^ a little [while]
61128 ^ and no longer you do behold me;
61132 ^ and again a little [while]
61135 ^ and you will see me.”
61138 ^ said therefore [some] of the disciples of him to one another,
61146 ^ what is this
61149 ^ that he says to us,
61152 ^ a little [while]
61153 ^ and not you do behold me;
61157 ^ and, again a little [while]
61160 ^ and you will see me’
61163 ^ and because i am going to the father’?
61169 ^ they were saying therefore,
61171 ^ what is this
61174 ^ that he says,
61176 ^ a little [while]’?
61178 ^ not we do know
61180 ^ what he is saying.
61182 ^ knew - jesus
61185 ^ that they were desiring
61187 ^ him to ask,
61189 ^ and he said to them,
61192 ^ concerning this do you inquire among one another
61197 ^ that i said,
61199 ^ a little [while]
61200 ^ and not you do behold me,
61204 ^ and again a little [while]
61207 ^ and you will see me’?
61210 ^ truly, truly, i say to you
61214 ^ that will weep
61216 ^ and will lament you,
61219 ^ - but
61221 ^ the world will rejoice.
61223 ^ you will be grieved,
61225 ^ but the grief of you to joy will turn.
61232 ^ the woman
61234 ^ when she is giving birth,
61236 ^ pain has,
61238 ^ because has come the hour of her;
61243 ^ when however she brings forth the child,
61248 ^ no longer she remembers the tribulation, on account of the joy
61255 ^ that has been born a man into the world.
61261 ^ also you therefore, now indeed grief have;
61268 ^ again however i will see you,
61272 ^ and will rejoice your - heart,
61277 ^ and the joy of you no one will take from you.
61285 ^ and in that - day, of me not you will ask nothing.
61294 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
62423 ^ bound, to caiaphas the high priest.
62428 ^ was now simon peter
62432 ^ standing
62433 ^ and warming himself.
62435 ^ they said therefore to him,
62438 ^ not also you of the disciples of him are?
62446 ^ denied he
62448 ^ and said,
62450 ^ not i am.
62452 ^ says one of the servants of the high priest,
62459 ^ kinsman being [of him]
62461 ^ of whom had cut off peter
62464 ^ the ear,
62466 ^ not i you saw
62470 ^ in the garden with him?
62475 ^ again then denied peter,
62479 ^ and immediately a rooster crowed.
62483 ^ they are leading then - jesus from - caiaphas into the praetorium.
62493 ^ it was now early,
62496 ^ and they not entered into the praetorium
62503 ^ so that not they should be defiled,
62506 ^ but might eat the passover.
62510 ^ went therefore - pilate out to them
62517 ^ and said,
62519 ^ what accusation bring you against the man this?
62526 ^ they answered
62527 ^ and said to him,
62530 ^ if not were he
62534 ^ evil doing,
62536 ^ not - to you we would have delivered him.
62541 ^ said therefore to them - pilate,
62546 ^ take him yourselves
62549 ^ and according to the law of you judge him.
62556 ^ said to him the jews,
62560 ^ to us not it is permitted
62563 ^ to put to death no one
62565 ^ that the word - of jesus might be fulfilled,
62571 ^ which he had spoken,
62573 ^ signifying
62943 ^ to release you,
62945 ^ and authority i have
62948 ^ to crucify you?
62950 ^ answered him jesus,
62953 ^ not you would have authority also me
62958 ^ against,
62959 ^ if not it were
62962 ^ given to you from above.
62965 ^ because of this,
62967 ^ the [one] having delivered up me to you, greater sin has.
62974 ^ out of this - pilate was seeking
62979 ^ to release him;
62981 ^ - but
62983 ^ the jews cried out,
62985 ^ saying,
62986 ^ if this [man] you release,
62989 ^ not you are a friend - of caesar.
63229 ^ that said:
63231 ^ they divided the garments of me among them,
63236 ^ and for the clothing of me they cast a lot.”
63243 ^ the indeed therefore
63246 ^ soldiers these things did.
63249 ^ had been standing now by the cross - of jesus the mother of him, and the sister of the mother of him, mary the [wife] - of clopas, and mary - magdalene.
63273 ^ jesus therefore,
63275 ^ having seen [his] mother and the disciple
63281 ^ standing by
63282 ^ whom he loved,
63284 ^ says to [his] mother,
63287 ^ woman, behold,
63289 ^ the son of you.
63292 ^ then he says to the disciple,
63296 ^ behold
63297 ^ the mother of you.
63300 ^ and from that - hour took the disciple her to the own.
63312 ^ after this,
63314 ^ knowing - jesus
63317 ^ that now all things had been accomplished,
63321 ^ so that might be fulfilled the scripture, he says,
63326 ^ i thirst.
63327 ^ a vessel had been set [there]
63329 ^ of sour wine full;
63555 ^ to prepare for burial.
63556 ^ there was now in the place
63561 ^ where he was crucified a garden,
63564 ^ and in the garden a tomb new,
64762 ^ which began - jesus
64766 ^ to do both
64768 ^ and to teach,
64770 ^ until the day,
64773 ^ having given orders to the apostles by [the] spirit holy
64779 ^ whom he had chosen, he was taken up,
64782 ^ to whom also he presented himself
64786 ^ alive
64787 ^ after the suffering of him with many proofs,
64794 ^ during days forty being seen by them
64799 ^ and speaking the things concerning the kingdom - of god.
64807 ^ and
64808 ^ being assembled together, he instructed them
64811 ^ from jerusalem not to depart,
64815 ^ but to await the promise of the father:
64821 ^ that which you heard of me;
64824 ^ for john indeed baptized with water;
64829 ^ you however with [the] spirit will be baptized
64834 ^ holy, not after many these days.
64840 ^ those indeed therefore
64843 ^ having come together, were asking him,
64846 ^ saying,
64847 ^ lord, if at the time this, are you restoring the kingdom - to israel?
64858 ^ he said then to them,
64862 ^ not yours it is
64865 ^ to know times or seasons
64869 ^ which the father put in place by - his own authority.
64877 ^ but you will receive power,
64880 ^ having come the holy spirit upon you,
64886 ^ and you will be for me witnesses, in both jerusalem, and in all - judea, and samaria, and to [the] uttermost part of the earth.
64905 ^ and
64906 ^ these things having said,
64908 ^ beholding they, he was taken up,
64911 ^ and a cloud hid him from the eyes of them.
64919 ^ and as
64921 ^ looking intently they were into the heaven
64926 ^ as was going he,
64928 ^ then behold
64930 ^ men two stood by them
64934 ^ in apparel white,
64937 ^ who also said,
64940 ^ men, galileans, why do you stand
64944 ^ looking into - heaven?
64948 ^ this - jesus,
64951 ^ - having been taken up from you into - heaven, thus will come
64960 ^ in that manner you beheld him
64964 ^ going into - heaven.
64968 ^ then they returned to jerusalem from [the] mount
64974 ^ - called olivet,
64977 ^ which is near jerusalem,
64981 ^ a sabbath day’s holding
64983 ^ journey.
64984 ^ and when they had entered into the upper room,
64990 ^ they went up
66435 ^ [that] should suffer the christ of him, he has fulfilled thus.
66441 ^ repent, therefore,
66443 ^ and turn again,
66445 ^ for the blotting out of your - sins,
66451 ^ so that - may come times of refreshing from [the] presence of the lord,
66460 ^ and [that] he may send the [one]
66463 ^ having been appointed to you, christ jesus,
67261 ^ which is
67263 ^ translated son of encouragement a levite, a cypriot at the birth,
67270 ^ owns by him a field,
67273 ^ having sold [it], brought the money
67277 ^ and laid [it] at the feet of the apostles.
67284 ^ a man now
67286 ^ certain, ananias named, with sapphira, the wife of him, sold a property,
67296 ^ and he kept back from the proceeds,
67301 ^ being aware of [it] also the wife,
67305 ^ and
67306 ^ having brought a portion certain, at the feet of the apostles he laid [it].
67315 ^ said however - peter,
67319 ^ ananias, because of why has filled - satan the heart of you
67328 ^ to lie to [for] you the spirit - holy
67334 ^ and to keep back from the proceeds of the land?
67341 ^ not
67342 ^ remaining to you did it remain?
67345 ^ and
67346 ^ having been sold, in the own authority it was?
67352 ^ why
67353 ^ - did you purpose in the heart of you the deed this?
67362 ^ not you have lied to men,
67365 ^ but - to god!
67673 ^ having come, [the] officers not did find them in the prison;
68808 ^ following day, he appeared to those who
68812 ^ were quarreling
68813 ^ and urged them to peace,
68818 ^ having said,
68819 ^ men, brothers you are.
68822 ^ so that why wrong you one another?
69825 ^ in for
69827 ^ [the] gall of bitterness and [the] bond of iniquity, i see
69833 ^ you
69834 ^ being.
70384 ^ to bind
70385 ^ all those calling on the name of you.
70391 ^ said however to him the lord,
70397 ^ go,
70398 ^ for a vessel of choice is
70402 ^ to me this [man],
70404 ^ - to carry the name of me before [the] gentiles, and also kings, [the] sons then of israel;
70417 ^ i for will show to him
72957 ^ - also [called] paul,
72960 ^ having been filled [the] spirit holy,
72963 ^ having looked intently upon him, said,
72967 ^ o full of all deceit and all craft, son of [the] devil, enemy of all righteousness, not will you cease
72981 ^ perverting the ways the of lord - straight?
72988 ^ and now behold,
72991 ^ [the] hand of the lord [is] upon you,
72995 ^ and you will be blind,
72998 ^ not seeing the sun during a season.
73004 ^ immediately then fell upon him mist and darkness,
73012 ^ and
73013 ^ going about he was seeking someone to lead [him] by the hand.
73016 ^ then
73017 ^ having seen the proconsul
73269 ^ of whom not i am
73272 ^ worthy
73273 ^ a sandal of the feet to untie.
73278 ^ men, brothers, sons of [the] family of abraham, and those among you
73287 ^ fearing - god, to us the message of the salvation this has been sent.
73297 ^ those for
73299 ^ dwelling in jerusalem and the rulers of them,
73306 ^ him not having known,
73308 ^ and the voices of the prophets
73313 ^ that on every sabbath
73317 ^ are being read,
73318 ^ having condemned [him] they fulfilled [them].
73320 ^ and
73321 ^ no cause of death having found, they begged pilate
73327 ^ to put to death him.
73329 ^ when then they had finished
73332 ^ all the things about him
73336 ^ having been written,
73574 ^ coming sabbath, almost all the city was gathered together
73581 ^ to hear the word - of the lord.
73759 ^ unbelieving jews stirred up
73762 ^ and poisoned the minds of the gentiles against the brothers.
73771 ^ a long indeed therefore
73774 ^ time they stayed,
73776 ^ speaking boldly for the lord,
73780 ^ the [one] bearing witness to the word of the grace of him,
73788 ^ granting
73789 ^ signs and wonders to be done through the hands of them.
73797 ^ was divided now the multitude of the city,
73803 ^ and some indeed were with the jews;
73810 ^ some however with the apostles.
73815 ^ when then there was a rush of the gentiles both and jews, with the rulers of them,
73828 ^ to mistreat
73829 ^ and to stone them,
73977 ^ with you men,
73979 ^ proclaiming the gospel to you,
73981 ^ from these - vanities to turn to god
73988 ^ [the] living,
73989 ^ who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them,
74004 ^ who in the
74007 ^ past generations allowed all the nations
74013 ^ to go the ways of them.
74017 ^ and yet not without witness himself he has left,
74022 ^ doing good, from heaven to you
74025 ^ rains giving
74027 ^ and seasons fruitful,
74030 ^ filling with food and gladness the hearts of you.
74037 ^ and
74038 ^ these things saying, hardly they stopped the crowds
74044 ^ - not
74046 ^ sacrificing to them.
74048 ^ came however from antioch and iconium jews,
74055 ^ and
74056 ^ having persuaded the crowds,
74059 ^ and having stoned - paul, they dragged [him] outside the city,
74067 ^ supposing
74068 ^ him to have died.
74070 ^ having surrounded however the disciples him,
75691 ^ worshipping greeks a multitude great, women then
75697 ^ of the leading not a few.
75701 ^ having become jealous now the jews,
75705 ^ and having taken to [them] of the market-loungers men certain wicked,
75712 ^ and having collected a crowd, they set in uproar the city;
75717 ^ and
75718 ^ having assailed the house of jason, they were seeking
75723 ^ them to bring out to the people.
76017 ^ strange things for
76019 ^ some you are bringing to the ears of us.
76025 ^ we resolve therefore
76027 ^ to know
76982 ^ not - being ordinary, - god was performing by the hands of paul,
76992 ^ so that even
76994 ^ to the ailing were brought from the skin of him handkerchiefs or aprons,
77005 ^ and departed from them the diseases,
77011 ^ the also
77013 ^ spirits - evil left.
77017 ^ attempted now some of also
77021 ^ of the
77022 ^ itinerant jews, exorcists,
77025 ^ to invoke
77026 ^ over those having - spirits - evil the name of the lord jesus,
77038 ^ saying,
77039 ^ i adjure you [by] jesus
77043 ^ whom paul proclaims.
77046 ^ they were now certain of sceva, a jew, a high priest, seven sons,
77054 ^ this were doing.
77082 ^ in whom was the spirit - evil,
77089 ^ having overpowered them all, he prevailed against them
77094 ^ so that naked
77096 ^ and wounded they fled out of the house that.
77103 ^ this now became known to all jews both and greeks,
77112 ^ those inhabiting - ephesus;
77116 ^ and fell fear upon all them,
77122 ^ and was being magnified the name of the lord jesus.
77129 ^ many then
79811 ^ the following night,
79813 ^ having stood by him, the lord said,
79818 ^ take courage,
79819 ^ as for you have fully testified - about me at jerusalem,
79909 ^ - to kill him.
80376 ^ of which we accuse him.
80380 ^ agreed then also the jews,
80385 ^ declaring
80386 ^ these things so to be.
80389 ^ answered then - paul,
80393 ^ having made a sign to him the governor
80397 ^ to speak:
80431 ^ in the temple did they find
80435 ^ me
80436 ^ with anyone reasoning,
80439 ^ or
80440 ^ a tumultuous gathering making
80442 ^ of a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city.
80451 ^ nor
80452 ^ to prove are they able to you,
80455 ^ concerning [the things] of which now they accuse me.
80460 ^ i confess however this to you,
80464 ^ that according to the way
80468 ^ which they call a sect,
80471 ^ so i serve the of our fathers god,
80476 ^ believing all things - throughout the law,
80482 ^ and that in the prophets
80487 ^ have been written,
80488 ^ a hope having in - god
80493 ^ which also they themselves await,
80498 ^ [that] a resurrection there is about
80500 ^ to be
80501 ^ of [the] just both and of [the] unjust.
80505 ^ in this also i myself strive,
80510 ^ without offense a conscience to have toward - god and - men, through everything.
80521 ^ after years now
80524 ^ many,
80525 ^ alms to bring to the nation of me, i arrived,
80532 ^ and offerings,
80534 ^ during which they found me
80538 ^ purified in the temple, not with a crowd, nor in tumult.
80548 ^ some however [are]
80550 ^ from - asia, jews
80554 ^ who ought
80556 ^ before you to appear
80559 ^ and to make accusation,
80561 ^ if anything they may have against me.
80566 ^ otherwise themselves it let them say
80570 ^ any they found
80572 ^ unrighteousness,
80573 ^ having stood in me before the council,
80578 ^ [other] than concerning one this voice
80583 ^ which i cried out
80585 ^ among them standing
80588 ^ -: concerning [the] resurrection of [the] dead i am judged this day by you.
80597 ^ put off however them - felix,
80602 ^ more precisely having knowledge of the things concerning the way,
80608 ^ having said,
80609 ^ when lysias the commander might have come down,
80614 ^ i will examine the things as to you,
80923 ^ of which they [can] accuse me,
80927 ^ no one
80928 ^ me can to them give up.
80932 ^ to caesar i appeal!
80934 ^ then - festus,
80937 ^ having conferred with the council, answered,
80942 ^ to caesar you have appealed;
80944 ^ to caesar you will go!
80947 ^ days now having passed
80950 ^ some,
80951 ^ agrippa the king and bernice came down to caesarea,
80959 ^ greeting - festus.
80962 ^ as now many days they stayed there,
80968 ^ - festus, the king laid before, the things relating to - paul,
80977 ^ saying,
80978 ^ a man certain there is
80981 ^ left by felix [as] a prisoner,
80985 ^ concerning whom,
80987 ^ having been my in jerusalem, made a presentation the chief priests and the elders of the jews,
80999 ^ asking against him judgment,
81003 ^ to whom i answered
81006 ^ that not it is [the] custom with romans
81011 ^ to give up any man
81014 ^ before that
81016 ^ the [one] being accused to face may have [it] the accusers
81023 ^ [the] opportunity, and
81025 ^ of defense he may have concerning the accusation.
81030 ^ having come together therefore of them here,
82959 ^ the nation of me
82962 ^ having
82963 ^ anything
82964 ^ to lay against.
82965 ^ for this therefore
82968 ^ - cause i have called
82971 ^ you, to see
82973 ^ and to speak to [you];
82975 ^ because of for
82977 ^ the hope - of israel, the chain this i have around [me].
82985 ^ - and to him they said,
82990 ^ we neither letters concerning you received from - judea,
82999 ^ nor
83000 ^ having arrived any of the brothers reported
83005 ^ or said anything concerning you evil.
83011 ^ we deem it worthy however
83013 ^ from you to hear
83016 ^ what you think,
83018 ^ concerning truly for
83021 ^ the sect this, known to us it is
83027 ^ that everywhere it is spoken against.
84406 ^ to shed blood;
84408 ^ ruin and misery [are] in the paths of them;
84415 ^ and [the] way of peace not they have known.
84420 ^ not there is fear of god before the eyes of them.”
84428 ^ we know now
84430 ^ that
84431 ^ whatever the law says, to those under the law it speaks,
84440 ^ so that every mouth may be stopped,
84444 ^ and under judgment may be all the world - to god.
84452 ^ therefore by works of [the] law not will be justified any flesh before him;
84462 ^ through for
84464 ^ [the] law [is] knowledge of sin.
84467 ^ now however, apart from law, [the] righteousness of god has been revealed,
84474 ^ being borne witness to by the law and the prophets,
84481 ^ [the] righteousness now
84483 ^ of god through faith from jesus christ
84488 ^ toward all those believing.
84492 ^ not for there is distinction.
84496 ^ all for have sinned
84499 ^ and fall short of the glory - of god,
84505 ^ being justified freely by the of him grace through the redemption that [is] in christ jesus,
84517 ^ whom set forth as - god a propitiation, through - faith in - his blood, for a showing forth of the righteousness of him, because of the forbearance of the
84538 ^ having taken place beforehand sins — in the forbearance - of god;
84545 ^ for of [the] showing forth the righteousness of him in the present time,
84555 ^ for - to be him just and
84561 ^ justifying the [one] of faith of jesus.
84566 ^ where then [is] the boasting?
84570 ^ it has been excluded.
84571 ^ through what principle?
84574 ^ that of works?
84576 ^ no,
84577 ^ but through [the] principle of faith.
84581 ^ we reckon therefore
84583 ^ to be justified by faith a man, apart from works of the law.
84589 ^ or of jews [is he] the god only,
84594 ^ not also of gentiles?
84597 ^ yes, also of gentiles,
84600 ^ since indeed one - god [is],
84604 ^ who will justify [the] circumcision by faith
84609 ^ and [the] uncircumcision through the [same] faith.
84614 ^ law then do we nullify through - faith?
84620 ^ never may it be!
84622 ^ instead, law we uphold.
86238 ^ warring against the law of the mind of me,
86244 ^ and making captive me to the law - of sin,
86252 ^ - being in the members of me.
86258 ^ o wretched i am
86260 ^ man!
86261 ^ who me will deliver out of the body - of death this?
86270 ^ thanks [be] then to god, through jesus christ the lord of us!
86280 ^ then so, myself i with the indeed
86286 ^ mind serve law god’s,
86290 ^ - but [with]
86292 ^ the flesh [the] law of sin.
86295 ^ [there is] no therefore now
86298 ^ condemnation to those in christ jesus.
86303 ^ - for
86305 ^ the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has set free you from the law - of sin and - of death.
86323 ^ - for
86325 ^ powerless [being] the law,
86328 ^ in that it was weak through the flesh,
86334 ^ - god,
86336 ^ - of himself son having sent, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, condemned - sin in the flesh,
86353 ^ so that the righteousness of the law should be fulfilled in us
86361 ^ - not according to the flesh
86365 ^ walking,
86366 ^ but according to [the] spirit.
86687 ^ being seen, not is hope;
86757 ^ to those according to [his] purpose called
86761 ^ being.
86762 ^ for those whom he foreknew,
86765 ^ also he predestined [to be] conformed to the image of the son of him,
86773 ^ for - to be him firstborn among many brothers.
86781 ^ those whom then he predestined,
86784 ^ these also he called;
86787 ^ and whom he called,
86790 ^ these also he justified;
86793 ^ whom then he justified,
86796 ^ these also he glorified.
86799 ^ what then will we say to these things?
86804 ^ if - god [is] for us,
86809 ^ who [can be] against us?
86812 ^ he who indeed the own son not spared,
86819 ^ but for us all gave up him,
86825 ^ how not also with him, things all us will he grant?
86834 ^ who will bring an accusation against [the] elect of god?
86839 ^ god [is]
86840 ^ the [one] justifying.
86842 ^ who [is]
86843 ^ the [one] condemning?
86845 ^ [for it is] christ jesus,
86847 ^ the [one] having died,
86849 ^ rather now having been raised up,
86852 ^ who also is at [the] right hand - of god,
86859 ^ who and is interceding for us.
86864 ^ who us will separate from the love - of christ?
86872 ^ tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?
86885 ^ as it has been written
86887 ^ -: for the sake of you, we face death all the day;
86894 ^ we were regarded as sheep of slaughter.”
86898 ^ but in these things all, we more than conquer
86903 ^ through the [one] having loved us.
86907 ^ i am persuaded for
86909 ^ that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,
86918 ^ nor things present,
86920 ^ nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any created thing other, will be able
86933 ^ us to separate from the love - of god - in christ jesus the lord of us.
86947 ^ [the] truth i speak in christ.
86951 ^ not i am lying,
86953 ^ bearing witness with me the conscience of me in [the] spirit holy,
86961 ^ that grief to me is great,
86966 ^ and unceasing sorrow in the heart of me.
86972 ^ could wish for
86974 ^ a curse to be myself i, separated from - christ for the brothers of me, - kinsmen of me, according to [the] flesh;
86990 ^ who are israelites,
86993 ^ whose [is] the divine adoption as sons, and the glory, and the covenants, and the lawgiving, and the service, and the promises;
87011 ^ whose [are] the patriarchs;
87014 ^ and from whom [is] - christ - according to the flesh,
87022 ^ - being over all god,
87027 ^ blessed to the ages. amen.
87032 ^ [it is] not as however,
87035 ^ that has failed the word - of god.
87041 ^ not for all who [are] of israel,
87047 ^ [are] these israel.
87049 ^ nor because they are seed of abraham
87054 ^ [are] all children;
87056 ^ rather, in isaac will be named to you offspring”
87062 ^ that is, not the children of the flesh,
87069 ^ these [are] children - of god;
87073 ^ but the children of the promise are regarded as offspring.
87081 ^ of [the] promise for,
87083 ^ the word [is] this:
87086 ^ at the time this, i will come,
87091 ^ and there will be - to sarah a son.”
87096 ^ not only then,
87099 ^ but also rebecca,
87102 ^ by one conception, having
87106 ^ isaac the father of us,
87110 ^ not yet for having been born,
87113 ^ nor having done anything good or evil,
87119 ^ so that the according to election purpose - of god might stand, not of works,
87130 ^ but of the [one] calling,
87134 ^ it was said to her
87136 ^ -, the older will serve the younger.”
87142 ^ as it has been written
87144 ^ -: jacob i loved,
87147 ^ - but
87149 ^ esau i hated.”
87151 ^ what then shall we say?
87154 ^ not injustice with - god [is there]?
87159 ^ never may it be!
87161 ^ to moses for he says:
87165 ^ i will show mercy to
87166 ^ whom - i may show mercy,
87169 ^ and i will have compassion on
87171 ^ whom - i may have compassion.”
87174 ^ so then, [it is] not
87177 ^ of the willing,
87179 ^ nor of the running, but -
87184 ^ showing mercy of god.
87186 ^ says for the scripture to pharaoh
87192 ^ -: for this very therefore i have raised up you,
87198 ^ so that i might show in you the power of me,
87205 ^ and that should be declared the name of me in all the earth.”
87215 ^ so then,
87217 ^ to whom he wants, he shows mercy;
87243 ^ - answering against - god?
87247 ^ not will say the thing formed
87251 ^ to the [one] having formed [it],
87253 ^ why me have you made like this?”
87257 ^ or not has authority the potter
87263 ^ over the clay,
87265 ^ out of the same lump to make
87270 ^ one indeed unto honor vessel,
87275 ^ one however unto dishonor?
87279 ^ what if now
87281 ^ desiring - god
87284 ^ to show the wrath
87287 ^ and to make known the power of him, bore with much patience, [the] vessels of wrath,
87298 ^ having been fitted for destruction,
87301 ^ also that he might make known the riches of the glory of him upon [the] vessels of mercy,
87312 ^ which he prepared beforehand for glory,
87316 ^ whom even he has called,
87319 ^ us not only out from [the] jews, but also out from [the] gentiles?
87328 ^ as also in - hosea he says:
87334 ^ i will call that which [is] not people
87338 ^ of me, people of me;
87341 ^ and
87342 ^ her not having been loved,
87345 ^ having been loved,”
87346 ^ and, it will happen that in the place
87351 ^ where it was said to them,
87354 ^ not people my [are] you,
87358 ^ there they will be called sons of god
87362 ^ [the] living.’”
87363 ^ isaiah also cries out concerning - israel:
87369 ^ though shall be the number of the sons of israel as the sand of the sea,
87381 ^ [only] the remnant will be saved.
87384 ^ [the] sentence for
87386 ^ concluding
87387 ^ and bringing swiftly, will perform [the] lord upon the earth.”
87394 ^ and, as foretold isaiah:
87398 ^ if not [the] lord of hosts had left us descendants,
87405 ^ like sodom - we would have become,
87409 ^ and like gomorrah - we would have been made.”
87414 ^ what then will we say?
87417 ^ that gentiles
87419 ^ - not pursuing righteousness, have attained righteousness,
87425 ^ righteousness now
87427 ^ that [is] by faith;
87430 ^ israel however,
87432 ^ pursuing a law of righteousness, to [that] law not did attain.
87439 ^ because of why?
87441 ^ because [it was] not by faith,
87445 ^ but as by works.
87449 ^ they stumbled over the stone - of stumbling,
87454 ^ as it has been written:
87456 ^ behold
87457 ^ i lay in zion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense;
87465 ^ and
87466 ^ the [one] believing on him, never will be put to shame.”
87472 ^ brothers, the indeed
87475 ^ desire - of my heart and the supplication to - god on behalf of them [is] for salvation.
87489 ^ i bear witness for about them,
87492 ^ that zeal for god they have,
87496 ^ but not according to knowledge.
87500 ^ being ignorant of for the - of god righteousness,
87506 ^ and
87507 ^ the own righteousness seeking to establish, to the righteousness - of god, not they submitted.
87518 ^ [the] end for
87520 ^ of law [is] christ, unto righteousness
87524 ^ to everyone - believing.
87527 ^ moses for writes [of] the righteousness that [is] of the law,
87536 ^ that the
87538 ^ having done these things man, will live by them.”
87544 ^ the however
87546 ^ of faith righteousness, thus speaks:
87551 ^ not you should say in the heart of you,
87557 ^ who will ascend into - heaven?’
87562 ^ that is,
87564 ^ christ to bring down,
87566 ^ or, who will descend into the abyss?’
87572 ^ that is,
87574 ^ christ out from [the] dead to bring up.
87578 ^ but what says it?
87581 ^ near you the word is, in the mouth of you and in the heart of you.”
87595 ^ that is, the word - of faith
87601 ^ which we proclaim,
87603 ^ that if you confess with the mouth of you, [the] lord [is] jesus,
87612 ^ and believe in the heart of you,
87618 ^ that - god him raised out from [the] dead,
87625 ^ you will be saved.
87626 ^ in the heart for is belief unto righteousness;
87631 ^ in the mouth now is confession unto salvation.
87636 ^ says for the scripture,
88193 ^ again to graft in them.
88196 ^ if for you, out of the according to nature were cut off
88204 ^ a wild olive tree,
88205 ^ and, contrary to nature, were grafted into a cultivated olive tree,
88211 ^ how much more these, who according to nature [are], will be grafted into the own olive tree!
88221 ^ not for i want you
88225 ^ to be ignorant, brothers, of the mystery this,
88230 ^ that not you may be in yourselves wise,
88236 ^ that a hardening in part - to israel has happened,
88243 ^ until that the fullness of the gentiles may come in;
88250 ^ and so all israel will be saved,
88255 ^ as it has been written:
88257 ^ will come out of zion
88260 ^ the [one] delivering,
88262 ^ he will remove ungodliness from jacob.
88266 ^ and this [is] to them the from me covenant,
88273 ^ when i shall take away the sins of them.”
88278 ^ as regards indeed
88280 ^ the gospel, [they are] enemies on account of you;
88285 ^ as regards however
88287 ^ the election, beloved on account of the patriarchs.
88293 ^ irrevocable for [are] the gifts and the calling - of god.
88302 ^ just as for you once were disobedient - to god,
88309 ^ now however have been shown mercy the of these disobedience,
88315 ^ so also these now have been disobedient, the for your mercy,
88323 ^ so that also they now may have mercy shown [them].
88328 ^ has bound up for - god - all in disobedience,
88336 ^ that - all he may show mercy to.
88340 ^ o, [the] depth of riches, both of wisdom and knowledge of god!
88348 ^ how unsearchable the judgments of him,
88353 ^ and untraceable the ways of him!
88358 ^ who for has known [the] mind of [the] lord,
88363 ^ or who counselor of him has been?”
88368 ^ or who has first given to him,
88372 ^ and it will be recompensed to him?”
88375 ^ for from him, and through him, and unto him - [are] all things.
88386 ^ to him [be] the glory to the ages! amen.
88393 ^ i exhort therefore you, brothers,
88397 ^ through the compassions - of god, to present the bodies of you a sacrifice
88407 ^ living, holy, well-pleasing, - to god which is [the] reasonable service of you.
88416 ^ and not be conformed to the age this,
88422 ^ but be transformed by the renewing of the mind,
88428 ^ for - to prove by you,
88432 ^ what [is] the will - of god, - good and well-pleasing and perfect.
88443 ^ i say for through the grace
88448 ^ - having been given to me
88451 ^ to everyone - being among you,
88456 ^ not to be high-minded
88905 ^ for you out of sleep to awaken;
88909 ^ now for nearer [is] of us the salvation
88915 ^ than when first we believed.
88918 ^ the night is nearly over,
88921 ^ - and
88923 ^ the day has drawn near.
88925 ^ we should cast off therefore the works - of darkness;
88931 ^ we should put on now the armor - of light.
88937 ^ as in daytime, properly we should walk,
88942 ^ not in reveling and drinking,
88946 ^ not in sexual immorality and sensuality,
88950 ^ not in dissension and jealousy.
88954 ^ but put on the lord jesus christ,
88960 ^ and of the flesh provision not make for desires.
89011 ^ - judging another’s servant?
89015 ^ to the own master he stands
89019 ^ or falls.
89021 ^ he will be upheld however;
89023 ^ able is for the lord
89027 ^ to uphold him.
89029 ^ one truly for judges a day [to be] above [another] day;
89036 ^ one however judges every day [alike].
89041 ^ each in the own mind, let be fully assured.
89175 ^ - not to put [any] stumbling block before [your] brother,
89181 ^ or snare.
89183 ^ i know
89184 ^ and i am persuaded in [the] lord jesus
89189 ^ that nothing [is] unclean of itself;
89194 ^ if not
89196 ^ to him reckoning
89198 ^ anything unclean to be,
89201 ^ to that one unclean [it is].
89203 ^ if for on account of food, the brother of you is grieved,
89211 ^ no longer according to love are you walking.
89215 ^ not with the food of you that one destroy,
89221 ^ for whom christ died.
89225 ^ not let be spoken of as evil, therefore, your - good.
89231 ^ not for is the kingdom - of god eating and drinking,
89241 ^ but righteousness and peace and joy in [the] spirit holy.
89726 ^ - to come to you for many years,
89733 ^ whenever - i may go to - spain
89739 ^ i hope for
89741 ^ going through
89742 ^ to see you,
89744 ^ and by you to be equipped there,
89749 ^ if of you first in part i should be filled.
89755 ^ now however i am going to jerusalem,
89760 ^ ministering to the saints.
89763 ^ were pleased for macedonia and achaia
89768 ^ a contribution certain to make for the poor among the saints - in jerusalem.
89779 ^ they were pleased for,
89781 ^ and debtors they are
89784 ^ of them.
89785 ^ if for the things spiritual of them have shared in the gentiles,
89793 ^ they ought also
89795 ^ in the material things to minister to them.
89800 ^ this therefore having finished
89803 ^ and having sealed to them the fruit this, i will set off through you into spain.
89814 ^ i know now
89816 ^ that
89817 ^ coming to you, in [the] fullness of the blessing of christ i will come.
89825 ^ i exhort now you, brothers, by the lord of us jesus christ and by the love of the spirit,
89841 ^ to strive together with me in the prayers for me to - god,
89851 ^ so that i may be delivered
89853 ^ from those refusing to be persuaded in - judea,
89859 ^ and the service of me, which [is] in jerusalem, acceptable to the saints may be,
89870 ^ so that
89871 ^ in joy, having come to you by [the] will of god, i may be refreshed with you.
89881 ^ - and
89883 ^ the god - of peace [be] with all of you. amen.
89890 ^ i commend now to you phoebe, the sister of us,

89905 ^ that her you might receive in [the] lord worthily - of the saints,
89913 ^ and you might assist her

90949 ^ what eye not has seen,
90953 ^ and ear not has heard,
90957 ^ and into heart of man not has entered,
90963 ^ what has prepared - god

91040 ^ which also we speak, not in taught of human wisdom words,
91049 ^ but in [those] taught of [the] spirit,

91056 ^ [the] natural however

91109 ^ but as to fleshly, as to infants in christ.
91116 ^ milk you i gave to drink,
91119 ^ not solid food,
91121 ^ not yet for were you able.
91124 ^ in fact, not still now are you able;
91129 ^ still for fleshly you are.
91133 ^ where for [are] among you jealousy and strife,
91140 ^ not fleshly are you,
91143 ^ and according to man are walking?
91147 ^ when for might say one,
91151 ^ i indeed am of paul,
91155 ^ another however,
91157 ^ i of apollos,
91159 ^ not fleshly are you?

91166 ^ who now is paul?
91170 ^ servants
91171 ^ through whom you believed,
91174 ^ also to each as the lord has given?
91180 ^ i planted,
91182 ^ apollos watered,
91184 ^ but - god kept [it] growing.
91188 ^ so neither
91190 ^ the [one] planting is anything,
91194 ^ nor the [one] watering,
91197 ^ but [only] the [one]
91199 ^ giving growth — god.
91201 ^ the [one] planting now
91204 ^ and the [one] watering, one are;
91209 ^ each now the own reward will receive, according to the own labor.
91219 ^ of god for we are
91222 ^ fellow workers;
91223 ^ god’s field, god’s building you are.
91228 ^ according to the grace - of god
91233 ^ - having been given to me, as a wise master builder [the] foundation i have laid;
91241 ^ another however is building upon [it].
91244 ^ each one however let take heed
91247 ^ how he builds upon [it].
92692 ^ in [the] lord having been called [being] a slave, a freedman of [the] lord is;
92699 ^ likewise the [one] free
92702 ^ having been called, a slave is
92705 ^ of christ.
92706 ^ with a price you were bought;
92708 ^ not become slaves of men.
92712 ^ each wherein that he was called, brothers,
92717 ^ in that let him abide with god.
92722 ^ concerning now
92724 ^ the virgins, a commandment of [the] lord not i have;
92730 ^ judgment however i give,
92733 ^ as having received mercy from [the] lord,
92737 ^ trustworthy to be.
92739 ^ i think therefore
92741 ^ this good is, because of the
92746 ^ present necessity,
92748 ^ that [it is] good for a man
92751 ^ - in the same manner
92753 ^ to remain.
92754 ^ have you been bound to a wife?
92756 ^ not seek to be loosed.
92759 ^ have you been loosed from a wife?
92762 ^ not seek a wife.
92765 ^ if however also you shall have married,
92769 ^ not you did sin;
92771 ^ and if shall have married the virgin,
92776 ^ not she did sin;
92778 ^ tribulation however in the flesh will have - such;
92785 ^ i now you am sparing.
92789 ^ this now i say, brothers:
92793 ^ the season
92795 ^ shortened is.
92797 ^ - from now on that both
92801 ^ those having wives,
92804 ^ as none
92806 ^ having should be;
92808 ^ and
92809 ^ those weeping,
92811 ^ as not
92813 ^ weeping;
92814 ^ and
92815 ^ those rejoicing,
92817 ^ as not
92819 ^ rejoicing;
92820 ^ and
92821 ^ those buying,
92823 ^ as not
92825 ^ possessing;
92826 ^ and
92827 ^ those using the world,
92831 ^ as not
92833 ^ using [it] as their own.
92834 ^ is passing away for the present form of the world this.
92841 ^ i desire now
92843 ^ you without concern to be.
92846 ^ the unmarried man cares for the things of the lord,
92852 ^ how he should please the lord;
95849 ^ sitting by,
95850 ^ the first let be silent.
95853 ^ you are able for
95855 ^ [one] by one all to prophesy,
95859 ^ so that all may learn
95862 ^ and all may be exhorted.
95865 ^ and spirits of prophets, to prophets are subject.
95870 ^ not for he is of disorder the god,
95876 ^ but of peace.
95878 ^ as in all the churches of the saints, the women in the churches let them be silent.
95891 ^ not for it is allowed to them
95895 ^ to speak,
95896 ^ but to be in submission,
95898 ^ as also the law says.
95903 ^ if however
95905 ^ anything to learn they desire,
95908 ^ at home the own husbands let them ask;
95914 ^ shameful for it is for a woman
95918 ^ to speak in [the] church.
95921 ^ or from you the word - of god has gone out?
95929 ^ or to you only has it come?
95934 ^ if anyone considers
95937 ^ a prophet himself to be,
95939 ^ or spiritual,
95941 ^ let him recognize
95942 ^ the things i write to you
95945 ^ that of [the] lord are
95948 ^ [the] commands.
95949 ^ if however anyone is ignorant,
95953 ^ let him be ignored.
95954 ^ so, brothers of me, earnestly desire
95958 ^ - to prophesy,
95960 ^ and
95961 ^ - to speak not do forbid in tongues.
95966 ^ all things however properly and with order let be done.
95973 ^ i make known now to you, brothers, the gospel
95979 ^ that i proclaimed to you,
95982 ^ which also you received,
95985 ^ in which also you stand,
95989 ^ by which also you are being saved,
95993 ^ to the word i proclaimed to you,
95997 ^ if you hold fast;
95999 ^ unless if not, in vain you have believed.
96004 ^ i delivered for to you in the foremost
96009 ^ what also i received,
96012 ^ that christ died for the sins of us according to the scriptures,
96022 ^ and that he was buried,
96025 ^ and that he was raised the day the third according to the scriptures,
96035 ^ and that he appeared to cephas,
96039 ^ then to the twelve.
96042 ^ thereafter he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once,
96048 ^ of whom the greater part remain until now;
96055 ^ some however have fallen asleep.
96058 ^ then he appeared to james,
96061 ^ then to the apostles all.
96065 ^ last then
96067 ^ of all, as the untimely birth, he appeared also to me.
96073 ^ i for am the least of the apostles,
96080 ^ who not am fit
96084 ^ to be called an apostle,
96086 ^ because i persecuted the church - of god.
96092 ^ [by the] grace however
96094 ^ of god, i am
96096 ^ what i am,
96098 ^ and the grace of him - toward me not void has been.
96108 ^ rather, more abundantly than them all i toiled,
96113 ^ not i however,
96116 ^ but the grace - of god that [was] with me.
96124 ^ whether therefore i or they,
96129 ^ thus we preach,
96131 ^ and thus you believed.
96134 ^ if now christ is preached
96138 ^ that out from [the] dead he has been raised,
96142 ^ how say among you some
96147 ^ that a resurrection of [the] dead not there is?
96152 ^ if however a resurrection of [the] dead not there is,
96158 ^ neither christ has been raised;
96161 ^ if then christ not has been raised,
96166 ^ [is] void then also the preaching of us,
96172 ^ void also the faith of you.
96177 ^ we are found then also false witnesses - of god,
96183 ^ because we have witnessed concerning - god,
96188 ^ that he raised up - christ,
96192 ^ whom not he has raised
96195 ^ if then [the] dead not are raised.
96200 ^ if for [the] dead not are raised,
96205 ^ neither christ has been raised;
96208 ^ if then christ not has been raised,
96213 ^ [is] futile the faith of you
96217 ^ still you are in the sins of you.
96223 ^ then also
96225 ^ those having fallen asleep in christ have perished.
96230 ^ if
96231 ^ in the life this, in christ having hope we are, only,
96240 ^ more to be pitied than all men we are.
96244 ^ now however christ has been raised out from [the] dead,
96250 ^ firstfruit
96251 ^ of those having fallen asleep.
96253 ^ since for by a man [came] death,
96258 ^ also by a man resurrection of [the] dead.
96263 ^ for as indeed in - adam all die,
96270 ^ so also in - christ, all will be made alive.
96277 ^ each however in the own order:
96283 ^ [the] firstfruit christ,
96285 ^ then those of christ at the coming of him;
96293 ^ then the end,
96296 ^ when he shall hand over the kingdom to the god and father,
96304 ^ when he shall have annulled all dominion and all authority and power.
96313 ^ it behooves for
96315 ^ him to reign
96317 ^ until that he shall have put all the enemies under the feet of him.
96327 ^ [the] last enemy to be abolished [is]
96330 ^ - death.
96332 ^ all things,” for he has put in subjection, under the feet of him.”
96339 ^ when however it may be said
96342 ^ that all things have been put in subjection,
96345 ^ [it is] evident
96346 ^ that
96347 ^ [is] excepted the [one] having put in subjection to him - all things.
96353 ^ when now shall have been put in subjection to him - all things,
96359 ^ then also himself the son will be put in subjection
96365 ^ to the [one] having put in subjection to him - all things,
96370 ^ so that may be - god - all in all.
96378 ^ otherwise what will they do
96381 ^ who are baptized for the dead?
96386 ^ if at all [the] dead not are raised,
96391 ^ why also are they baptized for them?
96396 ^ why also, we are in danger every hour?
96402 ^ every day i die,
96405 ^ as surely as the in you boasting, brothers
96410 ^ which i have in christ jesus the lord of us.
96418 ^ if according to man, i fought wild beasts in ephesus,
96424 ^ what to me the profit?
96428 ^ if [the] dead not are raised,
96432 ^ let us eat
96433 ^ and let us drink,
96435 ^ tomorrow for we die.”
96438 ^ not be misled:
96440 ^ do corrupt morals good, companionships bad.”
96445 ^ sober up righteously
96447 ^ and not sin;
96450 ^ ignorance for
96452 ^ of god some have;
96455 ^ to [the] shame of you i speak.
96459 ^ but will say someone,
96462 ^ how are raised the dead?
96466 ^ with what then
96468 ^ body do they come?
96470 ^ fool
96471 ^ you! what you sow not does come to life,
96476 ^ if not it dies.
96479 ^ and
96480 ^ what you sow,
96482 ^ not the body
96485 ^ that will be you sow,
96488 ^ but a bare grain,
96491 ^ if it may be of wheat, or of some of the rest.
96498 ^ - but
96500 ^ god gives it a body,
96504 ^ as he has willed,
96506 ^ and to each of the seeds, its own body.
96512 ^ not all flesh [is] the same flesh,
96518 ^ but one indeed of men,
96522 ^ another now flesh of beasts,
96526 ^ another now flesh of birds,
96530 ^ another now of fish.
96533 ^ and bodies [there are] heavenly, and bodies earthly.
96539 ^ but one truly [is] the of the heavenly glory,
96546 ^ another now that of the earthly.
96551 ^ one [is] [the] glory of [the] sun,
96554 ^ and another [the] glory of [the] moon,
96558 ^ and another [the] glory of [the] stars;
96562 ^ star for from star differs in glory.
96568 ^ so also [is] the resurrection of the dead.
96574 ^ it is sown in decay,
96577 ^ it is raised in immortality.
96580 ^ it is sown in dishonor,
96583 ^ it is raised in glory.
96586 ^ it is sown in weakness,
96589 ^ it is raised in power.
96592 ^ it is sown a body natural,
96595 ^ it is raised a body spiritual.
96598 ^ if there is a body natural,
96602 ^ there is also spiritual.
96605 ^ so also it has been written:
96608 ^ became the first man adam into a soul
96615 ^ living;
96616 ^ the last adam into a spirit
96621 ^ life-giving.”
96622 ^ however not first [was] the spiritual,
96627 ^ but the natural,
96630 ^ then the spiritual.
96633 ^ the first man [was] from [the] earth, made of dust;
96639 ^ the second man from heaven.
96644 ^ as the [one] made of dust,
96647 ^ so also [are] those of the earth;
96651 ^ and as the heavenly [one],
96655 ^ so also those of heaven.
96659 ^ and as we have born the image of the earthly,
96666 ^ we shall bear also the image of the heavenly.
96672 ^ this now i say, brothers,
96676 ^ that flesh and blood,
96680 ^ [the] kingdom of god to inherit not is able,
96685 ^ nor the decay, the immortality does inherit.
96691 ^ behold,
96692 ^ a mystery to you i tell.
96695 ^ all not we will sleep;
96698 ^ all however we will be changed — in an instant, in [the] twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet.
96710 ^ the trumpet will sound for,
96712 ^ and the dead will be raised imperishable,
96717 ^ and we will be changed.
96720 ^ it behooves for
96722 ^ the perishable this, to put on imperishable;
96727 ^ and the mortal this, to put on immortality.
96733 ^ when now the perishable this shall have put on [the] imperishable,
96740 ^ and the mortal this shall have put on immortality,
96746 ^ then will come to pass the word
96750 ^ - having been written:
96752 ^ has been swallowed up - death in victory.”
96757 ^ where of you, o death,
96760 ^ the victory?
96762 ^ where of you, o death,
96765 ^ the sting?”
96767 ^ - and
96769 ^ the sting - of death [is] - sin;
96774 ^ - and
96776 ^ the power - of sin, the law;
96781 ^ to however
96783 ^ god [be] thanks,
96785 ^ the [one] giving us the victory through the lord of us jesus christ.
96796 ^ therefore, brothers of me beloved, steadfast be,
96802 ^ immovable,
96803 ^ abounding in the work of the lord always,
96810 ^ knowing
96811 ^ that the toil of you not is in vain in [the] lord.
96820 ^ concerning now
96822 ^ the collection which [is] for the saints,
96828 ^ as i have directed the churches - of galatia,
96834 ^ so also you are to do.
96838 ^ every first of the week, each of you aside him let put,
96846 ^ treasuring up what
96848 ^ if he may be prospered in,
96850 ^ so that not when i might come
96854 ^ then collections there should be.
96857 ^ when then i shall have arrived,
96860 ^ whomever if you might approve,
96863 ^ with letters these i will send
96867 ^ to carry the bounty of you to jerusalem.
96873 ^ if then suitable it is
96877 ^ for me also
96879 ^ to go,
96880 ^ with me they will go.
96883 ^ i will come however to you,
96887 ^ when macedonia i shall have gone through;
96890 ^ macedonia for i am going through.
96893 ^ with you then
96896 ^ possibly i will stay,
96898 ^ or even i will winter,
96901 ^ so that you me may equip,
96905 ^ wherever if i may go.
96908 ^ not i want for
96911 ^ you now in passing to see;
96916 ^ i hope indeed
96918 ^ a time certain to remain with you,
96923 ^ if the lord permits.
96927 ^ i will remain however in ephesus until - pentecost.
96934 ^ a door for to me has opened
96938 ^ great and productive,
96941 ^ and
96942 ^ are opposing many.
96944 ^ if now comes timothy,
96948 ^ see
96949 ^ that without fear he might be with you;
96954 ^ the for
96956 ^ work of [the] lord he is doing, as also i.
96961 ^ not anyone therefore him should despise.
96966 ^ equip however him in peace,
96971 ^ so that he might come to me;
96975 ^ i am expecting for him, with the brothers.
96981 ^ concerning now
96983 ^ apollos the brother, greatly i exhorted him
96989 ^ that he should go to you with the brothers,
96996 ^ and at all not was [his] will
97001 ^ that now he should come;
97004 ^ he will come however
97006 ^ when he shall have opportunity.
97008 ^ watch you;
97009 ^ stand firm in the faith;
97013 ^ act like men;
97014 ^ be strong.
97015 ^ all things of you, in love let be done.
97020 ^ i exhort now you, brothers,
97024 ^ you know the house of stephanas,
97028 ^ that it is firstfruit - of achaia,
97033 ^ and to service to the saints, they have devoted themselves,
97040 ^ that also you be subject - to such as these, and
97047 ^ to everyone - joining in the work
97050 ^ and laboring.
97052 ^ i rejoice however at the coming of stephanas, and fortunatus, and achaicus;
97062 ^ because - your deficiency, these have filled up.
97068 ^ they refreshed for - my spirit and - yours.
97076 ^ recognize therefore - such as these.
97080 ^ greet you, the churches - of asia.
97086 ^ greet you in [the] lord heartily, aquila and prisca, with the at house of them church.
97100 ^ greet you, the brothers all.
97105 ^ greet one another with a kiss holy.
97110 ^ the greeting, the own hand of paul.
97116 ^ if anyone not loves the lord,
97122 ^ let him be accursed.
97124 ^ marana tha!
97126 ^ the grace of the lord jesus [be] with you.
97133 ^ the love of me [be] with all you in christ jesus.
97142 ^ paul, apostle of christ jesus by [the] will of god, and timothy, the brother, to the church - of god
97157 ^ - being in corinth, with the saints
97164 ^ all - being in all - achaia.
97171 ^ grace to you
97173 ^ and peace from god [the] father of us and [the] lord jesus christ.
97183 ^ blessed [be] the god and father of the lord of us jesus christ, the father - of compassions, and god of all comfort,
97201 ^ the [one] comforting us in all the tribulation of us,
97209 ^ for - to be able
97212 ^ us to comfort those in every tribulation through the comfort
97221 ^ with which we are comforted ourselves by - god,
97227 ^ because as abound the sufferings of the christ toward us,
97236 ^ thus so through - christ abounds also the comfort of us.
97245 ^ if however we are constricted,
97248 ^ [it is] for - your comfort and salvation;
97254 ^ if we are encouraged,
97256 ^ [it is] for - your comfort,
97260 ^ - operating in [the] endurance of the same sufferings
97267 ^ that also we suffer.
97271 ^ and the hope of us [is] steadfast for you,
97278 ^ knowing
97279 ^ that as partners you are
97283 ^ of the sufferings,
97285 ^ so also of the comfort.
97289 ^ not for do we want
97292 ^ you to be ignorant brothers, as to the affliction of us
97299 ^ - having happened in - asia,
97304 ^ that against excessively beyond [our] power, we were weighed,
97310 ^ so as to despair for us
97313 ^ even - to live.
97316 ^ but we in ourselves, the sentence - of death had,
97325 ^ in order that not
97327 ^ trusting we should be in ourselves,
97331 ^ but in - god,
97335 ^ the [one] raising the dead,
97339 ^ who from such a great a death has delivered us,
97345 ^ and will deliver [us],
97347 ^ in whom we have hope
97350 ^ that also still he will deliver [us],
97354 ^ joining together also of you for us by supplication,
97361 ^ so that by many persons, for the toward us grace bestowed, through many, thanks may be given for us.
97374 ^ - for
97376 ^ the boasting of us this is,
97380 ^ the testimony of the conscience of us,
97385 ^ that in [the] holiness and sincerity - of god, and not in wisdom fleshly, but in [the] grace of god, we have conducted ourselves in the world,
97405 ^ more abundantly now toward you.
97409 ^ no for other things we write to you,
97414 ^ other than what you read
97418 ^ or even understand;
97421 ^ i hope now
97423 ^ that to [the] end you will understand,
97427 ^ as also you have understood us in part,
97433 ^ so that boasting of you we are,
97437 ^ even as also you [are] ours, in the day of the lord of us jesus.
97448 ^ and with this - confidence i was planning previously
97454 ^ to you to come,
97457 ^ so that a second blessing of grace you might have,
97461 ^ and through you to pass through into macedonia,
97467 ^ and again from macedonia to come to you,
97474 ^ and by you to be set forward to - judea.
97987 ^ to reckon anything as of ourselves,
97992 ^ but the sufficiency of us [is] of - god,
97999 ^ who also has made competent us [as] ministers of a new covenant, not of [the] letter but of [the] spirit;
98010 ^ the for
98012 ^ letter kills,
98014 ^ - but
98016 ^ the spirit gives life.
98018 ^ if now the ministry - of death,
98024 ^ in letters having been engraved on stones, was produced in glory,
98031 ^ so as for not to be able
98034 ^ to look intently the sons of israel into the face of moses, on account of the glory of the face of him,
98048 ^ which is fading,
98050 ^ how not more, the ministry of the spirit will be in glory?
98060 ^ if for in the ministry - of condemnation [was] glory,
98067 ^ much more abounds the ministry - of righteousness [in] glory!
98075 ^ even for, not has been glorified
98079 ^ that having been made glorious in this - respect, on account of the
98087 ^ surpassing [it] glory.
98089 ^ if for
98091 ^ that which is fading away [was] through glory,
98095 ^ much more [is]
98097 ^ that remaining in glory!
99223 ^ the [one] comforting the downcast comforted us,
99229 ^ - god, by the coming of titus,
99235 ^ not only now by the coming of him,
99242 ^ but also by the comfort
99247 ^ with which he was comforted as to you;
99251 ^ relating to us - your earnest desire, - your mourning, - your zeal for me,
99264 ^ so as for me the more
99267 ^ to rejoice.
99268 ^ for if also i have grieved you in the letter,
99276 ^ not i do regret [it].
99278 ^ though even i did regret [it];
99281 ^ i see indeed
99283 ^ that the letter that,
99287 ^ if even for an hour, grieved you.
99293 ^ now i rejoice,
99295 ^ not that you were grieved,
99298 ^ but that you were grieved unto repentance;
99303 ^ you were grieved for according to god,
99307 ^ so that in nothing you might suffer loss through us.
99313 ^ the for,
99315 ^ according to god grief, repentance to salvation
99321 ^ without regret produces;
99323 ^ - and
99325 ^ the of the world grief, death produces.
99330 ^ behold for, this very same
99959 ^ to exhort the brothers
99962 ^ that they should go before unto you
99966 ^ and should complete beforehand the
99969 ^ foreannounced blessing of you
99972 ^ this, ready to be thus as a blessing, and not as covetousness.
99982 ^ this now:
100252 ^ to avenge all disobedience,
100255 ^ when might have been fulfilled your - obedience.
100260 ^ the things according to appearance are you looking.
100264 ^ if anyone is persuaded
100267 ^ in himself of christ to be,
100270 ^ this let him reckon again within himself,
100275 ^ that as he [is] of christ,
100279 ^ so also [are] we.
100282 ^ if even for more abundantly somewhat i should boast concerning the authority of us,
100292 ^ which has given [us] the lord for building [you] up and not for tearing down you,
100303 ^ not i will be ashamed,
100305 ^ that not [i] might seem
100308 ^ as if - to frighten you by means of the letters.
100315 ^ for the letters, indeed
100319 ^ they say,
100320 ^ [are] weighty and strong,
100323 ^ - but
100325 ^ the presence of the body weak,
100329 ^ and the speech
100332 ^ having been ignored.
100333 ^ this let reckon - such a one,
100337 ^ that such as we are - in word by letters
100344 ^ being absent,
100345 ^ such [we are] also
100347 ^ being present - in action.
100350 ^ not for dare we
100353 ^ to classify
100354 ^ or to compare ourselves [with] some
100358 ^ - themselves
100360 ^ commending;
100361 ^ but these
100363 ^ by themselves, themselves measuring,
100367 ^ and comparing themselves with themselves, not understand.
100373 ^ we however not into the things beyond measure will boast,
100380 ^ but according to the measure of the area
100386 ^ that has assigned to us - god,
100391 ^ a measure
100392 ^ to reach as far as also
100395 ^ you.
100396 ^ not for
100398 ^ as not
100400 ^ reaching to you, we are overextending ourselves;
100405 ^ as far as for also
100408 ^ you, we came in the gospel - of christ,
100415 ^ not to the things beyond measure boasting in others’ labors,
100423 ^ hope however having,
100426 ^ increasing the faith of you,
100430 ^ among you to be enlarged according to the area of us, to abundance,
100439 ^ so as that beyond you to preach the gospel,
100444 ^ not in another’s area, in things ready to boast.
101227 ^ to come to you,
101230 ^ and not i will burden [you];
101233 ^ not for i seek what [is] yours,
101238 ^ but you.
101240 ^ not for ought the children
101245 ^ for the parents to treasure up,
101248 ^ but the parents for the children.
101253 ^ i now most gladly will spend,
101257 ^ and will be utterly spent, for the souls of you.
101263 ^ if more abundantly you loving,
101267 ^ less i am loved?
101269 ^ be it so however,
101271 ^ i not did burden you;
101275 ^ but
101276 ^ being crafty, by trickery you i caught.
101281 ^ not any of whom i have sent to you,
101287 ^ by him did i exploit you?
101291 ^ i urged titus [to go],
101293 ^ and sent with [him] the brother.
101297 ^ not did exploit you titus?
101301 ^ not in the same spirit did we walk?
101306 ^ not in the same steps?
101310 ^ all along have you been thinking
101312 ^ that to you we have been making a defense?
101315 ^ before god in christ we speak,
101320 ^ - but
101322 ^ all things, beloved, for - your edification.
101328 ^ i fear for
101330 ^ lest perhaps,
101332 ^ having come,
101333 ^ not such as i wish i may find
101337 ^ you,
101338 ^ and i might be found by you
101341 ^ such as not you do wish;
101344 ^ lest perhaps quarreling, jealousy, anger, contentions, slander, gossip, conceit, disorder;
101354 ^ lest
101355 ^ again having come of me, should humble me the god of me as to you,
101365 ^ and i should mourn over many
101368 ^ of those having before sinned
101370 ^ and not having repented of the impurity and sexual immorality and sensuality
101380 ^ that they have practiced.
101382 ^ third this [time] i am coming to you.
101387 ^ in [the] mouth of two witnesses or three, will be established every matter.”
101396 ^ i have warned
101397 ^ and i warn,
101399 ^ as being present the second time,
101403 ^ and being absent now
101406 ^ those having sinned before, and the rest all,
101412 ^ that if i come to the [same] again,
101418 ^ not i will spare [anyone],
101420 ^ since a proof you seek,
101423 ^ -
101424 ^ in me speaking of christ,
101428 ^ who toward you not is weak,
101433 ^ but is powerful among you.
101437 ^ and for he was crucified in weakness,
101442 ^ yet he lives by power god’s.
101447 ^ also for we are weak in him,
101453 ^ but we will live with him by power god’s toward you.
101462 ^ yourselves examine
101464 ^ whether you are in the faith;
101469 ^ yourselves test.
101471 ^ or not do you recognize yourselves
101475 ^ that jesus christ [is] in you,
101480 ^ if not unapproved you are?
101484 ^ i hope now
101486 ^ that you will know
101488 ^ that we not are unapproved.
101493 ^ we pray now to - god,
101498 ^ not to do you wrong nothing,
101503 ^ not that we approved might appear,
101508 ^ but that you what [is] right may do;
101514 ^ we though as unapproved might appear.
101519 ^ nothing for have we power
101522 ^ any against the truth,
101526 ^ but for the truth.
101530 ^ we rejoice for
101532 ^ when we might be weak,
101535 ^ you however strong might be.
101539 ^ but this also: we pray for
101542 ^ the of you perfection.
101545 ^ because of therefore these things,
101548 ^ being absent i write,
101550 ^ so that
101551 ^ being present, not with severity i should treat [you], according to the authority
101558 ^ that the lord has given me, for building up and not for tearing down.
101569 ^ finally, brothers, rejoice!
101572 ^ be perfected,
101573 ^ be exhorted,
101574 ^ [be of] the same mind,
101577 ^ be at peace.
101578 ^ and the god - of love and peace will be with you.
101588 ^ greet one another with a holy kiss.
101593 ^ greet you, the saints all.
101598 ^ the grace of the lord jesus christ, and the love of god, and the fellowship of the holy spirit, [be] with all of you.
101618 ^ paul, an apostle, not from men, nor through man, but through jesus christ, and god [the] father,
101633 ^ the [one] having raised him out from [the] dead — and the with me all brothers, to the churches - of galatia:
101648 ^ grace to you
101650 ^ and peace from god father of us and the lord jesus christ,
101660 ^ the [one] having given himself for the sins of us,
101667 ^ so that he might deliver us out of the age of
101674 ^ having come presently evil, according to the will of the god and father of us,
101684 ^ to whom [be] the glory to the ages of the ages. amen.
101693 ^ i am astonished
101694 ^ that so quickly you are deserting
101698 ^ from the [one] having called you in [the] grace of christ, to a different gospel,
101708 ^ which not is another;
101712 ^ if not some there are
101716 ^ who are troubling you,
101719 ^ and are desiring
101721 ^ to pervert the gospel - of christ.
101726 ^ but even if we or an angel out of heaven should preach a gospel to you
101736 ^ contrary to what we proclaimed to you,
101740 ^ accursed let him be!
101742 ^ as we have said before,
101744 ^ even now again i say,
101748 ^ if anyone [to] you is preaching a gospel
101752 ^ contrary to what you received,
101755 ^ accursed let him be!
101757 ^ presently for of men do i seek approval, or - god?
101764 ^ or do i seek
101766 ^ men to please?
101768 ^ for if yet men i were pleasing,
101772 ^ of christ a servant not - i would be.
101777 ^ i make known for to you, brothers, the gospel
101783 ^ - having been preached by me,
101787 ^ that not it is according to man.
101792 ^ neither for i from man received it,
101799 ^ nor was i taught [it],
101801 ^ but by a revelation of jesus christ.
101806 ^ you have heard of for - my way of life former in - judaism,
101815 ^ that beyond exceeding measure, i was persecuting the church - of god
101823 ^ and was destroying it.
101826 ^ and i was advancing in - judaism beyond many contemporaries in the countrymen of me,
101838 ^ more abundantly zealous being
101841 ^ of the fathers of me traditions.
101845 ^ when however was pleased - god
101850 ^ the [one] having selected me from [the] womb of mother of me,
101857 ^ and having called [me] by the grace of him,
101863 ^ to reveal the son of him in me,
101869 ^ that i might preach him among the gentiles,
101875 ^ immediately not i consulted with flesh and blood,
101881 ^ nor did i go up to jerusalem to the before me apostles,
101890 ^ but i went away into arabia,
101894 ^ and again returned to damascus.
101899 ^ then after years, three i went up to jerusalem
101906 ^ to make acquaintance with cephas,
101908 ^ and i remained with him days fifteen.
101914 ^ other however
101916 ^ of the apostles none i saw,
101920 ^ if not james, the brother of the lord.
101927 ^ in what now i write to you,
101931 ^ behold, before - god
101935 ^ -, not i lie.
101938 ^ then i went into the regions - of syria and - cilicia.
101948 ^ i was then
101950 ^ unknown - by face to the churches - of judea that [are] in christ.
102906 ^ crying out,
102907 ^ abba, - father!
102910 ^ so no longer you are a slave,
102914 ^ but a son;
102916 ^ if now a son,
102919 ^ also an heir through god.
102923 ^ but at that time indeed
102926 ^ not knowing god, you were enslaved to those
102931 ^ by nature not being gods;
102935 ^ now however,
102937 ^ having known god,
102939 ^ rather however having been known by god, how do you turn again to the weak and destitute principles,
103150 ^ unto slavery begetting,
103153 ^ which is hagar.
103156 ^ - and
103158 ^ hagar sinai mount is, in - arabia;
103165 ^ she corresponds now to the present jerusalem,
103170 ^ she is in slavery for with the children of her.
103176 ^ - but
103178 ^ the above jerusalem free is,
103182 ^ who is mother of us.
103186 ^ it has been written for:
103188 ^ rejoice, o barren woman,
103190 ^ the [one] not
103192 ^ bearing;
103193 ^ break forth
103194 ^ and call aloud,
103196 ^ the [one] not
103198 ^ travailing;
103199 ^ because many [are] the children of the desolate woman more,
103206 ^ than
103207 ^ of her having the husband.”
103211 ^ you now, brothers, like isaac, of promise children are.
103219 ^ but just as at that time
103222 ^ the [one] according to flesh
103225 ^ having been born was persecuting the [one born] according to spirit,
103230 ^ so also [it is] now.
103233 ^ but what says the scripture?
103238 ^ cast out the slave woman and the son of her;
103245 ^ no for
103247 ^ not will inherit the son of the slave woman along with the son of the free.”
103258 ^ so then, brothers, not we are of [the] slave woman children,
103264 ^ but of the free.
103267 ^ in freedom, us christ has set free;
103272 ^ stand firm, therefore,
103274 ^ and not again in a yoke of slavery entangle yourselves.
103280 ^ behold,
103281 ^ i paul say to you
103285 ^ that if you shall become circumcised,
103288 ^ christ you nothing will profit.
103292 ^ i testify now again to every man
103297 ^ being circumcised
103298 ^ that a debtor he is
103301 ^ all the law to keep.
103305 ^ you are severed from christ,
103308 ^ whoever in [the] law are being justified;
103312 ^ from grace you have fallen away.
103315 ^ we for, through [the] spirit by faith, [the] hope of righteousness eagerly await.
103323 ^ in for
103325 ^ christ jesus, neither circumcision any has power,
103331 ^ nor uncircumcision;
103333 ^ but only faith
103335 ^ through love working.
103338 ^ you were running well.
103340 ^ who you cut into,
103343 ^ the truth not to obey?
103347 ^ [this] persuasion [is] not
103350 ^ of the [one] calling you.
103354 ^ a little leaven whole the lump leavens.
103360 ^ i am confident as to you in [the] lord,

104209 ^ being named, not only in the age this, but also
104218 ^ in the [one] coming.
104221 ^ and all things he put under the feet of him,
104228 ^ and him gave [to be] head over all things to the church,
104236 ^ which is the body of him, the fullness
104243 ^ of the [one] - all in all
104248 ^ filling.
104249 ^ and you, being dead in the trespasses and the sins of you,
104259 ^ in which once you walked, according to the age, the world of this, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit
104278 ^ - now
104280 ^ working in the sons - of disobedience,
104286 ^ among whom also we all lived once in the desires of the flesh of us,
104299 ^ doing the things willed of the flesh, and of [its] thoughts;
104307 ^ and we were children, by nature,
104311 ^ of wrath,

105591 ^ therefore it says:
105593 ^ awake you,
105594 ^ the [one] sleeping,
105596 ^ and rise up out from the dead,
105601 ^ and will shine upon you - christ.
105606 ^ take heed therefore carefully
105609 ^ how you walk,
105611 ^ not as unwise,
105614 ^ but as wise,
105617 ^ redeeming the time,
105620 ^ because the days evil are.
105625 ^ because of this, not be foolish,
105630 ^ but understand
105632 ^ what the will of the lord [is].
105637 ^ and not to be drunk with wine,
105641 ^ in which is debauchery.
105645 ^ instead be filled with [the] spirit,
105649 ^ speaking to each other in psalms and hymns and songs spiritual,
105658 ^ singing
105659 ^ and making melody in the heart of you to the lord,
105666 ^ giving thanks at all times for all things in [the] name the lord of us jesus christ to the god and father.
105681 ^ be submitting yourselves to one another in reverence of christ:
105686 ^ - wives, to the own husbands,
105691 ^ as to the lord;
105694 ^ for [the] husband is head of the wife,
105700 ^ as also - christ [is the] head of the church,
105707 ^ he himself savior of the body.
105711 ^ but even as the church is subjected - to christ,
105718 ^ so also - wives to the own husbands in everything.
105726 ^ - husbands, love the wives,
105731 ^ just as also - christ loved the church
105738 ^ and himself gave up for her,
105743 ^ so that her he might sanctify,
105746 ^ having cleansed [her] by the washing - of water by [the] word,
105753 ^ so that might present he to himself in glory the church,
105760 ^ not having spot or wrinkle or any of the such things,
105769 ^ but that it would be holy and blameless.
105775 ^ so ought also - husbands
105780 ^ to love the of themselves wives,
105784 ^ as the of themselves bodies.
106817 ^ surpassing themselves,
106819 ^ not the things of themselves each considering,
106824 ^ but also the things of others
106828 ^ each. this let mind be in you
106833 ^ which also in christ jesus [was]:
106838 ^ who
106839 ^ in [the] form of god existing, not something to be grasped considered
106846 ^ - to be equal with god,
106850 ^ but himself emptied,
106853 ^ [the] form of a servant having taken,
106856 ^ in [the] likeness of men having been made.
106860 ^ and
106861 ^ in appearance having been found as a man, he humbled himself,
106867 ^ having become obedient unto death, [the] death even of [the] cross.
106874 ^ therefore also - god him highly exalted,
106880 ^ and granted to him the name - above every name,
106889 ^ that at the name of jesus every knee should bow, in the heavens and on earth and under the earth,
106902 ^ and every tongue should confess
106906 ^ that [is] lord jesus christ, to [the] glory of god [the] father.
106914 ^ therefore, beloved of me,
106917 ^ just as always you have obeyed, not as in the presence of me only, but now much more in the absence
106934 ^ of me,
106935 ^ with fear and trembling - your own salvation work out.
106943 ^ god for is
106946 ^ the [one] working in you
106950 ^ both - to will
106953 ^ and - to work according to [his] good pleasure.
106959 ^ all things do without murmurings and disputings,
106965 ^ so that you may be blameless and innocent, children of god, unblemished in [the] midst of a generation crooked
106976 ^ and perverted,
106978 ^ among whom you shine as lights in [the] world,
106985 ^ [the] word of life holding forth, unto a boast to me in [the] day of christ
106994 ^ that not in vain i did run
106999 ^ nor in vain toil.
107003 ^ but if even i am being poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of the faith of you,
107015 ^ i am glad
107016 ^ and rejoice with all you.
107020 ^ - and
107022 ^ likewise also you be glad
107026 ^ and rejoice with me.
107029 ^ i hope however in [the] lord jesus,
107034 ^ timothy soon to send to you,
107038 ^ that i also may be encouraged,
107041 ^ having known the things concerning you.
107045 ^ no one for i have
107048 ^ like-minded,
107049 ^ who genuinely the things relative to you will care for.
107055 ^ those all for the things of themselves are seeking,
107061 ^ not the things jesus. of christ
107065 ^ - but
107067 ^ the proven worth of him you know,
107070 ^ that as a father [with] a child, with me he has served in the gospel.
107080 ^ him indeed therefore i hope
107084 ^ to send,
107085 ^ when - i shall have seen the things concerning me, immediately.
107092 ^ i am persuaded now in [the] lord
107096 ^ that also i myself soon i will come.
107101 ^ necessary now i esteemed [it],
107104 ^ epaphroditus, the brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier of me, of you now messenger and minister of the need of me, to send to you,
107123 ^ since
107124 ^ longing after he was
107126 ^ all you
107128 ^ and being deeply distressed
107130 ^ because you heard
107132 ^ that he was ill.
107134 ^ and indeed he was sick nearly unto death,
107139 ^ but - god had mercy on him;
107144 ^ not on him now alone,
107148 ^ but also on me,
107151 ^ that not sorrow upon sorrow i should have.
107157 ^ all the more speedily therefore i have sent him,
107161 ^ that
107162 ^ having seen him again, you may rejoice,
107166 ^ and i less anxious might be.
107169 ^ receive therefore him in [the] lord with all joy,
107177 ^ and - such in honor hold,
107182 ^ because for the sake of the work of christ, unto death he came near,
107190 ^ having disregarded [his] life
107193 ^ so that he might fill up the of you deficit
107198 ^ of toward me service.
107202 ^ - finally, brothers of me, rejoice in [the] lord.
108300 ^ - having been proclaimed in all creation - under - heaven,
108309 ^ of which have become i paul
108313 ^ a minister.
108314 ^ now i rejoice in the sufferings for you,
108321 ^ and i am filling up that which is lacking of the tribulations - of christ in the flesh of me for the body of him
108337 ^ which is the church,
108341 ^ of which became i
108344 ^ a minister, according to the administration - of god
108350 ^ - having been given me toward you,
108355 ^ to complete the word - of god, the mystery
108362 ^ - having been hidden from the ages and from the generations,
108371 ^ now however having been manifested to the saints of him,
108377 ^ to whom has willed - god
108381 ^ to make known
108382 ^ what [is] the riches of the glory of the mystery this among the gentiles,
108393 ^ which is
108395 ^ christ in you, the hope - of glory,
108402 ^ whom we preach,
108405 ^ admonishing every man
108408 ^ and teaching every man in all wisdom,
108415 ^ so that we may present every man perfect in christ.
108422 ^ unto this also i toil,
108426 ^ striving according to the energy of him
108431 ^ - working in me in power.
108437 ^ i want for you
108440 ^ to know
108441 ^ how great a struggle i am having for you, and those in laodicea,
108450 ^ and as many as not have seen the face of me in [the] flesh,
108459 ^ that may be encouraged the hearts of them,
108464 ^ having been knit together in love, and to all [the] riches of the full assurance - of understanding, to [the] knowledge of the mystery - of god, [which is] christ,
108482 ^ in whom are all the treasures - of wisdom and of knowledge hidden.
108493 ^ this i say
108495 ^ so that no one you might delude by persuasive speech.
108501 ^ if truly indeed in the flesh i am absent,
108507 ^ yet - in spirit with you i am,
108513 ^ rejoicing
108514 ^ and seeing your - good order and the firmness of the in christ faith of you.
108527 ^ just as therefore you have received - christ jesus the lord,
108535 ^ in him walk,
108538 ^ having been rooted
108539 ^ and being built up in him,
108543 ^ and being strengthened in the faith
108547 ^ just as you were taught,
108549 ^ abounding with thanksgiving.
108552 ^ take heed
108553 ^ lest anyone
108555 ^ you there will be - taking captive through - philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition - of men, according to the principles of the world and not according to christ.
108579 ^ for in him dwells all the fullness of the deity bodily;
108589 ^ and you are
108591 ^ in him complete,
108594 ^ who is the head of all rule and authority,
108602 ^ in whom also you were circumcised with [the] circumcision made without hands, in the removal of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision - of christ,
108620 ^ having been buried with him in - baptism,
108625 ^ in which also you were raised with [him] through the faith of the working - of god,
108636 ^ the [one] having raised him out from the dead.
108641 ^ and you dead being in the trespasses and in the uncircumcision of the flesh of you,
108654 ^ he made alive together you with him,
108658 ^ having forgiven us all the transgressions,
108663 ^ having blotted out the against us handwriting in the decrees,
108670 ^ which was adverse to us;
108674 ^ and it he has taken out of the way,
108680 ^ having nailed it to the cross.
109647 ^ to say anything.
109649 ^ they themselves for concerning us report
109654 ^ what reception we had from you,
109659 ^ and how you turned to - god from - idols,
109668 ^ to serve [the] god
109670 ^ living and true,
109673 ^ and to await the son of him from the heavens,
109681 ^ whom he raised out from the dead, jesus,
109687 ^ the [one] delivering us from the wrath
109693 ^ - coming.
109695 ^ you yourselves for know, brothers, the coming of us - to you
109705 ^ that not in vain has been;
109709 ^ but
109710 ^ having previously suffered
109711 ^ and having been mistreated
109713 ^ just as you know, in philippi, we had boldness in the god of us,
109722 ^ to speak to you the gospel - of god amid much conflict.
109732 ^ - for
109734 ^ the exhortation of us [is] not of error, nor of impurity, nor in trickery;
109745 ^ but just as we have been approved by - god
109751 ^ to be entrusted with the gospel,
109754 ^ so we speak,
109756 ^ not as men
109759 ^ pleasing,
109760 ^ but god,
109762 ^ the [one] examining the hearts of us.
109767 ^ never for at any time with word of flattery were we,
109774 ^ just as you know,
109776 ^ nor with a pretext for greed —
109780 ^ god [is] witness —
109782 ^ nor seeking from men glory, nor from you, nor from others,
109793 ^ [though] having authority
109794 ^ with weight to be, as christ’s apostles.
109800 ^ but we were infants in [the] midst of you,
109806 ^ as if a nursing mother would cherish - her own children.
110470 ^ to write to you,
110472 ^ yourselves for
110474 ^ you taught by god are,
110477 ^ in order - to love one another.
110481 ^ and for you are doing this toward all the brothers, the [ones] in all - macedonia.
110494 ^ we exhort however you, brothers,
110498 ^ to abound more and more,
110500 ^ and to strive earnestly
110502 ^ to live quietly
110503 ^ and to attend to the own,
110507 ^ and to work with the own hands of you,
110513 ^ just as you we commanded,
110516 ^ so that you may walk properly toward those outside,
110522 ^ and of no one need may have.
110526 ^ not we do want but
110529 ^ you to be ignorant, brothers,
110532 ^ concerning those having fallen asleep,
110535 ^ so that not you should be grieved,
110538 ^ just as also the rest,
110542 ^ those not
110544 ^ having hope.
110546 ^ if for we believe
110549 ^ that jesus died
110552 ^ and rose again,
110554 ^ so also - god,
110558 ^ those having fallen asleep through - jesus, will bring with him.
110566 ^ this for to you we declare in [the] word of [the] lord,
110573 ^ that we
110575 ^ the living
110577 ^ - remaining, unto the coming of the lord no not shall precede
110587 ^ those having fallen asleep,
110589 ^ because himself the lord with a loud command, with the voice of an archangel, and with [the] trumpet of god, will descend from heaven,
110605 ^ and the dead in christ will rise first.
110612 ^ then we
110614 ^ the living
110616 ^ - remaining, together with them, will be caught away in [the] clouds for [the] meeting of the lord in [the] air;
110630 ^ and so always with [the] lord we will be.
110636 ^ therefore encourage one another with the words these.
110643 ^ concerning now
110645 ^ the times and the seasons, brothers, no need you have
110654 ^ to you to be written.
110656 ^ yourselves for fully you know
110660 ^ that [the] day of [the] lord, as a thief by night, in this manner comes.
110669 ^ for when they might say, peace and security,
110674 ^ then suddenly upon them comes destruction,
110679 ^ as the labor pains
110682 ^ to her in womb
110685 ^ having;
110686 ^ and no not shall they escape.
110690 ^ you however, brothers, not are in darkness,
110697 ^ that the day you like a thief should overtake.
110704 ^ all for
110706 ^ you, sons of light are,
110710 ^ and sons of day.
110713 ^ not we are of night nor of darkness.
110718 ^ so then not we should sleep as the others,
110725 ^ but we should watch
110727 ^ and we should be sober.
113597 ^ the deposit entrusted of me to guard for that - day.
113605 ^ [the] pattern retain
113607 ^ of sound words,
113609 ^ which from me you did hear, in [the] faith and love that [are] in christ jesus.
113621 ^ the good deposit entrusted [to you] keep, by [the] spirit holy,
113628 ^ the [one] dwelling in us.
113632 ^ you know this,
113634 ^ that turned away from me all those in - asia,
113642 ^ among whom are phygelus and hermogenes.
113647 ^ may grant mercy the lord to the of onesiphorus household,
113654 ^ because often me he refreshed,
113658 ^ and the chain of me not he was ashamed of.
113664 ^ but
113665 ^ having arrived in rome, earnestly he sought out me
113671 ^ and found [me].
113673 ^ may grant unto him the lord
113677 ^ to find mercy from [the] lord in that - day!
113685 ^ and
113686 ^ how much in ephesus he served very well, you know.
113693 ^ you therefore, child of me, be strong in the grace that [is] in christ jesus.
113705 ^ and the things which you have heard from me among many witnesses,
113713 ^ these entrust to faithful men,
113717 ^ such as sufficient will be
113720 ^ also others to teach.
113723 ^ share in suffering as [a] good soldier of christ jesus.
113729 ^ no one
113730 ^ serving as a soldier entangles himself in the of this life affairs,
113736 ^ that
113737 ^ the [one] having enlisted him, he might please.
113740 ^ if now also competes anyone,
113745 ^ not he is crowned,
113747 ^ if not lawfully he shall have competed.
114247 ^ - being able
114249 ^ you to make wise unto salvation, through faith, - in christ jesus.
114259 ^ every scripture [is] god-breathed and profitable for instruction, for conviction, for correction, [and] for training - in righteousness,
114275 ^ so that complete may be the - of god man,

114287 ^ i earnestly declare before - god and christ jesus,
114294 ^ the [one] being about
114296 ^ to judge
114297 ^ [the] living
115386 ^ to order you what [is] befitting, for the sake of - love, rather i exhort [you],
115395 ^ such a one being, as paul aged, now then also a prisoner of christ jesus.
115406 ^ i exhort you for - my child,
115412 ^ whom i have begotten in - chains, onesimus, - once to you useless, now however
115424 ^ both to you and to me useful,
115429 ^ whom i have sent back to you in person —
115433 ^ he who is - my very heart —
115438 ^ whom i was wishing
115441 ^ with myself to keep,
115444 ^ so that on behalf of you, me he might serve in the chains of the gospel.
115454 ^ apart from however
115456 ^ - your consent, nothing i wished
115461 ^ to do,
115462 ^ so that not as according to necessity, the good of you may be,
115471 ^ but according to willingness.
115474 ^ perhaps for because of this, he was separated [from you] for a time,
115481 ^ so that eternally him you might possess, no longer as a slave, but above a slave, a brother beloved, especially to me, how much however more
115498 ^ to you,
115499 ^ both in [the] flesh and in [the] lord.
115505 ^ if therefore me you consider a partner,
115510 ^ receive him as me.
115514 ^ if however in any way he has wronged you,
115519 ^ or he owes [you],
115521 ^ this to me charge.
115524 ^ i paul did write with my own hand.
115530 ^ i will repay [it];
115532 ^ that not i may say to you,
115536 ^ that even yourself to me you owe also.
115541 ^ yes, brother,
115543 ^ i from you may have profit in [the] lord.
115548 ^ refresh my - heart in christ.
116931 ^ [one] to teach you what [is] the principles of the beginning of the oracles - of god;
116943 ^ and you have become
116945 ^ need [those] having
116947 ^ of milk,
116948 ^ and not of solid food.
116977 ^ for distinguishing good both and evil.
116983 ^ therefore,
116984 ^ having left the - beginning of the christ teaching, to - maturity we should go on,
116995 ^ not again a foundation laying
116999 ^ of repentance from dead works, and faith in god, about baptisms instruction, of laying on then of hands, of [the] resurrection both of [the] dead and of judgment eternal.
117018 ^ and this we will do,
117021 ^ if permits - god.
117025 ^ [it is] impossible for
117027 ^ to those once
117029 ^ having been enlightened,
117030 ^ having tasted then of the gift - heavenly,
117036 ^ and partakers having become
117039 ^ of [the] spirit holy,
117041 ^ and [the] goodness having tasted
117044 ^ of god’s word, [the] power also
117048 ^ [of the] coming age —
117050 ^ and then having fallen away — again to restore [them] to repentance,
117056 ^ crucifying in themselves the son - of god
117062 ^ and subjecting [him] to open shame.
117064 ^ land for
117066 ^ - having drunk in the
117069 ^ upon it coming often rain,
117074 ^ and producing vegetation useful for those
117079 ^ for the sake of whom also it is tilled, partakes of blessing from - god.
117160 ^ of those through faith and patience
117165 ^ inheriting the promises.
117375 ^ to take a tenth from the people according to the law,
117381 ^ that is, from the brothers of them,
117386 ^ though having come out of the loin of abraham.
117724 ^ having weakness;
117726 ^ the word however
117729 ^ of the oath, which [is] after the law, a son
117736 ^ to the age, having been perfected.
117740 ^ [the] sum now
117742 ^ of the things being spoken of [is that]
117745 ^ such we have,
117747 ^ a high priest
117748 ^ who sat down at [the] right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens,
117759 ^ in the holy places a minister,
117762 ^ and in the tabernacle - true,
117767 ^ which has pitched the lord,
117771 ^ not man.
117773 ^ every for
117775 ^ high priest,
117776 ^ in order - to offer gifts both, and sacrifices, is appointed;
117784 ^ wherefore [it was] necessary
117786 ^ to have something also [for] this one
117790 ^ that he might offer.
117792 ^ if certainly then he were on earth,
117798 ^ not even - would he be a priest,
117802 ^ there being
117803 ^ those offering according to law the gifts,
117809 ^ who a copy and shadow serve
117814 ^ of the heavenly,
117816 ^ as was divinely instructed moses,
117819 ^ being about
117820 ^ to complete the tabernacle.
117823 ^ see that,” for
117825 ^ he says,
117826 ^ you shall make all things according to the pattern
117831 ^ - having been shown you in the mountain.”
117837 ^ now, however, more excellent he has obtained
117841 ^ a ministry,
117842 ^ as much as also of a better he is
117846 ^ covenant [the] mediator,
117848 ^ which upon better promises has been enacted.
117853 ^ if for the first that had been faultless,
117860 ^ not - for a second would have been sought
117864 ^ a place.
118196 ^ having appeared as high priest of the having come good things, by the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made by hands,
118209 ^ that is, not of this - creation,
118215 ^ nor by blood of goats and calves, through however
118223 ^ the own blood, he entered once for all into the holy places,
118231 ^ eternal redemption having obtained.
118234 ^ if for the blood of goats, and of bulls, and [the] ashes of a heifer,
118244 ^ sprinkling
118245 ^ the having been defiled, sanctify [them] for the of the flesh purification,
118253 ^ how much more the blood - of christ,
118259 ^ who through [the] spirit eternal, himself offered unblemished - to god, will purify the conscience of us from dead works,
118275 ^ in order - to serve god
118279 ^ [the] living!
118280 ^ and because of this, of a covenant new [the] mediator he is,
118287 ^ so that,
118288 ^ death having taken place, for redemption of the under the first covenant transgressions, the promise might receive
118301 ^ those having been called,
118303 ^ of the eternal inheritance.
118306 ^ where for [there is] a will,
118584 ^ to take away sins.
118586 ^ therefore
118587 ^ coming into the world, he says:
118592 ^ sacrifice and offering not you have desired,
118597 ^ a body however you have prepared me.
118601 ^ burnt offerings and [offerings] for sin not you have delighted in.
118607 ^ then i said,
118609 ^ behold,
118610 ^ i have come —
118611 ^ in [the] scroll of [the] book it is written of me —
118617 ^ - to do, - o god, the will of you.’”
118624 ^ above saying
118626 ^ -, sacrifice, and offering, and burnt offerings, and [offerings] for sin, not you have desired,
118637 ^ nor have you delighted in,”
118639 ^ which according to [the] law are offered; then he said,
118645 ^ behold,
118646 ^ i have come
118647 ^ - to do the will of you.
118652 ^ he takes away the first,
118655 ^ that the second he might establish.
118659 ^ by that will,
118662 ^ having been sanctified we are, through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all.
118672 ^ and every indeed
118675 ^ priest stands every day
118679 ^ ministering,
118680 ^ and the same repeatedly offering
118685 ^ sacrifices,
118686 ^ which never are able
118689 ^ to take away sins.
118691 ^ this [one] however,
118693 ^ one for sins having offered
118697 ^ sacrifice in - perpetuity, sat down at [the] right hand - of god,
118706 ^ the henceforth
118708 ^ awaiting
118709 ^ until should be placed the enemies of him [as] a footstool for the feet of him.
118718 ^ by one for
118720 ^ offering, he has perfected for - all time
118725 ^ those being sanctified.
118727 ^ bears witness now to us also the spirit - holy;
118735 ^ after for
118737 ^ - having said:
118739 ^ this [is] the covenant
118742 ^ that i will make with them, after the days those,
118750 ^ says [the] lord,
118935 ^ by which he was sanctified,
118938 ^ and the spirit - of grace having insulted?
118944 ^ we know for
118946 ^ the [one] having said,
118948 ^ mine [is] vengeance ;
118950 ^ i will repay,”
118952 ^ and again,
118954 ^ will judge [the] lord the people of him.”
118959 ^ [it is] a fearful thing
118960 ^ - to fall into [the] hands of god
118965 ^ [the] living.
118966 ^ remember however the former days
118971 ^ in which,
118973 ^ having been enlightened, a great conflict you endured
118977 ^ of sufferings,
118978 ^ this indeed,
118980 ^ by revilings both and tribulations being made a spectacle;
118985 ^ this now,
118987 ^ partners
118988 ^ of those thus
118990 ^ passing through [them] having become.
118992 ^ both for with the prisoners you sympathized,
118997 ^ and the plundering
119000 ^ of the possessions of you with joy you accepted,
119006 ^ knowing
119007 ^ to have yourselves a better possession,
119011 ^ and abiding.
119013 ^ not throw away therefore the boldness of you,
119019 ^ which has a great reward.
119023 ^ of endurance for you have
119026 ^ need,
119027 ^ so that,
119028 ^ the will - of god having done, you may receive the promise.
119036 ^ yet for, a little very while,
119041 ^ the [one] coming will come,
119044 ^ and not will delay.
119047 ^ the one however
119049 ^ righteous of mine by faith will live;
119054 ^ and if he might shrink back,
119057 ^ not takes pleasure the soul of me in him.”
119064 ^ we however not are of [those] drawing back to destruction,
119071 ^ but of faith to [the] preserving [of the] soul.
119076 ^ is now faith
119079 ^ of [things] hoped for [the] assurance,
119081 ^ of things [the] conviction
119083 ^ not being seen.
119085 ^ in this for were commended the ancients.
119091 ^ by faith we understand
119093 ^ to have been formed the universe by [the] word of god,
119098 ^ so that which not
119101 ^ from [things] being visible,
119103 ^ the things being seen
119105 ^ have been made.
119106 ^ by faith a more excellent sacrifice abel
119110 ^ than cain offered - to god,
119115 ^ through which he was testified
119118 ^ to be righteous,
119120 ^ bearing witness to the gifts of him - god;
119127 ^ and through it,
119130 ^ having died, still he speaks.
119133 ^ by faith enoch was translated,
119136 ^ - not
119138 ^ to see death;
119140 ^ and not was he found,
119143 ^ because had taken up him - god.
119148 ^ before for
119150 ^ the translation, he was commended
119153 ^ to have pleased - god.
119156 ^ without now
119158 ^ faith, [it is] impossible
119160 ^ to please [him].
119161 ^ to believe for it behooves
119281 ^ having been as good as dead, as the stars of heaven - in multitude, and as the sand - by the shore of the sea - countless.
119301 ^ in faith died these all,
119306 ^ not having received the promises,
119310 ^ but from afar them having seen,
119314 ^ and having embraced [them],
119316 ^ and having confessed
119318 ^ that strangers and sojourners they are on the earth.
119339 ^ from where they came out,
119342 ^ they would have had - opportunity
119345 ^ to return.
119346 ^ now however a better [one] they stretch forward to,
119350 ^ that is, a heavenly [one].
119353 ^ therefore not is ashamed of them - god,
119359 ^ god to be called
119361 ^ of them;
119362 ^ he has prepared indeed for them a city.
119366 ^ by faith has offered up abraham - isaac.
119371 ^ being tested,
119372 ^ even [his] only begotten son was offering up
119376 ^ the [one] the promises
119379 ^ having received,
119380 ^ as to whom it was said
119383 ^ -, in isaac will be reckoned your offspring,”
119389 ^ having reasoned
119390 ^ that even
119392 ^ out from [the] dead to raise , able [was] - god,
119398 ^ from where him also in a simile, he received. by faith
119405 ^ also
119406 ^ concerning [the things] coming, blessed isaac - jacob and - esau.
119415 ^ by faith jacob,
119417 ^ dying, each of the sons of joseph blessed,
119423 ^ and worshiped on the top of the staff of him.
119431 ^ by faith joseph,
119433 ^ dying, concerning the exodus of the sons of israel made mention,
119441 ^ and concerning the bones of him gave instructions.
119447 ^ by faith moses,
119449 ^ having been born, was hidden three months by the parents of him,
119456 ^ because they saw [was] beautiful the little child,
119461 ^ and not they did fear the edict of the king.
119468 ^ by faith moses,
119470 ^ grown having become, refused
119473 ^ to be called [the] son of [the] daughter of pharaoh,
119477 ^ rather having chosen
119479 ^ to suffer affliction with the people - of god
119484 ^ than [the] temporary to have
119487 ^ of sin enjoyment,
119489 ^ greater wealth having esteemed
119492 ^ than the of egypt treasures the reproach - of christ;
119499 ^ he was looking for toward the reward.
119504 ^ by faith he left egypt,
119507 ^ not having feared the anger of the king;
119513 ^ the for
119515 ^ invisible [one]
119516 ^ as seeing, he persevered.
119519 ^ by faith he has kept the passover and the sprinkling of the blood,
119528 ^ so that not
119530 ^ the [one] destroying the firstborn would touch them.
119536 ^ by faith they passed through the red sea,
119541 ^ as through dry land,
120146 ^ yet once [more], signifies the
120150 ^ of the [things] being shaken removing,
120153 ^ as having been created,
120155 ^ so that should remain
120157 ^ the things not
120159 ^ being shaken.
120160 ^ therefore
120161 ^ a kingdom not to be shaken receiving, we may have grace,
120166 ^ by which we may serve well pleasingly - god, with reverence and awe.
120176 ^ also for the god of us [is] a fire
120182 ^ consuming.
120183 ^ - brotherly love let abide.
120186 ^ - of hospitality not be forgetful;
120190 ^ through this for, unawares some
120195 ^ have entertained angels.
120197 ^ remember - prisoners
120200 ^ as being bound with [them],
120311 ^ from which to eat, not have
120316 ^ authority,
120317 ^ those in the tabernacle
120320 ^ serving.
120321 ^ whose for is brought
120324 ^ of animals the blood [as sacrifices] for sin, into the holy places by the high priest;
120335 ^ of those the bodies are burned outside the camp.
120342 ^ therefore also jesus,
120345 ^ so that he might sanctify by the own blood the people, outside the gate suffered.
120357 ^ therefore we should go forth to him outside the camp,
120364 ^ the reproach of him bearing.
120368 ^ not for we have here
120372 ^ an abiding city,
120374 ^ but
120375 ^ the coming [one] we are seeking for.
120378 ^ through him then we should offer [the] sacrifice of praise through everything to god,
120388 ^ that is, [the] fruit of [the] lips
120392 ^ confessing the name of him.
120396 ^ - and
120398 ^ the good and of sharing, not be forgetful;
120403 ^ with such for
120405 ^ sacrifices is well pleased - god.
120409 ^ obey
120410 ^ those leading you,
120413 ^ and be submissive;
120415 ^ they for watch over the souls of you,
120422 ^ as account
120424 ^ about to give;
120425 ^ that with joy this they might do,
120430 ^ and not
120432 ^ groaning,
120433 ^ unprofitable indeed
120435 ^ for you [is] this.
120437 ^ pray for us;
120440 ^ we are persuaded for
120442 ^ that a good conscience we have,
121877 ^ - judging the neighbor?
121881 ^ come now,
121883 ^ those saying,
121885 ^ today or tomorrow we will go into such - city,
121893 ^ and will spend there a year,
121897 ^ and will trade,
121899 ^ and will make a profit,
121901 ^ who not know what [is]
121905 ^ on the next day [is]. what [is] the life of you?
121911 ^ a vapor just it is,
121914 ^ - for a little [while]
121917 ^ appearing,
121918 ^ then also vanishing.
124305 ^ from heaven, having been brought
124308 ^ with him, being in the holy mountain.
124315 ^ and we have more certain the prophetic word,
124321 ^ to which well you do
124324 ^ taking heed, as to a lamp
124327 ^ shining in [a] dark place,
124331 ^ until this day shall have dawned
124335 ^ and [the] morning star shall have arisen in the hearts of you,
124342 ^ this first knowing,
124345 ^ that any prophecy of scripture of its own interpretation not is.
124353 ^ not for by [the] will of man was brought prophecy at any time,
124360 ^ but
124361 ^ by [the] spirit holy being carried, spoke from god men.
124369 ^ there were however also false prophets among the people,
124376 ^ as also among you there will be false teachers,
124382 ^ who will stealthily introduce heresies destructive,
124386 ^ even
124387 ^ the
124388 ^ having bought them master denying,
124392 ^ bringing upon themselves swift destruction.
124396 ^ and many will follow after their - sensuality,
124402 ^ through whom the way of the truth will be maligned.
124409 ^ and through covetousness with fabricated words you they will exploit,
124416 ^ for whom the judgment of long ago not is idle,
124422 ^ and the destruction of them not slumbers.
124428 ^ if for - god [the] angels
124433 ^ having sinned, not spared,
124436 ^ but in chains of gloomy darkness
124439 ^ having cast [them] down to tartarus, delivered [them],
124441 ^ for judgment being kept;
124444 ^ and [the] ancient world not he spared,
124449 ^ but one of eight, noah of righteousness a herald preserved,
124455 ^ [the] flood upon [the] world of [the] ungodly having brought in;
124459 ^ and [the] cities of sodom and gomorrah
124464 ^ having reduced to ashes, to destruction he condemned [them],
124467 ^ an example
124468 ^ of what is coming on
124469 ^ the ungodly having set;
124471 ^ and righteous lot,
124474 ^ being distressed by the of the lawless in sensuality conduct, he rescued —
124483 ^ through seeing for
124485 ^ and hearing that righteous [man],
124489 ^ dwelling among them day after day, in [his] soul righteous with [their] lawless deeds was tormented —
124500 ^ [then] knows [the] lord
124502 ^ [the] devout out of temptation to deliver;
124506 ^ [the] unrighteous then unto [the] day of judgment
124511 ^ being punished to keep;
124513 ^ especially then

124521 ^ walking
124522 ^ and authority despising.

127058 ^ to those believing in the name of the son - of god.
127067 ^ and this is the confidence
127072 ^ that we have toward him,
127076 ^ that if anything we might ask according to the will of him,
127084 ^ he hears us.
127086 ^ and if we know
127089 ^ that he hears us,
127092 ^ whatever if we might ask,
127095 ^ we know
127096 ^ that we have the requests

129853 ^ and out of the throne come flashes of lightning, and voices, and thunderings.
129863 ^ and [there were] seven lamps of fire
129867 ^ burning before the throne,
129871 ^ which are the seven spirits - of god.
129878 ^ and before the throne [was something] like a sea of glass, like crystal.
129887 ^ and in [the] midst of the throne and around the throne [were] four living creatures,
129898 ^ being full of eyes in front and behind.
129903 ^ and the living creature - first [was] like a lion,

129920 ^ having the face as of a man,
129925 ^ and the fourth living creature like an eagle

130113 ^ because no one worthy was found
130117 ^ to open the scroll,
130120 ^ nor to see it.
130123 ^ and one of the elders says to me,
130130 ^ not do weep.
130132 ^ behold,
130133 ^ has overcome the lion - of the tribe of judah, the root of david,
130144 ^ to open the scroll and the seven seals of it.
130152 ^ and i saw in [the] midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in [the] midst of the elders, a lamb
130168 ^ standing
130169 ^ as having been slain,
130171 ^ having horns seven and eyes seven,
130177 ^ which are the seven spirits - of god,

130201 ^ and when he had taken the scroll,
130206 ^ the four living creatures and the twenty four elders fell down before the lamb,
130218 ^ having each a harp and bowls golden
130224 ^ being full of incenses,
130226 ^ which are the prayers of the saints.
130232 ^ and they are singing a song new,

130237 ^ worthy are you
130239 ^ to take the scroll,
130242 ^ and to open the seals of it,
130247 ^ because you were slain,
130249 ^ and you purchased - to god by the blood of you, out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation,
130266 ^ and you have made them to the god of us, a kingdom and priests;
130275 ^ and they will reign upon the earth.
130280 ^ and i looked,
130282 ^ and i heard [the] voice of angels many around the throne, and of the living creatures, and of the elders;
130296 ^ and was the number of them myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands,
130315 ^ to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing!
130330 ^ and every creature
130333 ^ which [is] in - heaven, and upon the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea and - in them everything, i heard
130355 ^ saying:
130356 ^ to the [one] sitting on the throne, and to the lamb, - blessing and - honor and - glory and - might to the ages of the ages.
130380 ^ and the four living creatures kept saying,
130385 ^ amen.
130386 ^ and the elders fell down
130390 ^ and worshiped.
130392 ^ and i watched
130394 ^ when opened the lamb one of the seven seals,
130403 ^ and i heard one of the four living creatures
130410 ^ saying, like a voice of thunder,
130414 ^ come!
130415 ^ and i looked,
130417 ^ and behold,
130419 ^ a horse white,
130421 ^ and
130422 ^ the [one] sitting on it
130426 ^ having a bow;
130428 ^ and was given to him a crown,
130432 ^ and he went forth
130434 ^ overcoming,
130435 ^ and that he might conquer.
130438 ^ and when he opened the seal - second,
130445 ^ i heard the second living creature
130449 ^ saying,
130450 ^ come!
130451 ^ and went forth another horse bright red;
130456 ^ and
130457 ^ to the [one] sitting on it
130461 ^ was granted to him
130463 ^ to take the peace from the earth,
130469 ^ and that one another they will slay;
130473 ^ and was given to him a sword great.
130478 ^ and when he opened the seal - third,
130485 ^ i heard the third living creature
130489 ^ saying,
130490 ^ come!
130491 ^ and i looked,
130493 ^ and behold,
130495 ^ a horse black,
130497 ^ and
130498 ^ the [one] sitting on it
130502 ^ having a pair of scales in the hand of him.
130508 ^ and i heard
130510 ^ [something] like a voice in [the] midst of the four living creatures, saying,
130518 ^ a choenix of wheat for a denarius,
130521 ^ and three choenixes of barley for a denarius;
130526 ^ and the oil and the wine not you should injure.
130534 ^ and when he opened the seal - fourth,
130541 ^ i heard [the] voice of the fourth living creature
130546 ^ saying,
130547 ^ come!
130548 ^ and i looked,
130550 ^ and behold,
130552 ^ a horse pale,
130554 ^ and
130555 ^ the [one] sitting on it,
130559 ^ [the] name of him [was] - death,
130563 ^ and - hades was following with him;
130569 ^ and was given to them authority over the fourth of the earth,
130578 ^ to kill with sword, and with famine, and with plague, and by the beasts of the earth.
130593 ^ and when he opened the fifth seal,
130599 ^ i saw under the altar the souls
130605 ^ of those having been slain because of the word - of god, and because of the testimony
130616 ^ which they had upheld.
130618 ^ and they were crying in a voice loud,
130622 ^ saying,
130623 ^ until when, o lord, - holy and true, not do you judge,
130633 ^ and avenge the blood of us
130638 ^ from those dwelling upon the earth?
130644 ^ and were given to them each robes white,
130650 ^ and it was said to them
130653 ^ that they shall rest yet a time little,
130658 ^ until would be fulfilled also the fellow servants of them, and the brothers of them,
130668 ^ those being about
130670 ^ to be killed
130671 ^ as also [had been] they.
130674 ^ and i saw
130676 ^ when he opened the seal - sixth,
130682 ^ and an earthquake great there was,
130686 ^ and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair,
130694 ^ and the moon whole became like blood,
130701 ^ and the stars of heaven fell to the earth,
130710 ^ as a fig tree casts the unripe figs of it,
130716 ^ by a wind great being shaken.
130720 ^ and - heaven departed like a scroll
130726 ^ being rolled up,
130727 ^ and every mountain and island out of the places of them were moved.
130737 ^ and the kings of the earth, and the great ones, and the commanders, and the rich, and the powerful, and every slave and free, hid themselves in the caves, and among the rocks of the mountains.
130770 ^ and they say to the mountains and to the rocks,
130777 ^ fall on us
130780 ^ and hide us from [the] face
130785 ^ of the [one] sitting on the throne, and from the wrath of the lamb,
130796 ^ because has come the day - great of the wrath of them,
130805 ^ and who is able
130808 ^ to stand?
130809 ^ after these things i saw four angels
130814 ^ standing upon the four corners of the earth,
130821 ^ holding the four winds of the earth,
130827 ^ so that no would blow wind on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.
130842 ^ and i saw another angel,
130846 ^ having ascended from [the] rising of [the] sun,
130850 ^ having [the] seal of god
130853 ^ [the] living.
130854 ^ and he cried in a voice loud to the four angels
130861 ^ to whom it had been given to them
130864 ^ to harm the earth and the sea,
130870 ^ saying,
130871 ^ not harm the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees,
130881 ^ until we shall have sealed the servants of the god of us, on the foreheads of them.
130892 ^ and i heard the number
130896 ^ of those having been sealed,
130898 ^ one hundred forty four thousand,
130902 ^ having been sealed out of every tribe of [the] sons of israel:
134160 ^ - having authority over the fire,
134166 ^ and he called in a voice loud
134170 ^ to the [one] having the sickle - sharp,
134176 ^ saying,
134177 ^ put forth your - sickle - sharp,
134183 ^ and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth,
134191 ^ because have fully ripened the grapes of it.
134196 ^ and put forth the angel the sickle of him to the earth,
134206 ^ and gathered the vine of the earth,
134212 ^ and cast [them] into the winepress of the wrath - of god - great.
134223 ^ and was trodden the winepress outside the city,
134230 ^ and flowed blood out of the winepress, as high as the bridles of the horses, to the distance of stadia one thousand six hundred.
134245 ^ and i saw another sign in - heaven,
134252 ^ great and wonderful, angels seven
134257 ^ having plagues seven — the last,
134262 ^ because in them was completed the wrath - of god.
134270 ^ and i saw [something] like a sea of glass
134275 ^ mingled with fire,
134277 ^ and those conquering over the beast, and of the image of it, and over the number of the name of it,
134295 ^ standing upon the sea of the glass,
134301 ^ having harps - of god.
134305 ^ and they are singing the song of moses, the servant of god, and the song of the lamb,
134319 ^ saying:
134320 ^ great and wonderful [are] the works of you, lord - god the almighty!
134331 ^ righteous and true [are] the ways of you, o king of the nations!
134341 ^ who no not should fear [you], o lord,
134346 ^ and will glorify the name of you?
134351 ^ for [you] alone [are] holy.
134354 ^ for all the nations will come
134359 ^ and will worship before you,
134363 ^ because the righteous acts of you have been revealed.
134368 ^ and after these things i looked,
134372 ^ and was opened the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in - heaven.
134383 ^ and came forth the seven angels
134388 ^ - having the seven plagues out of the temple,
134396 ^ having been clothed in linen pure bright,
134400 ^ and having been girded with around the chests sashes golden.
134407 ^ and one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven bowls golden
134420 ^ full of the wrath - of god,
134425 ^ the [one] living to the ages of the ages.
134432 ^ and was filled the temple with smoke from the glory - of god, and from the power of him;
134447 ^ and no one was able
134450 ^ to enter into the temple
134454 ^ until were completed the seven plagues of the seven angels.
134462 ^ and i heard [a] loud voice
134466 ^ from the temple saying to the seven angels,
134473 ^ go
134474 ^ and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath - of god into the earth.
134486 ^ and departed the first,
134490 ^ and poured out the bowl of him into the earth;
134498 ^ and came a sore, evil and grievous, upon the men
134507 ^ - having the mark of the beast
134513 ^ and those worshiping the image of it.
134519 ^ and the second poured out the bowl of him into the sea,
134529 ^ and it became blood, as of [one] dead;
134534 ^ and every soul living died
134539 ^ that was in the sea.
134543 ^ and the third poured out the bowl of him into the rivers and the springs of the waters,
134558 ^ and they became blood.
134561 ^ and i heard the angel of the waters
134567 ^ saying:
134568 ^ righteous are you,
134570 ^ the [one] being,
134572 ^ and - having been, o holy one,
134577 ^ because these things you have judged,
134580 ^ because [the] blood of saints and of prophets they have poured out,
134586 ^ and
134587 ^ blood to them you have given to drink;
134591 ^ worthy they are.
134593 ^ and i heard the altar
134597 ^ saying:
134598 ^ yes, lord - god - almighty,
134604 ^ true and righteous [are] the judgments of you.
134610 ^ and the fourth poured out the bowl of him upon the sun,
134620 ^ and there was given to it
134623 ^ to scorch - men with fire.
134628 ^ and were scorched the men with heat great,
134634 ^ and they cursed the name - of god,
134640 ^ the [one] having - authority over the plagues these;
134648 ^ and not did they repent
134651 ^ to give him glory.
134654 ^ and the fifth poured out the bowl of him upon the throne of the beast,
134666 ^ and became the kingdom of it
134671 ^ darkened,
134672 ^ and they were gnawing the tongues of them for the distress,
134680 ^ and they cursed the god of heaven on account of the distresses of them, and on account of the sores of them;
134695 ^ and not they did repent of the works of them.
134702 ^ and the sixth poured out the bowl of him upon the river - great - euphrates,
134716 ^ and was dried up the water of it,
134721 ^ so that might be prepared the way of the kings - of the rising of the sun.
134731 ^ and i saw [coming] out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, spirits three unclean, like frogs;
134755 ^ they are for spirits of demons
134759 ^ performing signs,
134761 ^ which go forth to the kings of the inhabited [world] whole,
134769 ^ to gather together them unto the battle of the day - great - of god the almighty.
134782 ^ behold,
134783 ^ i am coming like a thief.
134786 ^ blessed [is]
134787 ^ the [one] watching
134789 ^ and keeping the garments of him,
134794 ^ so that not naked he should walk
134798 ^ and they might see the shame of him.
134803 ^ and he gathered together them unto the place
134809 ^ - called in hebrew armageddon.
134813 ^ and the seventh poured out the bowl of him upon the air,
134823 ^ and came out a voice loud from the temple from the throne,
134833 ^ saying,
134834 ^ it is done!
134835 ^ and there were flashes of lightning, and voices, and thunders;
134842 ^ and an earthquake there was
134845 ^ great,
134846 ^ such as not had there been
134849 ^ since - men were upon the earth,
134856 ^ so great [was the] earthquake,
134858 ^ so mighty.
134860 ^ and was [split] the city - great into three parts,
134869 ^ and the cities of the nations fell;
134875 ^ and babylon the great was remembered before - god,
134883 ^ to give her the cup of the wine of the fury the wrath of him.
134894 ^ and every island fled,
134898 ^ and mountains not were to be found.
134902 ^ and a hail great, about a talent weight, comes down out of - heaven upon the men.
134914 ^ and blasphemed the men - god on account of the plague of the hail,
134925 ^ for severe is the plague of it exceedingly.
134932 ^ and came one of the seven angels
134939 ^ - having the seven bowls,
134944 ^ and spoke with me,
134948 ^ saying,
134949 ^ come here,
134950 ^ i will show you the punishment of the prostitute - great,
134958 ^ the [one] sitting upon waters many,
134963 ^ with whom have committed sexual immorality the kings of the earth,
134970 ^ and have been made drunk
134972 ^ those that dwelling on the earth with the wine of the sexual immorality of her.
134982 ^ and he carried away me into a wilderness in [the] spirit,
134989 ^ and i saw a woman
134992 ^ sitting upon a beast scarlet,
134996 ^ being full of names of blasphemy,
134999 ^ having heads seven and horns ten.
135005 ^ and the woman was
135009 ^ clothed in purple and scarlet,
135013 ^ and
135014 ^ adorned with gold and stone precious and pearls,
135021 ^ holding a cup golden in the hand of her,
135028 ^ being full of abominations and the impurity of the sexual immorality of her.
135036 ^ and upon the forehead of her a name
135042 ^ was written, a mystery: babylon the great, the mother of the prostitutes, and of the abominations of the earth.
135056 ^ and i saw the woman
135060 ^ being drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of jesus.
135073 ^ and i marveled,
135075 ^ having seen her, with wonder great.
135079 ^ and said to me the angel,
135084 ^ because of why did you marvel?
135087 ^ i will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast
135097 ^ - carrying her,
135100 ^ - having the seven heads, and the ten horns.
135109 ^ the beast
135111 ^ that you saw was,
135114 ^ and not is,
135117 ^ and is about
135119 ^ to come up out of the abyss
135123 ^ and into destruction go;
135127 ^ and will wonder
135129 ^ those dwelling on the earth,
135134 ^ whose not are written
135137 ^ - names in the book - of life from [the] foundation of [the] world,
135147 ^ seeing the beast
135150 ^ which was,
