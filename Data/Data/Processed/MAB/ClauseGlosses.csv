302 ^ joseph now,

349 ^ she will bear then a son,
352 ^ and you will call the name of him jesus;
358 ^ he for will save the people of him from the sins of them.
368 ^ this then
370 ^ all has come to pass,
372 ^ that may be fulfilled
374 ^ that having been spoken by the lord through the prophet,
381 ^ saying,
382 ^ behold,
383 ^ the virgin in womb will hold,
388 ^ and will bear a son,
391 ^ and they will call the name of him immanuel,”
397 ^ which is
399 ^ being translated,
400 ^ with us - god.
404 ^ having been awoken then - joseph from the sleep, he did
412 ^ as had commanded him the angel of [the] lord,
418 ^ and received the wife of him,
423 ^ and not knew her
427 ^ until that she had brought forth a son;
431 ^ and he called the name of him jesus.
437 ^ - now
439 ^ jesus having been born in bethlehem - of judea, in [the] days of herod the king,
450 ^ behold,
451 ^ magi from [the] east arrived in jerusalem,
457 ^ saying,
458 ^ where is the [one]
461 ^ having been born king of the jews?
465 ^ we saw for of him the star in the east,
473 ^ and are come
475 ^ to worship him.
477 ^ having heard then - king herod, he was troubled,
483 ^ and all jerusalem with him.
488 ^ and
489 ^ having gathered together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he was inquiring of them
500 ^ where the christ was to be born.
504 ^ - and they said to him,
508 ^ in bethlehem - of judea,
512 ^ thus for has it been written through the prophet:
518 ^ and you, bethlehem, land of judah, by no means least are among the rulers of judah,
530 ^ out of you for will go forth
534 ^ [one] leading,
535 ^ who will shepherd the people of me - israel.’
542 ^ then herod,
544 ^ secretly having called the magi, inquired exactly of them the time of the
554 ^ appearing star.
556 ^ and
557 ^ having sent them to bethlehem, he said,
562 ^ having gone, search carefully for the child;
568 ^ when then you shall have found [him],
571 ^ bring word back to me,
573 ^ so that i also
575 ^ having come, may worship him.
578 ^ - and
580 ^ having heard the king, they went away;
584 ^ and behold,
586 ^ the star
588 ^ which they saw in the east went before them
595 ^ until
596 ^ having arrived, it stood
598 ^ over where was the child.
603 ^ having seen now the star, they rejoiced [with] joy great exceedingly.
611 ^ and
612 ^ having come into the house, they found the child with mary the mother of him,
624 ^ and
625 ^ having fallen down, they worshiped him;
628 ^ and
629 ^ having opened the treasures of them, they offered to him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.
641 ^ and
642 ^ having been divinely warned in a dream
645 ^ not to return to herod, by another route they withdrew into the country of them.
657 ^ having withdrawn then of them,
660 ^ behold,
661 ^ an angel of [the] lord appears in a dream - to joseph,
668 ^ saying,
669 ^ having arisen, take the child and the mother of him,
677 ^ and flee into egypt,
681 ^ and remain there
684 ^ until - i should tell you;
688 ^ is about for herod
691 ^ to seek the child,
694 ^ - to destroy him.
697 ^ - and
699 ^ having arisen, he took the child and the mother of him by night
708 ^ and withdrew into egypt,
712 ^ and he remained there until the death of herod;
719 ^ so that it might be fulfilled
721 ^ that having been spoken by [the] lord through the prophet,
728 ^ saying,
729 ^ out of egypt have i called the son of me.”
735 ^ then herod,
737 ^ having seen
738 ^ that he had been outwitted by the magi, was enraged intensely,
745 ^ and
746 ^ having sent forth, he put to death all the boys that [were] in bethlehem and in all the vicinity of it, from two years old and under, according to the time
767 ^ which he had ascertained from the magi.
772 ^ then was fulfilled
774 ^ that having been spoken by jeremiah the prophet,
780 ^ saying,
781 ^ a voice in ramah was heard,
785 ^ weeping and mourning great,
789 ^ rachel weeping [for] the children of her,
794 ^ and not would
797 ^ be comforted,
798 ^ because no more are they.”
801 ^ having died now - of herod,
805 ^ behold,
806 ^ an angel of [the] lord appears in a dream to joseph in egypt,
815 ^ saying,
816 ^ having arisen, take the child and the mother of him,
824 ^ and go into [the] land of israel;
829 ^ they have died for
831 ^ those seeking the life of the child.
837 ^ - and having arisen, he took the child and the mother of him
847 ^ and came into [the] land of israel.
852 ^ having heard now
854 ^ that archelaus reigns over - judea in place of the father of him herod, he was afraid
865 ^ there to go;
867 ^ having been divinely warned now in a dream, he withdrew into the district - of galilee,
877 ^ and
878 ^ having come, he dwelt in a city
882 ^ being called nazareth;
884 ^ so that it should be fulfilled
886 ^ that having been spoken through the prophets,
891 ^ that a nazarene he will be called.
894 ^ in then
896 ^ the days those, comes john the baptist,
903 ^ preaching in the wilderness - of judea,
909 ^ and saying,
911 ^ repent;
912 ^ has drawn near for the kingdom of the heavens.
918 ^ this for is
921 ^ the [one] having been spoken of through isaiah the prophet,
927 ^ saying,
928 ^ [the] voice
929 ^ of one crying in the wilderness,
933 ^ prepare the way of [the] lord;
937 ^ straight make the paths of him.’”
942 ^ himself now
944 ^ - john had the garment of him of hair of a camel,
953 ^ and a belt of leather around the waist of him,
960 ^ - and
962 ^ the food was
964 ^ of him locusts and honey wild.
969 ^ at that time were going out to him jerusalem,
974 ^ and all - judea, and all the region around the jordan,
984 ^ and were being baptized in the jordan river by him,
992 ^ confessing the sins of them.
996 ^ having seen now many of the pharisees and sadducees
1003 ^ coming to the baptism of him, he said to them,
1010 ^ brood of vipers, who forewarned you
1015 ^ to flee from the
1018 ^ coming wrath?
1020 ^ produce therefore fruit worthy - of repentance.
1026 ^ and not presume
1029 ^ to say within yourselves,
1032 ^ [as] father we have - abraham.
1036 ^ i say for to you
1039 ^ that able is - god
1043 ^ out of the stones these to raise up children unto abraham.
1051 ^ already now the ax to the root of the trees is applied;
1061 ^ every therefore
1063 ^ tree
1064 ^ not producing fruit good is cut down
1069 ^ and into [the] fire is thrown.
1073 ^ i indeed you baptize with water to repentance,
1081 ^ - but after me is coming mightier than i, he
1089 ^ of whom not i am fit
1093 ^ the sandals to carry.
1096 ^ he you will baptize with [the] spirit holy and with fire,
1104 ^ whose - winnowing fork [is] in the hand of him;
1111 ^ and he will clear the threshing floor of him
1116 ^ and will gather the wheat of him into the barn;
1124 ^ the but
1126 ^ chaff he will burn up with fire unquenchable.
1130 ^ then comes - jesus from - galilee to the jordan, unto - john,
1143 ^ - to be baptized by him.
1147 ^ - but
1149 ^ john was hindering him,
1152 ^ saying,
1153 ^ i need have
1156 ^ by you to be baptized,
1159 ^ and you come to me?
1164 ^ answering, however, - jesus said unto him,
1171 ^ permit [it] presently;
1173 ^ thus for fitting it is to us
1178 ^ to fulfill all righteousness.
1181 ^ then he permits him.
1184 ^ having been baptized now, - jesus immediately went up from the water;
1193 ^ and behold,
1195 ^ were opened to him the heavens,
1199 ^ and he saw the spirit of god
1205 ^ descending as a dove,
1208 ^ and alighting upon him.
1212 ^ and behold,
1214 ^ a voice out of the heavens,
1218 ^ saying,
1219 ^ this is the son of me, the beloved,
1226 ^ in whom i was well pleased.
1229 ^ then - jesus was led up into the wilderness by the spirit
1239 ^ to be tempted by the devil.
1243 ^ and
1244 ^ having fasted days forty and nights, forty afterward he was hungry.
1252 ^ and
1253 ^ having come
1254 ^ the [one] tempting, he said to him,
1258 ^ if son you are
1261 ^ - of god,
1263 ^ speak,
1264 ^ that the stones these, loaves of bread might become.
1270 ^ - but
1272 ^ answering, he said,
1274 ^ it has been written:
1275 ^ not by bread alone shall live the man,
1282 ^ but by every word
1286 ^ coming out of [the] mouth of god.’
1290 ^ then takes him the devil to the holy city
1299 ^ and sets him upon the pinnacle of the temple,
1307 ^ and says to him,
1310 ^ if son you are
1313 ^ - of god,
1315 ^ throw yourself down;
1318 ^ it has been written for
1320 ^ -: to the angels of him he will give orders concerning you,
1327 ^ and in [their] hands will they bear up you,
1332 ^ lest ever you strike against a stone the foot of you.’
1339 ^ said to him - jesus, again
1344 ^ it has been written:
1345 ^ not you shall test [the] lord the god of you.’
1351 ^ again takes him the devil to a mountain high exceedingly,
1360 ^ and shows to him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them,
1372 ^ and he says to him,
1375 ^ these things to you
1377 ^ all will i give,
1379 ^ if
1380 ^ falling down, you will worship me.
1383 ^ then says to him - jesus,
1388 ^ get you away, satan;
1390 ^ it has been written for:
1392 ^ [the] lord the god of you, you shall worship,
1397 ^ and him alone shall you serve.’
1401 ^ then leaves him the devil,
1406 ^ and behold,
1408 ^ angels came
1410 ^ and were ministering to him.
1413 ^ having heard now
1415 ^ that john had been delivered up , he withdrew into - galilee.
1422 ^ and
1423 ^ having left - nazareth,
1426 ^ having come, he dwelt at capernaum, which [is] on the sea-side in [the] region of zebulun and naphtali,
1437 ^ that it might be fulfilled
1439 ^ that having been spoken by isaiah the prophet,
1445 ^ saying:
1446 ^ land of zebulun and land of naphtali, way of [the] sea, beyond the jordan, galilee of the gentiles —
1459 ^ the people
1461 ^ - sitting in darkness, a light have seen
1467 ^ great,
1468 ^ and to those sitting in [the] land and shadow of death,
1476 ^ a light has dawned on them.”
1479 ^ from that time began - jesus
1484 ^ to proclaim
1485 ^ and to say,
1487 ^ repent,
1488 ^ has drawn near for the kingdom of the heavens.
1494 ^ walking now beside the sea - of galilee, he saw two brothers, simon
1505 ^ - called peter, and andrew the brother of him,
1513 ^ casting a net into the sea;
1518 ^ they were for fishermen.
1521 ^ and he says to them,
1524 ^ come follow after me,
1527 ^ and i will make you fishers of men.
1532 ^ - and immediately
1535 ^ having left the nets, they followed him.
1540 ^ and
1541 ^ having gone on from there, he saw others, two brothers, james the [son] - of zebedee, and john the brother of him,
1556 ^ in the boat with zebedee the father of them, mending the nets of them;
1568 ^ and he called them.
1571 ^ - and immediately,
1574 ^ having left the boat and the father of them, they followed him.
1583 ^ and he was going throughout all - galilee,
1589 ^ teaching in the synagogues of them,
1594 ^ and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom,
1600 ^ and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
1610 ^ and went out the news of him into all - syria.
1619 ^ and they brought to him all
1623 ^ the sick
1625 ^ having
1626 ^ various diseases and pains oppressing,
1631 ^ and being possessed by demons,
1633 ^ and being epileptics, and paralytics;
1637 ^ and he healed them.
1640 ^ and followed him crowds great from - galilee, and [the] decapolis, and jerusalem, and judea, and beyond the jordan.
1658 ^ having seen then the crowds, he went up on the mountain;
1666 ^ and having sat down of him,
1669 ^ came to him the disciples of him.
1674 ^ and
1675 ^ opening the mouth of him, he was teaching them,
1681 ^ saying:
1682 ^ blessed [are] the poor in the spirit,
1687 ^ for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.
1694 ^ blessed [are]
1695 ^ those mourning,
1697 ^ for they will be comforted.
1700 ^ blessed the meek,
1703 ^ for they will inherit the earth.
1708 ^ blessed [are]
1709 ^ those hungering
1711 ^ and thirsting for - righteousness;
1715 ^ for they will be filled.
1718 ^ blessed [are] the merciful,
1721 ^ for they will receive mercy.
1724 ^ blessed the pure - in heart,
1729 ^ for they - god will see.
1734 ^ blessed the peacemakers,
1737 ^ for they sons of god will be called.
1742 ^ blessed [are]
1743 ^ those having been persecuted on account of righteousness,
1747 ^ for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.
1754 ^ blessed are you
1756 ^ when they shall insult you,
1759 ^ and shall persecute [you],
1761 ^ and shall say all kinds of evil against you,
1767 ^ lying on account of me.
1770 ^ rejoice
1771 ^ and exult,
1773 ^ for the reward of you [is] great in the heavens;
1781 ^ thus for they persecuted the prophets - before you.
1789 ^ you are the salt of the earth;
1795 ^ if, however, the salt becomes tasteless,
1800 ^ with what will it be salted.
1803 ^ for nothing it is potent any longer,
1807 ^ if not
1809 ^ having been cast out, to be trampled upon by - men.
1815 ^ you are the light of the world.
1821 ^ not is able a city
1824 ^ to be hidden
1825 ^ on a hill lying.
1828 ^ nor do they light a lamp
1831 ^ and put it under - a basket,
1837 ^ but upon the lampstand,
1841 ^ and it shines for all those in the house.
1848 ^ thus let shine the light of you before - men,
1856 ^ so that they may see your - good works,
1862 ^ and they should glorify the father of you - in the heavens.
1871 ^ not think
1873 ^ that i have come
1875 ^ to abolish the law or the prophets;
1881 ^ not i have come
1883 ^ to abolish,
1884 ^ but
1885 ^ to fulfill.
1886 ^ truly for i say to you,
1890 ^ until - shall pass away the heaven and the earth,
1898 ^ iota one, or one stroke of a letter, no not shall pass away from the law,
1909 ^ until - everything should happen.
1913 ^ whoever if then
1916 ^ shall break one of the commandments of these the least
1923 ^ and shall teach so the others, least he will be called in the kingdom of the heavens;
1935 ^ whoever now - shall keep
1939 ^ and shall teach [them],
1941 ^ this [one] great will be called in the kingdom of the heavens.
1949 ^ i say for to you,
1952 ^ that if not shall abound your - righteousness above [that] of the scribes and pharisees,
1964 ^ no not shall you enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
1972 ^ you have heard
1973 ^ that it was said to the ancients,
1977 ^ not you shall murder;
1979 ^ whoever now - shall murder, liable will be
1985 ^ to the judgment.’
1987 ^ i however say to you
1991 ^ that
1992 ^ everyone - being angry with the brother of him liable will be
2000 ^ to the judgment;
2002 ^ whoever now
2004 ^ - shall say to brother of him,
2009 ^ raca,’ liable will be
2012 ^ to the sanhedrin;
2014 ^ whoever now - shall say,
2018 ^ fool, liable will be
2021 ^ to the hell - of fire.
2026 ^ if therefore you shall offer the gift of you at the altar,
2035 ^ and there shall remember
2037 ^ that the brother of you has something against you,
2045 ^ leave there the gift of you before the altar,
2053 ^ and go away;
2055 ^ first be reconciled to brother of you;
2060 ^ and then
2062 ^ having come, offer the gift of you.
2067 ^ be
2068 ^ agreeing with accuser of you quickly,
2073 ^ while which you are with him, on the way,
2081 ^ lest ever you deliver the accuser to the judge,
2088 ^ and the judge to the officer,
2093 ^ and into prison you will be cast.
2097 ^ truly i say to you,
2100 ^ no not shall you come out from there,
2104 ^ until - you should pay the last kodranten!
2110 ^ you have heard
2111 ^ that it was said,
2113 ^ not shall you commit adultery.’
2115 ^ i however say to you
2119 ^ that
2120 ^ everyone - looking upon a woman
2124 ^ in order - to lust after her already has committed adultery with her in the heart of him.
2135 ^ if now the eye of you - right causes to stumble you,
2144 ^ pluck out it
2146 ^ and cast [it] from you;
2150 ^ it is better indeed for you
2153 ^ that should perish one of the members of you,
2159 ^ and not all the body of you should be cast into hell.
2168 ^ and if the right of you hand causes to stumble you,
2176 ^ cut off it
2178 ^ and cast [it] from you;
2182 ^ it is better indeed for you
2185 ^ that should perish one of the members of you,
2191 ^ and not all the body of you into hell should depart.
2200 ^ it was said also,
2202 ^ whoever - shall divorce the wife of him, let him give to her a letter of divorce.’
2211 ^ i however say to you
2215 ^ that
2216 ^ everyone - divorcing the wife of him, except on account of sexual immorality, causes her
2227 ^ to commit adultery.
2228 ^ and
2229 ^ whoever if
2231 ^ her having been divorced shall marry, commits adultery.
2234 ^ again, you have heard
2236 ^ that it was said to the ancients,
2240 ^ not shall you swear falsely;
2242 ^ you shall keep now to the lord the oaths of you.
2249 ^ i however say to you
2253 ^ not to swear at all:
2256 ^ neither by - heaven,
2260 ^ because [the] throne it is
2263 ^ - of god;
2265 ^ nor by the earth,
2269 ^ because [the] footstool it is
2272 ^ of the feet of him;
2275 ^ nor by jerusalem,
2278 ^ because [the] city it is
2281 ^ of the great king.
2284 ^ neither by the head of you shall you swear,
2290 ^ because not you are able
2293 ^ one hair white to make,
2297 ^ or black.
2299 ^ let it be however the statement of you, yes, ‘yes,
2306 ^ [and] ‘no, no.
2308 ^ the however
2310 ^ more than these, from - evil comes.
2316 ^ you have heard
2317 ^ that it was said,
2319 ^ eye for eye,
2322 ^ and tooth for tooth.’
2326 ^ i however say to you,
2330 ^ not to resist the evil [person].
2334 ^ instead, whoever you shall strike on the right cheek of you,
2343 ^ turn to him also the other;
2348 ^ and
2349 ^ to the one willing
2351 ^ you to sue
2353 ^ and the tunic of you to take,
2358 ^ yield to him also the cloak;
2363 ^ and whoever you shall compel to go mile one,
2369 ^ go with him two.
2373 ^ to the [one] asking of you, give;
2377 ^ and
2378 ^ the [one] desiring
2380 ^ from you to borrow, not you shall turn away from.
2385 ^ you have heard
2386 ^ that it was said,
2388 ^ you shall love - neighbor of you
2392 ^ and shall hate - enemy of you.’
2397 ^ i however say to you,
2401 ^ love the enemies of you,
2405 ^ and pray
2407 ^ for those persecuting you,
2411 ^ so that you may be sons of the father of you who is in [the] heavens.
2420 ^ for the sun of him he makes rise on evil and good,
2429 ^ and he sends rain on righteous and unrighteous.
2435 ^ if for you love
2438 ^ those loving you,
2441 ^ what reward have you?
2444 ^ do not also the tax collectors the same do?
2451 ^ and if you greet the brothers of you only,
2458 ^ what extraordinary do you? do not
2462 ^ also the gentiles the same do?
2468 ^ shall be therefore you perfect,
2472 ^ as the father of you who [is] heavenly, perfect is.
2480 ^ beware now
2482 ^ the righteousness of you not to do before - men
2490 ^ in order - to be seen by them;
2494 ^ if now otherwise,
2497 ^ reward not have you with the father of you who [is] in the heavens.
2508 ^ when therefore you do acts of charity,
2512 ^ not do sound a trumpet before you,
2516 ^ as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets,
2527 ^ so that they may have glory from - men.
2532 ^ truly i say to you,
2535 ^ they have the reward of them.
2539 ^ you however doing charity,
2543 ^ not let know the left [hand] of you
2548 ^ what is doing the right hand of you,
2553 ^ so that may be your - giving in - secret.
2561 ^ and the father of you,
2565 ^ the [one] seeing in - secret, will reward you.
2572 ^ and when you pray,
2575 ^ not you shall be like the hypocrites,
2580 ^ for they love
2582 ^ in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets standing to pray,
2593 ^ so that they might be seen - by men.
2597 ^ truly i say to you,
2600 ^ they have the reward of them.
2604 ^ you however,
2606 ^ when you pray, enter into the room
2612 ^ of you,
2613 ^ and
2614 ^ having shut the door of you, pray to father of you, the [one] in - secret.
2626 ^ and the father of you,
2630 ^ the [one] seeing in - secret, will reward you.
2637 ^ praying now not do use vain repetitions,
2641 ^ like the pagans,
2644 ^ they think for
2646 ^ that in the many words of them they will be heard.
2652 ^ not therefore be like to them,
2656 ^ knows for the father of you
2661 ^ of what things need you have,
2664 ^ before - your
2667 ^ asking him.
2669 ^ thus therefore pray you:
2673 ^ father of us, who [is] in the heavens, hallowed be the name of you.
2683 ^ come the kingdom of you;
2687 ^ be done the will of you, as in heaven, [so] also upon earth.
2697 ^ the bread of us - daily grant us today.
2705 ^ and forgive us the debts of us,
2711 ^ as also we forgive the debtors of us;
2718 ^ and not lead us into temptation,
2724 ^ but deliver us from - evil.’
2730 ^ if for you forgive - men the trespasses of them,
2738 ^ will forgive also you the father of you - heavenly.
2746 ^ if however not you forgive - men,
2752 ^ neither the father of you will forgive the trespasses of you.
2760 ^ whenever now you fast,
2763 ^ not be like the hypocrites, gloomy;
2769 ^ they disfigure for the appearance of them,
2774 ^ so that they might appear - to men
2778 ^ [as] fasting.
2779 ^ truly i say to you,
2782 ^ they have the reward of them.
2786 ^ you however,
2788 ^ fasting, anoint your - head
2793 ^ and the face of you wash,
2798 ^ so that not you might appear - to men
2803 ^ [as] fasting,
2804 ^ but - to father your the [one] in - secret;
2812 ^ and the father of you,
2816 ^ the [one] seeing in - secret, will reward you.
2823 ^ not store up for yourselves treasures upon the earth,
2830 ^ where moth and rust destroy,
2835 ^ and where thieves break in
2839 ^ and steal;
2841 ^ store up however for yourselves treasures in heaven,
2847 ^ where neither moth nor rust destroy,
2853 ^ and where thieves not do break in
2858 ^ nor steal.
2860 ^ where for is the treasure of you,
2866 ^ there will be also the heart of you.
2872 ^ the lamp of the body is the eye.
2879 ^ if therefore is the eye of you clear,
2886 ^ [the] whole - body of you full of light will be.
2892 ^ if however the eye of you evil is,
2899 ^ all the body of you full of darkness will be.
2905 ^ if then the light that [is] within you darkness is,
2914 ^ that darkness how great!
2917 ^ no one is able
2919 ^ two masters to serve;
2922 ^ either for the one he will hate,
2927 ^ and the other he will love;
2931 ^ or [the] one he will be devoted to,
2934 ^ and the other he will despise.
2938 ^ not you are able
2940 ^ god to serve,
2942 ^ and money.
2944 ^ because of this i say to you,
2948 ^ not be anxious about the life of you,
2953 ^ what you should eat
2955 ^ or what you should drink;
2958 ^ nor the body of you,
2962 ^ what you should put on.
2964 ^ not the life more is
2969 ^ than the food,
2971 ^ and the body than clothing?
2976 ^ look at the birds of the air,
2982 ^ that not they sow,
2985 ^ nor do they reap,
2987 ^ nor do they gather into barns —
2991 ^ and the father of you - heavenly feeds them.
2999 ^ not you much are more valuable than they?
3004 ^ who now
3006 ^ from you
3008 ^ being anxious is able
3010 ^ to add to the lifespan of him hour one?
3017 ^ and about clothing why are you anxious?
3022 ^ observe the lilies of the field,
3027 ^ how they grow:
3029 ^ [they do] not labor
3031 ^ nor do they spin.
3033 ^ i say however to you
3036 ^ that not even solomon in all the glory of him was adorned
3045 ^ like one of these.
3048 ^ if however the grass of the field,
3054 ^ today being [here],
3056 ^ and tomorrow into the furnace being thrown, - god thus clothes,
3065 ^ [will he] not much more you, o [you] of little faith?
3070 ^ not therefore be anxious,
3073 ^ saying,
3074 ^ what shall we eat?
3076 ^ or what shall we drink?
3079 ^ or what shall we wear?
3082 ^ all for
3084 ^ these things the gentiles seek after;
3088 ^ knows for the father of you - heavenly
3095 ^ that you have need of them all.
3099 ^ seek however first the kingdom of god and the righteousness of him,
3110 ^ and these things all will be added to you.
3115 ^ not therefore be anxious about things tomorrow,
3121 ^ - for
3123 ^ tomorrow will be anxious about itself.
3126 ^ sufficient to the day [is] the trouble of it.
3132 ^ not do judge,
3134 ^ that not you should be judged.
3137 ^ with whatever for
3140 ^ verdict you judge,
3142 ^ you will be judged;
3143 ^ and with whatever measure you measure,
3148 ^ it will be measured again to you.
3150 ^ why now do you look at the splinter that [is] in the eye the brother of you,
3162 ^ - and
3164 ^ the in - your [own] eye beam not notice?
3171 ^ or how shall you say to the brother of you,
3177 ^ permit that
3178 ^ i might cast out the splinter from the eye of you;
3185 ^ and behold,
3187 ^ the beam [is] in the eye of you?
3193 ^ hypocrite! cast out first from the eye of you the beam,
3202 ^ and then you will see clearly
3205 ^ to cast out the splinter from the eye of the brother of you.
3214 ^ not give that which [is] holy to the dogs,
3220 ^ nor cast the pearls of you before the pigs,
3228 ^ not lest they shall trample upon them with the feet of them,
3235 ^ and
3236 ^ having turned, they tear to pieces you.
3239 ^ ask
3240 ^ and it will be given to you;
3243 ^ seek
3244 ^ and you will find;
3246 ^ knock
3247 ^ and it will be opened to you.
3250 ^ everyone for
3252 ^ - asking receives;
3255 ^ and
3256 ^ the [one] seeking, finds;
3259 ^ and
3260 ^ to the [one] knocking, it will be opened.
3263 ^ or which is of you a man
3269 ^ whom will ask for the son of him bread,
3275 ^ not a stone will he give him?
3279 ^ or also a fish he will ask for,
3283 ^ not a serpent will he give him?
3287 ^ if therefore you,
3290 ^ evil being, know
3293 ^ gifts good to give to the children of you,
3299 ^ how much more the father of you who [is] in the heavens will give good things
3310 ^ to those asking him!
3313 ^ all things therefore,
3315 ^ as many as if you might desire
3318 ^ that should do to you the men,
3323 ^ so also you do to them.
3328 ^ this for is the law and the prophets.
3336 ^ enter through the narrow gate.
3341 ^ for wide [is] the gate
3345 ^ and broad the way
3349 ^ - leading to - destruction,
3354 ^ and many are
3357 ^ those entering through it.
3361 ^ for small [is] the gate
3365 ^ and
3366 ^ compressed the way
3369 ^ - leading to - life,
3374 ^ and few are
3377 ^ those finding it.
3380 ^ but beware of the false prophets,
3384 ^ who come to you in clothing of sheep;
3391 ^ inwardly however they are wolves ravenous.
3396 ^ by the fruits of them you will know them.
3402 ^ not do they gather from thorns grapes,
3407 ^ or from thistles figs?
3411 ^ so every tree good, fruits good produces;
3418 ^ - but
3420 ^ the bad tree, fruits bad produces.
3425 ^ not is able
3427 ^ a tree good, fruits bad to produce;
3432 ^ nor
3433 ^ a tree bad, fruits good to produce.
3438 ^ every tree
3440 ^ not producing fruit good is cut down
3445 ^ and into fire is thrown.
3449 ^ then surely by the fruits of them you will know them.
3456 ^ not everyone
3458 ^ - saying to me,
3461 ^ lord, lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens,
3469 ^ but
3470 ^ the [one] doing the will the father of me, who [is] in the heavens.
3481 ^ many will say to me in that the day,
3488 ^ lord, lord, not in your name did we prophesy,
3495 ^ and [in] your name demons cast out,
3501 ^ and [in] your name miracles many perform?
3508 ^ and then i will declare to them
3512 ^ -, never knew i you;
3516 ^ depart you from me,
3519 ^ those working - lawlessness.
3523 ^ everyone therefore,
3525 ^ whoever hears my - words these,
3531 ^ and does them, will be like a man wise,
3537 ^ who built his - house upon the rock.
3545 ^ and came down the rain,
3549 ^ and came the torrents,
3553 ^ and blew the winds,
3557 ^ and beat that house upon;
3562 ^ and not it fell,
3565 ^ it had been founded for upon the rock.
3570 ^ and everyone
3572 ^ - hearing my - words these,
3578 ^ and not doing them, he will be likened to a man foolish,
3585 ^ who built of him the house upon the sand.
3593 ^ and came down the rain,
3597 ^ and came the torrents,
3601 ^ and blew the winds,
3605 ^ and beat that house upon,
3610 ^ and it fell —
3612 ^ and was the fall of it great.
3618 ^ and it came to pass,
3620 ^ when had finished - jesus the words these,
3627 ^ were astonished the crowds at the teaching of him.
3634 ^ he was for
3636 ^ teaching them
3638 ^ as
3639 ^ authority having,
3641 ^ and not
3643 ^ as the scribes of them.
3647 ^ having come down now he from the mountain,
3653 ^ followed him crowds great.
3657 ^ and behold,
3659 ^ a leper
3660 ^ having come, was worshipping him,
3663 ^ saying,
3664 ^ lord, if you are willing,
3667 ^ you are able
3668 ^ me to cleanse.
3670 ^ and
3671 ^ having stretched out the hand, he touched him,
3676 ^ saying,
3677 ^ i am willing;
3678 ^ be you cleansed!
3679 ^ and immediately was cleansed his - leprosy.
3685 ^ and says to him - jesus,
3690 ^ see that
3691 ^ no one you tell.
3693 ^ but go,
3695 ^ yourself show to the priest,
3699 ^ and offer the gift
3703 ^ that commanded moses, for a testimony to them.
3709 ^ having entered now he into capernaum,
3714 ^ came to him a centurion,
3717 ^ imploring him,
3719 ^ and saying,
3721 ^ lord, the servant of me is lying in the house, paralyzed,
3730 ^ grievously tormented.
3732 ^ and he says to him,
3735 ^ i
3736 ^ having come, will heal him.
3739 ^ and
3740 ^ answering the centurion said,
3744 ^ lord, not i am worthy
3748 ^ that of me under the roof you should come;
3754 ^ but only speak the word,
3758 ^ and will be healed the servant of me.
3763 ^ also for i a man am
3768 ^ under authority,
3770 ^ having under me soldiers;
3774 ^ and i say to this [one],
3777 ^ go,
3778 ^ and he goes;
3780 ^ and to another,
3782 ^ come,
3783 ^ and he comes;
3785 ^ and to [the] servant of me,
3789 ^ do this,
3791 ^ and he does [it].
3793 ^ having heard now, - jesus marveled,
3798 ^ and said
3800 ^ to those following,
3802 ^ truly i say to you,
3805 ^ except no one so great faith in - israel have i found.
3813 ^ i say now to you
3816 ^ that many from east and west will come,
3823 ^ and will recline with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of the heavens;
3836 ^ the however
3838 ^ sons of the kingdom will be cast out, into the darkness the outer,
3847 ^ there will be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.
3856 ^ and said - jesus to the centurion,
3862 ^ go,
3863 ^ as you have believed,
3865 ^ be it to you.
3867 ^ and was healed the servant of him in the hour that.
3876 ^ and
3877 ^ having come - jesus to the house of peter, he saw the mother-in-law of him
3888 ^ lying sick
3889 ^ and fevering.
3891 ^ and he touched the hand of her,
3896 ^ and left her the fever;
3901 ^ and she arose
3903 ^ and was ministering to them.
3906 ^ evening now having come,
3909 ^ they brought to him
3911 ^ being possessed with demons many,
3913 ^ and he cast out the spirits by a word,
3918 ^ and all
3920 ^ those sick
3922 ^ being, he healed,
3924 ^ so that it might be fulfilled
3926 ^ that having been spoken by isaiah the prophet,
3932 ^ saying,
3933 ^ himself the infirmities of us he took,
3938 ^ and our diseases bore.”
3942 ^ having seen now - jesus a crowd around him, he commanded
3950 ^ to depart to the other side.
3954 ^ and
3955 ^ having come to [him], one scribe said to him,
3960 ^ teacher, i will follow you
3963 ^ wherever if you might go.
3966 ^ and says to him - jesus,
3971 ^ - foxes holes have,
3975 ^ and the birds of the air nests;
3981 ^ - but
3983 ^ the son - of man, no has
3988 ^ [place] where the head he might lay.
3992 ^ another now
3994 ^ of the disciples of him said to him,
3999 ^ lord, allow me first
4003 ^ to go
4004 ^ and to bury the father of me.
4009 ^ - but
4011 ^ jesus said to him,
4014 ^ follow me,
4016 ^ and leave the dead
4020 ^ to bury - their own dead.
4024 ^ and having entered he into the boat,
4030 ^ followed him the disciples of him.
4035 ^ and behold,
4037 ^ a storm great arose in the sea,
4043 ^ so that the boat was being swamped by the waves;
4050 ^ he himself however was sleeping.
4053 ^ and
4054 ^ having come to [him], they awoke him,
4057 ^ saying,
4058 ^ lord, save us,
4060 ^ we are perishing!
4061 ^ and he says to them,
4064 ^ why fearful are you, o [you] of little faith?
4068 ^ then,
4069 ^ having arisen, he rebuked the winds and the sea,
4076 ^ and there was a calm great.
4080 ^ - and
4082 ^ the men marveled,
4084 ^ saying,
4085 ^ what kind [of man] is this,
4088 ^ that even the winds and the sea him obey?
4097 ^ and having come he to the other side, to the region of the gadarenes,
4108 ^ met him two
4111 ^ being possessed by demons,
4112 ^ out of the tombs coming forth,
4116 ^ violent extremely,
4118 ^ so that not was able anyone
4122 ^ to pass by the way that.
4127 ^ and behold,
4129 ^ they cried out,
4130 ^ saying,
4131 ^ what to us and to you, son - of god?
4138 ^ are you come here before [the] time
4142 ^ to torment us?
4144 ^ there was now far off from them a herd of pigs many,
4152 ^ feeding.
4153 ^ - and
4155 ^ the demons were begging him,
4158 ^ saying,
4159 ^ if you cast out us,
4162 ^ send away us into the herd - of pigs.
4169 ^ and he said to them,
4172 ^ go.
4173 ^ - and
4175 ^ having gone out they went away into the pigs;
4180 ^ and behold,
4182 ^ rushed all the herd down the steep bank into the sea,
4192 ^ and perished in the waters.
4197 ^ those now feeding [them] fled,
4201 ^ and
4202 ^ having gone away into the city, they related everything, including the [matter]
4210 ^ of those being possessed by demons.
4212 ^ and behold,
4214 ^ all the city went out to meet - jesus.
4222 ^ and
4223 ^ having seen him, they begged [him]
4226 ^ that he would depart from the region of them.
4232 ^ and
4233 ^ having entered into a boat, he passed over
4237 ^ and came to the own city.
4243 ^ and behold,
4245 ^ they were bringing to him a paralytic
4248 ^ on a bed lying.
4251 ^ and
4252 ^ having seen - jesus the faith of them, he said to the paralytic,
4261 ^ take courage, son;
4263 ^ have been forgiven of you the sins.
4267 ^ and behold,
4269 ^ some of the scribes said to themselves,
4275 ^ this [man] blasphemes!
4277 ^ and
4278 ^ having known - jesus the thoughts of them, he said,
4285 ^ so that why think you evil in the hearts of you?
4292 ^ which for is easier,
4296 ^ to say,
4297 ^ are forgiven of you the sins,
4301 ^ or
4302 ^ to say.
4303 ^ arise
4304 ^ and walk?
4306 ^ so that however you may know
4309 ^ that authority has the son - of man on the earth
4319 ^ to forgive sins...
4321 ^ then he says to the paralytic,
4325 ^ having arisen, take up your - mat,
4330 ^ and go to the house of you.
4336 ^ and
4337 ^ having arisen, he went away to the house of him.
4343 ^ having seen now, the crowds marveled
4348 ^ and glorified - god,
4352 ^ the [one] having given authority such - to men.
4358 ^ and
4359 ^ passing on - jesus from there, he saw a man
4365 ^ sitting at the tax booth,
4369 ^ matthew named.
4371 ^ and he says to him,
4374 ^ follow me.
4376 ^ and
4377 ^ having arisen, he followed him.
4380 ^ and it came to pass
4382 ^ of him reclining in the house,
4387 ^ that behold,
4389 ^ many tax collectors and sinners,
4393 ^ having come, were reclining with - jesus and the disciples of him.
4401 ^ and
4402 ^ having seen [it], the pharisees said to disciples of him,
4409 ^ because of why with the tax collectors and sinners eats the teacher of you?
4420 ^ - and
4422 ^ having heard, he said,
4424 ^ not need have
4427 ^ those being strong
4429 ^ of a physician,
4430 ^ but
4431 ^ those sick
4433 ^ being.
4434 ^ having gone however, learn
4437 ^ what is,
4439 ^ mercy i desire,
4441 ^ and not sacrifice.’
4444 ^ not for i came
4447 ^ to call [the] righteous,
4449 ^ but
4450 ^ sinners.
4451 ^ then come to him the disciples of john,
4457 ^ saying,
4458 ^ because of why we and the pharisees do fast many times;
4466 ^ the however
4468 ^ disciples of you not fast?
4472 ^ and said to them - jesus,
4477 ^ not can the sons of the bridechamber
4483 ^ mourn
4484 ^ as long as with them is the bridegroom?
4491 ^ will come however days
4494 ^ when shall have been taken away from them the bridegroom,
4500 ^ and then they will fast.
4503 ^ no one however puts a patch of cloth unshrunk on clothing old;
4512 ^ tears away for the patch of it from the garment,
4520 ^ and a worse tear emerges.
4524 ^ nor pour they wine new into wineskins old;
4531 ^ if now lest
4534 ^ are burst the wineskins,
4537 ^ and the wine is poured out,
4541 ^ and the wineskins are destroyed.
4545 ^ but they pour wine new into wineskins new,
4552 ^ and both are preserved.
4555 ^ these things of him speaking to them,
4559 ^ behold,
4560 ^ a ruler certain
4562 ^ having come, was kneeling down to him,
4565 ^ saying
4566 ^ -, the daughter of me presently has died;
4572 ^ but
4573 ^ having come, lay the hand of you upon her,
4580 ^ and she will live.
4582 ^ and
4583 ^ having arisen, - jesus followed him,
4588 ^ also the disciples of him.
4592 ^ and behold,
4594 ^ a woman
4595 ^ having had a flux of blood twelve years,
4598 ^ having come up behind [him], touched the fringe of the garment of him.
4606 ^ she was saying for within herself,
4610 ^ if only i shall touch the garment of him,
4616 ^ i will be healed.
4617 ^ - and
4619 ^ jesus,
4620 ^ having turned
4621 ^ and having seen her, said,
4625 ^ take courage, daughter;
4627 ^ the faith of you has cured you.
4632 ^ and was cured the woman from the hour very.
4640 ^ and
4641 ^ having come - jesus
4644 ^ into the house of the ruler,
4649 ^ and having seen the flute players and the crowd
4656 ^ making a commotion, he says,
4658 ^ go away.
4659 ^ not for is dead the girl,
4664 ^ but sleeps.
4666 ^ and they began to laugh at him.
4669 ^ when now had been put outside the crowd,
4674 ^ having entered, he took hold of the hand of her,
4679 ^ and arose the girl.
4683 ^ and went out the report this into all the land that.
4693 ^ and passing on from there - jesus,
4698 ^ followed him two blind [men],
4702 ^ crying out
4703 ^ and saying,
4705 ^ have mercy on us, son of david.
4709 ^ having come now into the house, came to him the blind [men],
4718 ^ and says to them - jesus,
4723 ^ believe you
4724 ^ that i am able
4726 ^ this to do?
4728 ^ they say to him,
4730 ^ yes, lord.
4732 ^ then he touched the eyes of them,
4737 ^ saying,
4738 ^ according to the faith of you be it to you.
4744 ^ and were opened their - eyes.
4749 ^ and strictly instructed them - jesus,
4754 ^ saying,
4755 ^ see that
4756 ^ no one knows.
4758 ^ - but
4760 ^ having gone out, they make known him in all the land that.
4768 ^ [as] they now were going out,
4771 ^ behold,
4772 ^ they brought to him a man mute,
4776 ^ possessed by a demon.
4777 ^ and having been cast out the demon,
4781 ^ spoke the mute [man].
4784 ^ and marveled the crowds,
4788 ^ saying,
4789 ^ never was it seen thus in - israel.
4795 ^ the now
4797 ^ pharisees were saying,
4799 ^ by the prince of the demons he casts out - demons.
4807 ^ and was going throughout - jesus the cities all and the villages,
4817 ^ teaching in the synagogues of them,
4822 ^ and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom,
4828 ^ and healing every disease and every sickness.
4835 ^ having seen now the crowds, he was moved with compassion for them,
4842 ^ because they were
4844 ^ wearied
4845 ^ and cast away,
4847 ^ as sheep
4849 ^ not having a shepherd.
4852 ^ then he says to the disciples of him,
4857 ^ the indeed
4859 ^ harvest [is] plentiful,
4861 ^ the however
4863 ^ workmen [are] few;
4865 ^ beseech therefore the lord of the harvest,
4871 ^ that he might send out workmen into the harvest of him.
4878 ^ and
4879 ^ having summoned the twelve disciples of him, he gave to them authority over spirits unclean,
4889 ^ so as to cast out them
4892 ^ and to heal every disease and every sickness.
4899 ^ - and
4901 ^ of the twelve apostles the names are these:
4907 ^ first simon,
4909 ^ - called peter,
4912 ^ and andrew, the brother of him; and james the [son] of zebedee, and john the brother of him; philip, and bartholomew; thomas, and matthew the tax collector; james the [son] - of alphaeus, and thaddaeus; simon the zealot, and judas - iscariot,
4948 ^ the [one] also
4950 ^ having betrayed him.
4952 ^ these - twelve sent forth - jesus,
4958 ^ having instructed them,
4960 ^ saying,
4961 ^ into [the] way of the gentiles not go off,
4966 ^ and into any city of [the] samaritans not enter;
4972 ^ go however rather to those sheep
4978 ^ - being lost of [the] house of israel.
4982 ^ going on also proclaim,
4985 ^ saying
4986 ^ -, has drawn near the kingdom of the heavens.
4992 ^ [those] ailing heal,
4994 ^ dead raise,
4996 ^ lepers cleanse,
4998 ^ demons cast out;
5000 ^ freely you received,
5002 ^ freely give.
5004 ^ neither take along gold, nor silver, nor copper in the belts of you,
5015 ^ nor provision-bag for [the] way,
5019 ^ nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff;
5026 ^ worthy [is] for the workman
5030 ^ of the provisions of him.
5033 ^ into whatever now -
5037 ^ city or village you enter, inquire
5042 ^ who in it worthy is,
5047 ^ and there remain
5049 ^ until - you go forth.
5052 ^ entering now into the house, greet it.
5059 ^ and if indeed be the house worthy,
5066 ^ let come the peace of you upon it;
5072 ^ if however not it be worthy,
5077 ^ the peace of you to you let return.
5083 ^ and whoever - not will receive you,
5089 ^ nor will hear the words of you,
5094 ^ going forth out of the house or of the city that, shake off the dust of the feet of you!
5108 ^ truly i say to you,
5111 ^ more tolerable it will be
5113 ^ for [the] land of sodom and of gomorrah on day of judgment,
5120 ^ than the city for that.
5124 ^ behold,
5125 ^ i send forth you
5128 ^ as sheep in [the] midst of wolves;
5133 ^ be you therefore shrewd
5136 ^ as the serpents,
5139 ^ and innocent
5141 ^ as the doves.
5144 ^ beware however of - men;
5149 ^ they will deliver for you into courts,
5154 ^ and in the synagogues of them, they will flog you;
5161 ^ and before governors also,
5165 ^ and kings you will be brought, on account of me, for a testimony to them and to the gentiles.
5176 ^ when then they deliver up you,
5180 ^ not be anxious
5182 ^ how
5183 ^ or what you should speak;
5186 ^ it will be given for you in that - hour
5193 ^ what you should say.
5195 ^ not for you are
5199 ^ those speaking,
5201 ^ but the spirit of the father of you
5207 ^ - speaking through you.
5211 ^ will deliver up now brother, brother to death;
5217 ^ and father, child.
5220 ^ and will rise up children against parents,
5225 ^ and will put to death them.
5228 ^ and you will be
5230 ^ hated by all on account of the name of me;
5237 ^ the [one] however having endured to [the] end,
5242 ^ he will be saved.
5244 ^ whenever then they persecute you in the city one,
5252 ^ flee to the next.
5256 ^ truly for i say to you,
5260 ^ no not shall you have completed the cities of israel
5267 ^ until - be come the son of man.
5274 ^ not is a disciple above the teacher,
5280 ^ nor a servant above the master of him.
5286 ^ [it is] sufficient for the disciple
5289 ^ that he become as the teacher of him,
5295 ^ and the servant as the master of him.
5302 ^ if the master of the house beelzebul they called,
5307 ^ how much more those house members of him!
5312 ^ not therefore you should fear them;
5316 ^ nothing for is
5319 ^ concealed
5320 ^ which not will be revealed,
5323 ^ or hidden
5325 ^ which not will be known.
5328 ^ what i tell you in the darkness, speak in the light;
5338 ^ and
5339 ^ what in the ear you hear, proclaim upon the housetops!
5348 ^ and not you should be afraid
5351 ^ of those killing the body,
5356 ^ the however
5358 ^ soul not being able
5361 ^ to kill;
5362 ^ you should fear however rather
5365 ^ the [one] being able
5367 ^ both soul and body to destroy in hell.
5374 ^ not two sparrows for an assarion are sold?
5379 ^ and one of them not will fall to the ground, apart from the father of you?
5392 ^ of you now even
5395 ^ the hairs of the head all
5400 ^ numbered are.
5402 ^ not therefore you should fear;
5405 ^ than many sparrows are worth more you.
5409 ^ everyone therefore
5411 ^ who will confess in me before - men,
5418 ^ will confess also i in him before the father of me who [is] in the heavens.
5430 ^ whoever now - shall deny me before - men,
5438 ^ will deny i also him before the father of me who [is] in the heavens.
5449 ^ not think
5451 ^ that i came
5453 ^ to bring peace to the earth;
5458 ^ not i came
5460 ^ to bring peace,
5462 ^ but
5463 ^ a sword.
5464 ^ i came for
5466 ^ to set at variance a man against the father of him,
5472 ^ and a daughter against the mother of her,
5478 ^ and a daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law of her,
5484 ^ and enemies of the man the household of him.’
5491 ^ the [one] loving father or mother above me, not is of me worthy;
5502 ^ and
5503 ^ the [one] loving son or daughter above me, not is of me worthy.
5514 ^ and
5515 ^ he who not takes the cross of him
5521 ^ and follows after me, not is of me worthy.
5529 ^ the [one] having found the life of him will lose it;
5536 ^ and
5537 ^ the [one] having lost the life of him on account of me will find it.
5546 ^ the [one] receiving you, me receives;
5551 ^ and
5552 ^ the [one] me
5554 ^ receiving, receives
5556 ^ the [one] having sent me.
5559 ^ the [one] receiving a prophet in [the] name of a prophet, [the] reward of a prophet will receive;
5568 ^ and
5569 ^ the [one] receiving a righteous [man] in [the] name of a righteous [man], the reward of a righteous [man] will receive.
5578 ^ and whoever - shall give to drink one the little ones of these a cup of cold [water], only in [the] name of a disciple,
5592 ^ truly i say to you,
5595 ^ no not shall he lose the reward of him.
5601 ^ and it came to pass
5603 ^ when had finished - jesus
5607 ^ commanding the twelve disciples of him,
5612 ^ he departed from there
5614 ^ - to teach
5616 ^ and to preach in the cities of them.
5622 ^ - and
5624 ^ john,
5625 ^ having heard in the prison the works of the christ,
5633 ^ having sent two of the disciples of him, said to him,
5640 ^ you are
5642 ^ the coming [one],
5644 ^ or another are we to look for?
5647 ^ and
5648 ^ answering, - jesus said to them,
5653 ^ having gone, relate to john
5656 ^ what you hear
5658 ^ and see:
5660 ^ blind receive sight,
5662 ^ and lame walk,
5665 ^ lepers are cleansed,
5667 ^ and deaf hear,
5670 ^ and dead are raised,
5673 ^ and poor are gospelized.
5676 ^ and blessed is
5679 ^ he who if not shall fall away in me.
5685 ^ as these now were going away,
5688 ^ began - jesus
5691 ^ to speak to the crowds concerning john:
5696 ^ what went you out into the wilderness to see?
5702 ^ a reed
5703 ^ by [the] wind shaken?
5706 ^ but
5707 ^ what did you go out to see?
5710 ^ a man
5711 ^ in delicate [clothing] having been dressed?
5714 ^ behold,
5715 ^ those - delicate [clothing]
5718 ^ wearing, in the houses - of kings are.
5725 ^ but
5726 ^ what did you go out, to see?
5729 ^ a prophet
5730 ^ yes, i say to you,
5733 ^ and [one] more excellent than a prophet.
5736 ^ for this is [he]
5738 ^ concerning whom it has been written:
5741 ^ behold,
5742 ^ i send the messenger of me before [the] face of you,
5750 ^ who will prepare the way of you before you.’
5757 ^ truly i say to you,
5760 ^ not there has risen among [those] born of women one greater than john the baptist.
5769 ^ - yet
5771 ^ the least in the kingdom of the heavens, greater than he is.
5780 ^ from then
5782 ^ the days of john the baptist until now, the kingdom of the heavens is taken by violence,
5794 ^ and [the] violent claim it.
5798 ^ all for
5800 ^ the prophets and the law until john prophesied.
5808 ^ and if you are willing
5811 ^ to receive [it],
5812 ^ he is elijah,
5815 ^ the one being about
5817 ^ to come.
5818 ^ the [one] having ears, let him hear!
5822 ^ to what however will i compare the generation this?
5828 ^ like it is
5830 ^ little children
5831 ^ sitting in the markets,
5835 ^ and
5836 ^ calling out - to others, saying:
5840 ^ we piped for you,
5842 ^ and not you did dance;
5845 ^ we sang a dirge
5846 ^ and not you did wail.
5849 ^ came for john
5852 ^ neither eating
5854 ^ nor drinking,
5856 ^ and they say,
5858 ^ a demon he has!
5860 ^ came the son - of man
5865 ^ eating
5866 ^ and drinking,
5868 ^ and they say,
5870 ^ behold,
5871 ^ a man, a glutton and a drunkard, of tax collectors a friend
5877 ^ and of sinners!
5879 ^ but is justified - wisdom by the deeds of her.
5887 ^ then he began
5889 ^ to denounce the cities
5892 ^ in which had taken place the most miracles of him,
5899 ^ because not they repented.
5902 ^ woe to you, chorazin!
5905 ^ woe to you, bethsaida!
5908 ^ for if in tyre and sidon had taken place the miracles
5917 ^ - having come to pass in you,
5921 ^ long ago then in sackcloth and ashes they would have repented.
5928 ^ but i say to you,
5931 ^ for tyre and sidon more tolerable will it be in [the] day of judgment
5939 ^ than for you.
5941 ^ and you, capernaum, not to heaven will be exalted,
5948 ^ to hades will be brought down!
5951 ^ for if in sodom had taken place the miracles
5958 ^ - having taken place in you,
5962 ^ it would have remained - until the day.
5967 ^ but i say to you,
5970 ^ that for [the] land of sodom more tolerable will it be in day of judgment
5978 ^ than for you.
5980 ^ at that - time
5984 ^ answering, - jesus said,
5988 ^ i fully consent to you, father, lord of the heaven and the earth,
5997 ^ that you did hide these things from wise and learned,
6004 ^ and did reveal them to little children.
6008 ^ yes, - father,
6011 ^ for thus well-pleasing it was before you.
6017 ^ all things to me have been delivered by the father of me.
6024 ^ and no one knows the son,
6029 ^ if not the father;
6033 ^ nor the father anyone does know,
6038 ^ if not the son,
6042 ^ and
6043 ^ to whom if might choose the son
6048 ^ to reveal [him].
6049 ^ come to me, all
6053 ^ those toiling
6055 ^ and being burdened,
6057 ^ and i will give rest to you.
6060 ^ take the yoke of me upon you
6066 ^ and learn from me,
6070 ^ for gentle i am
6073 ^ and humble [in] the heart,
6077 ^ and you will find rest [for] the souls of you.
6083 ^ the for
6085 ^ yoke of me [is] easy,
6088 ^ and the burden of me light is.
6094 ^ at that - time went - jesus on the sabbaths through the grainfields,
6106 ^ - and
6108 ^ the disciples of him were hungry,
6111 ^ and they began
6113 ^ to pluck [the] heads of grain
6115 ^ and to eat.
6117 ^ - and
6119 ^ the pharisees,
6120 ^ having seen, said to him,
6123 ^ behold,
6124 ^ the disciples of you are doing
6128 ^ what not it is lawful to do on sabbath.
6134 ^ - and he said to them,
6138 ^ not you have read
6140 ^ what did david
6143 ^ when he was hungry,
6145 ^ and those with him —
6149 ^ how he entered into the house - of god,
6156 ^ and the loaves of the presentation they ate,
6162 ^ which not
6164 ^ lawful it was for him
6167 ^ to eat,
6168 ^ nor for those with him,
6172 ^ if not for the priests only?
6177 ^ or not have you read in the law,
6183 ^ that on the sabbath the priests in the temple the sabbath profane,
6194 ^ and guiltless are?
6197 ^ i say however to you
6200 ^ that the temple a greater than is here.
6206 ^ if however you had known
6209 ^ what is,
6211 ^ mercy i desire
6213 ^ and not sacrifice,’
6216 ^ not - you would have condemned the guiltless.
6221 ^ lord for is
6224 ^ of the sabbath the son of man.
6230 ^ and
6231 ^ having departed from there, he went into the synagogue of them.
6238 ^ and behold,
6240 ^ a man
6241 ^ a hand having
6243 ^ withered.
6244 ^ and they asked him,
6247 ^ saying,
6248 ^ is it lawful on the sabbaths
6252 ^ to heal?
6253 ^ so that they might accuse him.
6256 ^ - and he said to them,
6260 ^ what will there be among you
6264 ^ man,
6265 ^ who will have sheep one,
6269 ^ and if falls it on the sabbaths into a pit,
6277 ^ not will he take hold of it
6280 ^ and will raise [it] up?
6282 ^ how much therefore is more valuable a man than a sheep!
6287 ^ therefore it is lawful on the sabbaths
6291 ^ good to do.
6293 ^ then he says to [the] man,
6297 ^ stretch out your - hand.
6301 ^ and he stretched [it] out,
6303 ^ and it was restored, sound as the other.
6309 ^ having gone out now, the pharisees a counsel held against him,
6317 ^ how him they might destroy.
6320 ^ - and
6322 ^ jesus,
6323 ^ having known, withdrew from there.
6326 ^ and followed him multitudes great,
6331 ^ and he healed them all,
6335 ^ and he warned them
6338 ^ that not known him they should make —
6343 ^ so that might be fulfilled
6345 ^ that having been spoken by isaiah the prophet,
6351 ^ saying,
6352 ^ behold
6353 ^ the servant of me,
6356 ^ whom i have chosen,
6358 ^ the beloved of me,
6361 ^ in whom has found delight the soul of me.
6367 ^ i will put the spirit of me upon him,
6373 ^ and justice to the gentiles he will proclaim.
6378 ^ not will he quarrel
6380 ^ nor will he cry out,
6382 ^ nor will hear anyone in the streets the voice of him.
6391 ^ a reed
6392 ^ bruised not he will break,
6395 ^ and a wick
6397 ^ smoldering not he will quench,
6400 ^ until - he leads to victory - justice.
6407 ^ and in the name of him [the] gentiles will hope.”
6413 ^ then was brought to him
6416 ^ [one] possessed by a demon, blind and mute,
6420 ^ and he healed him,
6423 ^ in order for the mute [man] to speak
6427 ^ and to see.
6429 ^ and were amazed all the crowds,
6434 ^ and were saying,
6436 ^ whether this is the son of david?
6442 ^ - and
6444 ^ the pharisees,
6445 ^ having heard, said,
6447 ^ this [man] not casts out the demons,
6452 ^ if not by - beelzebul prince of the demons.
6460 ^ having known now the thoughts of them, he said to them,
6467 ^ every kingdom
6469 ^ having been divided against itself is brought to desolation,
6473 ^ and every city or house
6478 ^ having been divided against itself not will stand.
6483 ^ and if - satan, - satan casts out,
6490 ^ against himself he is divided.
6493 ^ how then will stand the kingdom of him?
6499 ^ and if i by beelzebul cast out - demons,
6507 ^ the sons of you by whom do they cast out?
6513 ^ on account of this, they judges will be
6518 ^ of you.
6519 ^ if however by [the] spirit of god i cast out - demons,
6528 ^ then has come upon you the kingdom - of god.
6536 ^ or how is able anyone
6540 ^ to enter into the house of the strong [man]
6546 ^ and the goods of him to plunder,
6551 ^ if not first he bind the strong [man]?
6557 ^ and then the house of him he will plunder.
6563 ^ the [one] not
6565 ^ being with me against me is,
6571 ^ and
6572 ^ the [one] not
6574 ^ gathering with me scatters.
6578 ^ because of this i say to you,
6582 ^ every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven - men;
6589 ^ - however
6591 ^ against [the] spirit blasphemy not will be forgiven.
6596 ^ and whoever if speaks a word against the son - of man,
6606 ^ it will be forgiven him;
6608 ^ whoever now - speaks against - spirit the holy,
6617 ^ not it will be forgiven him, neither in this - age
6625 ^ nor in the coming [one].
6629 ^ either make the tree good
6634 ^ and the fruit of it good,
6639 ^ or make the tree bad
6644 ^ and the fruit of it bad;
6649 ^ by for
6651 ^ the fruit, the tree is known.
6656 ^ offspring of vipers, how are you able
6660 ^ good things to speak,
6662 ^ evil being?
6664 ^ out of for
6666 ^ the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
6673 ^ the good man out of his good treasure puts forth good things;
6682 ^ and the evil man out of his evil treasure puts forth evil things.
6692 ^ i say now to you
6695 ^ that every word careless
6699 ^ that will speak - men,
6703 ^ they will give of it an account in day of judgment.
6710 ^ by for
6712 ^ the words of you, you will be justified,
6716 ^ and by the words of you, you will be condemned.
6722 ^ then answered him some of the scribes and pharisees,
6730 ^ saying,
6731 ^ teacher, we wish
6733 ^ from you a sign to see.
6737 ^ - and
6739 ^ answering he said to them,
6742 ^ a generation evil and adulterous a sign seeks for,
6748 ^ and a sign not will be given to it,
6753 ^ if not the sign of jonah the prophet.
6760 ^ just as for was jonah in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights,
6774 ^ so will be the son - of man in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
6790 ^ the men of nineveh will stand up in the judgment with the generation this,
6800 ^ and will condemn it;
6803 ^ for they repented at the preaching of jonah;
6809 ^ and behold,
6811 ^ greater than jonah here.
6814 ^ the queen of [the] south will rise up in the judgment with the generation this,
6824 ^ and will condemn it;
6827 ^ for she came from the ends of the earth
6834 ^ to hear the wisdom of solomon,
6838 ^ and behold,
6840 ^ greater than solomon here.
6843 ^ when now the unclean spirit is gone out from the man,
6852 ^ it passes through waterless places
6856 ^ seeking rest,
6858 ^ and none finds [it].
6861 ^ then it says,
6863 ^ to the house of me i will return,
6868 ^ from where i came out.
6870 ^ and
6871 ^ having come, it finds [it]
6873 ^ being unoccupied,
6874 ^ swept,
6875 ^ and put in order.
6877 ^ then it goes
6879 ^ and takes with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself,
6888 ^ and
6889 ^ having entered in they dwell there;
6892 ^ and becomes the last of the man that worse than the first.
6902 ^ so it will be also unto generation this the evil.
6910 ^ while he was speaking to the crowds,
6915 ^ behold,
6916 ^ the mother and the brothers of him were standing outside,
6924 ^ seeking
6925 ^ to him to speak.
6927 ^ said now someone to him,
6931 ^ behold,
6932 ^ the mother of you and the brothers of you outside are standing,
6941 ^ seeking
6942 ^ to you to speak.
6944 ^ - and
6946 ^ answering, he said
6948 ^ to the [one] telling him,
6951 ^ who is the mother of me,
6956 ^ and who are the brothers of me?
6962 ^ and
6963 ^ having stretched out the hand of him to the disciples of him, he said,
6972 ^ behold,
6973 ^ the mother of me and the brothers of me.
6980 ^ whoever for - shall do the will the father of me who [is] in [the] heavens,
6992 ^ he my brother and sister and mother is.
7000 ^ in the day that,
7004 ^ having gone forth - jesus [from] the house, was sitting by the sea.
7013 ^ and were gathered together to him crowds great,
7019 ^ so that he into a boat
7023 ^ having entered sat down,
7025 ^ and all the crowd on the shore stood.
7033 ^ and he spoke to them many things in parables,
7039 ^ saying,
7040 ^ behold,
7041 ^ went out
7042 ^ the [one] sowing
7044 ^ - to sow.
7046 ^ and
7047 ^ in - sowing of him, some indeed fell along the road,
7057 ^ and
7058 ^ having come, the birds devoured them.
7063 ^ other now fell upon the rocky places,
7069 ^ where not it had soil much,
7074 ^ and immediately it sprang up,
7077 ^ through - not
7080 ^ having depth of soil;
7083 ^ [the] sun now having risen, they were scorched,
7087 ^ and
7088 ^ through the not
7091 ^ having root, were dried up.
7094 ^ other now fell upon the thorns,
7100 ^ and grew up the thorns,
7104 ^ and choked them.
7107 ^ other now fell upon the soil - good,
7115 ^ and were yielding fruit,
7118 ^ some indeed a hundredfold,
7121 ^ some now sixty,
7124 ^ some now thirty.
7127 ^ the [one] having ears, let him hear!
7131 ^ and
7132 ^ having come to [him], the disciples said to him,
7137 ^ because of why in parables speak you to them?
7143 ^ - and
7145 ^ answering, he said to them,
7148 ^ because to you it has been granted
7151 ^ to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens;
7158 ^ to them however not it has been granted.
7162 ^ whoever for has,
7165 ^ will be given to him,
7167 ^ and he will be in abundance;
7169 ^ whoever now not has,
7173 ^ even
7174 ^ what he has will be taken away from him.
7179 ^ because of this, in parables to them i speak:
7185 ^ because
7186 ^ seeing, not do they see;
7189 ^ and
7190 ^ hearing, not do they hear,
7193 ^ nor do they understand.
7195 ^ and is fulfilled in them the prophecy of isaiah,
7201 ^ - saying:
7203 ^ in hearing you will hear,
7205 ^ and no not understand;
7209 ^ and
7210 ^ seeing you will see
7212 ^ and no not perceive.
7216 ^ has grown dull for the heart of the people this,
7223 ^ and with the ears barely they have heard,
7228 ^ and the eyes of them they have closed;
7233 ^ not lest they should see with the eyes,
7237 ^ and with the ears they should hear,
7241 ^ and with the heart they should understand,
7245 ^ and should return,
7247 ^ and i will heal them.’
7250 ^ of you however blessed
7253 ^ [are] the eyes,
7255 ^ because they see;
7257 ^ and the ears of you,
7261 ^ because they hear.
7263 ^ truly for i say to you,
7267 ^ that many prophets and righteous [men] longed
7273 ^ to see
7274 ^ what you see,
7276 ^ and not saw;
7279 ^ and
7280 ^ to hear
7281 ^ what you hear,
7283 ^ and not heard.
7286 ^ you therefore hear the parable
7291 ^ of the [one] having sown:
7293 ^ everyone hearing the word of the kingdom
7299 ^ and not understanding,
7302 ^ comes the evil one
7305 ^ and snatches away
7307 ^ that having been sown in the heart of him.
7313 ^ this is
7315 ^ the [one] on the path
7319 ^ having been sown.
7320 ^ that which now upon the rocky places
7325 ^ having been sown,
7326 ^ this is
7328 ^ the [one] the word
7331 ^ hearing,
7332 ^ and immediately with joy receiving it;
7338 ^ no he has now root in himself,
7344 ^ but temporary is;
7347 ^ having come however tribulation or persecution on account of the word,
7355 ^ immediately he falls away.
7357 ^ that which now among the thorns
7362 ^ having been sown,
7363 ^ this is
7365 ^ the [one] the word
7368 ^ hearing,
7369 ^ and the care - [the] present age and the deceit - of riches choke the word,
7382 ^ and unfruitful it becomes.
7385 ^ that however on the good soil
7391 ^ having been sown,
7392 ^ this is
7394 ^ the [one] the word
7397 ^ hearing
7398 ^ and understanding,
7400 ^ who indeed brings forth fruit
7403 ^ and produces —
7405 ^ some indeed a hundredfold,
7408 ^ some now sixty,
7411 ^ some now thirty.
7414 ^ another parable put he before them,
7418 ^ saying,
7419 ^ has become like the kingdom of the heavens, a man
7425 ^ having sown good seed in the field of him.
7432 ^ in now
7434 ^ the [time] are sleeping the men, came his - enemy
7442 ^ and sowed weeds in [the] midst of the wheat,
7449 ^ and went away.
7451 ^ when now sprouted the plants
7456 ^ and fruit produced,
7459 ^ then appeared also the weeds.
7464 ^ having come to [him] now, the servants the master of the house said to him,
7472 ^ sir, not good seed did you sow in - your field?
7481 ^ how then has it the weeds?
7485 ^ - and he said to them,
7489 ^ an enemy, a man this did.
7493 ^ - and
7495 ^ the servants said, to him
7498 ^ do you desire then
7500 ^ [that] having gone forth, we should gather them?
7503 ^ - and he said,
7506 ^ no;
7507 ^ not lest
7508 ^ gathering the weeds, you would uproot with them the wheat.
7516 ^ allow
7517 ^ to grow together both until the harvest;
7522 ^ and in the time of the harvest i will say to the harvesters,
7530 ^ gather first the weeds,
7534 ^ and bind them into bundles
7539 ^ in order - to burn them;
7543 ^ - and
7545 ^ the wheat, gather together into the barn of me.”’
7551 ^ another parable put he before them,
7555 ^ saying,
7556 ^ like is the kingdom of the heavens
7562 ^ to a grain of mustard,
7564 ^ which having taken, a man sowed in the field of him;
7572 ^ which smallest indeed is
7576 ^ of all the seeds;
7579 ^ when however it is grown,
7582 ^ greater than the garden plants it is,
7586 ^ and becomes a tree,
7589 ^ so that come the birds of the air
7595 ^ and perch in the branches of it.
7601 ^ another parable spoke he to them:
7605 ^ like is the kingdom of the heavens
7611 ^ to leaven,
7612 ^ which having taken, a woman hid in of flour measures three,
7620 ^ until of it was leavened all.
7624 ^ these things all spoke - jesus in parables to the crowds,
7633 ^ and without a parable not he was speaking to them,
7639 ^ so that might be fulfilled
7641 ^ that having been spoken by the prophet,
7646 ^ saying,
7647 ^ i will open in parables the mouth of me;
7653 ^ i will utter
7654 ^ things hidden from [the] foundation [of the] world.”
7658 ^ then
7659 ^ having dismissed the crowds, he went into the house.
7666 ^ and came to him the disciples of him,
7672 ^ saying,
7673 ^ explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.
7681 ^ - and
7683 ^ answering he said,
7685 ^ the [one] sowing the good seed is the son - of man;
7695 ^ - and
7697 ^ the field is the world;
7701 ^ - and
7703 ^ the good seed,
7705 ^ these are the sons of the kingdom;
7711 ^ - and
7713 ^ the weeds are the sons of the evil [one];
7719 ^ - and
7721 ^ the enemy
7722 ^ - having sown them is the devil;
7728 ^ - and
7730 ^ the harvest [the] consummation of the age is,
7734 ^ - and
7736 ^ the harvesters angels are.
7739 ^ as therefore is gathered the weeds,
7744 ^ and in fire is consumed,
7747 ^ thus it will be in the consummation of the age.
7754 ^ will send forth the son - of man the angels of him,
7762 ^ and they will gather out of the kingdom of him all the causes of sin
7771 ^ and those practicing - lawlessness,
7776 ^ and they will cast them into the furnace of the fire;
7784 ^ there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
7793 ^ then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of the father of them.
7806 ^ the [one] having ears, let him hear!
7810 ^ like is the kingdom of the heavens
7816 ^ treasure
7817 ^ having been hidden in the field,
7821 ^ which, having found, a man hid,
7825 ^ and for the joy of it goes
7831 ^ and he sells all
7834 ^ that he has
7836 ^ and buys the field that.
7841 ^ again like is the kingdom of the heavens
7848 ^ a man, a merchant
7850 ^ seeking fine pearls;
7853 ^ having found now one very precious pearl,
7858 ^ having gone away, he has sold all things
7861 ^ as many as he had,
7863 ^ and bought it.
7866 ^ again like is the kingdom of the heavens
7873 ^ a dragnet
7874 ^ having been cast into the sea,
7878 ^ and of every kind having gathered together,
7883 ^ which,
7884 ^ when it was filled, having drawn up on the shore
7890 ^ and having sat down, they collected the good into vessels,
7897 ^ the and
7899 ^ bad out they cast.
7902 ^ thus will it be in the consummation of the age;
7909 ^ will go out the angels,
7912 ^ and will separate the evil from [the] midst of the righteous,
7920 ^ and will cast them into the furnace of the fire.
7928 ^ there will be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.
7937 ^ have you understood these things all?
7940 ^ they say to him,
7942 ^ yes.
7943 ^ - and he said to them,
7947 ^ because of this, every scribe
7951 ^ having been discipled into the kingdom of the heavens like is
7958 ^ a man, a master of a house,
7960 ^ who puts forth out of the treasure of him [things] new and old.
7969 ^ and it came to pass,
7971 ^ when had finished - jesus the parables these,
7978 ^ he withdrew from there.
7980 ^ and
7981 ^ having come into the region his [own], he was teaching them in the synagogue of them,
7992 ^ so that are astonished they
7995 ^ and are saying,
7997 ^ from where to this [man] the wisdom this and the miraculous powers?
8005 ^ not this is the of the carpenter son?
8012 ^ [is] not the mother of him called mary?
8018 ^ and the brothers of him james and joseph and simon and judas?
8029 ^ and the sisters of him
8033 ^ not all with us are?
8038 ^ from where then to this [man] these things all?
8043 ^ and they were offended at him.
8047 ^ - but
8049 ^ jesus said to them,
8052 ^ not is a prophet without honor,
8056 ^ if not in the hometown, and in the household of him.
8066 ^ and not he did there miracles many, because of the unbelief of them.
8076 ^ at that - time heard herod the tetrarch the news of jesus,
8087 ^ and he said to [the] servants of him,
8092 ^ this is john the baptist;
8097 ^ he is risen from the dead,
8102 ^ and because of this, the miraculous powers are working in him.
8110 ^ - for
8112 ^ herod
8113 ^ having seized - john, he bound him
8118 ^ and in prison put [him], on account of herodias, the wife of philip, the brother of him.
8130 ^ had been saying for - john to him,
8135 ^ not it is lawful for you
8138 ^ to have her.
8140 ^ although
8141 ^ wishing
8142 ^ him to kill, he feared the multitude,
8147 ^ because as a prophet him they were holding.
8152 ^ [the] birthday now having been celebrated
8155 ^ - of herod,
8157 ^ danced the daughter - of herodias in the midst,
8165 ^ and pleased - herod,
8169 ^ whereupon with oath he promised
8173 ^ to her to give
8175 ^ whatever if she should ask.
8178 ^ - and
8180 ^ having been urged on by the mother of her,
8185 ^ give me, she says,
8188 ^ here upon a platter the head of john the baptist.
8196 ^ and
8197 ^ having been grieved the king, on account of the oaths
8203 ^ and those reclining with [him], he commanded [it]
8207 ^ to be given.
8208 ^ and
8209 ^ he having sent, beheaded - john in the prison.
8216 ^ and was brought the head of him on a platter,
8223 ^ and was given to the girl,
8227 ^ and she brought [it] to [the] mother of her.
8232 ^ and
8233 ^ having come, the disciples of him took the body,
8240 ^ and buried it;
8243 ^ and
8244 ^ having come, they told - jesus.
8248 ^ having heard now, - jesus withdrew from there by boat to a secluded place apart himself.
8261 ^ and
8262 ^ having heard [of it], the crowds followed him on foot from the towns.
8271 ^ and
8272 ^ having gone out, he saw great a crowd,
8276 ^ and was moved with compassion toward them,
8280 ^ and healed the sick of them.
8285 ^ evening now having come,
8288 ^ came to him the disciples,
8292 ^ saying,
8293 ^ desolate is this place,
8297 ^ and the time already is gone by.
8302 ^ dismiss the crowds,
8305 ^ that
8306 ^ having gone into the villages, they might buy for themselves food.
8313 ^ - and
8315 ^ jesus said to them,
8318 ^ no need they have
8321 ^ to go away.
8322 ^ give to them you
8325 ^ to eat.
8326 ^ - and they say to him,
8330 ^ not we have here,
8333 ^ if not five loaves and two fish.
8340 ^ - and he said,
8343 ^ bring to me here them.
8347 ^ and
8348 ^ having commanded the crowds
8351 ^ to sit down on the grass,
8355 ^ having taken the five loaves and the two fish,
8363 ^ having looked up to - heaven, he spoke a blessing;
8368 ^ and
8369 ^ having broken, he gave to the disciples the loaves,
8375 ^ - and
8377 ^ the disciples to the crowds.
8380 ^ and ate all
8383 ^ and were satisfied;
8385 ^ and they took up
8387 ^ that being over and above of the fragments, twelve hand-baskets full.
8394 ^ those then
8396 ^ eating were men about five thousand, besides women and children.
8405 ^ and immediately he compelled
8408 ^ the disciples to enter into the boat
8414 ^ and to go before him to the other side,
8420 ^ until that he would have dismissed the crowds.
8425 ^ and
8426 ^ having dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself
8435 ^ to pray.
8436 ^ evening now having arrived,
8439 ^ alone he was there.
8442 ^ - and
8444 ^ the boat, now stadia many from the land, being
8452 ^ tossed by the waves
8456 ^ was, for contrary [was] the wind.
8461 ^ in [the] fourth now
8463 ^ watch of the night, he went to them,
8469 ^ walking on the sea.
8473 ^ - and
8475 ^ the disciples,
8476 ^ having seen him
8478 ^ on the sea walking, were troubled,
8483 ^ saying
8484 ^ -, a ghost it is!
8487 ^ and in - fear they cried out.
8492 ^ immediately now spoke - jesus to them,
8498 ^ saying,
8499 ^ take courage!
8500 ^ i it is,
8502 ^ not fear.
8504 ^ answering now to him, - peter said,
8510 ^ lord, if you [it] is,
8514 ^ command me
8516 ^ to come to you upon the waters.
8522 ^ - and he said,
8525 ^ come.
8526 ^ and
8527 ^ having descended from the boat, - peter walked upon the water
8537 ^ and came to - jesus.
8542 ^ seeing now the wind charging, he was afraid,
8548 ^ and
8549 ^ having begun
8550 ^ to sink, he cried out,
8552 ^ saying,
8553 ^ lord, save me!
8556 ^ immediately now - jesus,
8560 ^ having stretched out the hand, took hold of him
8565 ^ and says to him,
8568 ^ [you] of little faith, of why did you doubt?
8572 ^ and having entered they into the boat,
8578 ^ ceased the wind.
8581 ^ those then
8583 ^ in the boat worshiped him,
8588 ^ saying,
8589 ^ truly, of god son you are!
8593 ^ and
8594 ^ having crossed over, they came to the land of gennesaret.
8601 ^ and
8602 ^ having recognized him, the men the place of that sent to all the surrounding region that
8615 ^ and brought to him all
8619 ^ those sick
8621 ^ being,
8622 ^ and they were begging him
8625 ^ that only they might touch the fringe of the garment of him;
8633 ^ and
8634 ^ as many as touched were cured.
8637 ^ then come - to jesus from jerusalem pharisees and scribes,
8646 ^ saying,
8647 ^ because of why the disciples of you break the tradition of the elders?
8657 ^ not for they wash the hands of them
8663 ^ when bread they shall eat.
8666 ^ - and
8668 ^ answering he said to them,
8671 ^ because of why also you break the commandment - of god on account of the tradition of you?
8684 ^ - for
8686 ^ god commanded,
8688 ^ honor the father and the mother’
8694 ^ and,
8695 ^ the [one] speaking evil of father or mother, in death must end.’
8702 ^ you however say,
8705 ^ whoever - shall say to the father or the mother,
8713 ^ [it is] a gift,
8714 ^ whatever if by me you might be profited,
8719 ^ no not he shall honor the father of himself.
8725 ^ and you made void the commandment - of god on account of the tradition of you!
8735 ^ hypocrites! rightly prophesied concerning you isaiah,
8741 ^ saying,
8742 ^ the people this, with the lips me it honors;
8749 ^ the however
8751 ^ heart of them, far away is kept from me;
8757 ^ in vain then they worship me,
8761 ^ teaching [as] doctrines [the] precepts of men.’
8765 ^ and
8766 ^ having called to [him] the crowd, he said to them,
8771 ^ hear
8772 ^ and understand!
8774 ^ not
8775 ^ what is entering into the mouth defiles the man;
8783 ^ but
8784 ^ that going forth out of the mouth,
8789 ^ this defiles the man.
8793 ^ then
8794 ^ having come near, the disciples said to him,
8799 ^ know you
8800 ^ that the pharisees,
8803 ^ having heard the saying, were offended?
8807 ^ - and
8809 ^ answering he said,
8811 ^ every plant
8813 ^ that not has planted the father of me - heavenly, it will be rooted up.
8822 ^ leave them!
8824 ^ blind they are
8826 ^ guides of the blind.
8828 ^ blind now blind if they lead,
8833 ^ both into a pit will fall.
8837 ^ answering then, - peter said to him,
8843 ^ explain to us the parable this.
8848 ^ - and he said,
8851 ^ still also you without understanding are?
8856 ^ not yet understand you
8858 ^ that everything
8860 ^ - entering into the mouth, into the stomach goes,
8869 ^ and into [the] sewer is cast out?
8873 ^ the things however going forth out of the mouth, out of the heart come forth,
8883 ^ and these defile the man.
8887 ^ out of for
8889 ^ the heart come forth thoughts evil, murders, adulteries, sexual immorality, thefts, false testimonies, slanders.
8900 ^ these are
8902 ^ the things defiling the man;
8906 ^ - but with unwashed hands
8910 ^ to eat, not defiles the man.
8915 ^ and
8916 ^ having gone forth from there, - jesus withdrew to the district of tyre and sidon.
8927 ^ and behold,
8929 ^ a woman canaanite from the region same,
8935 ^ having approached, was crying out,
8937 ^ saying,
8938 ^ have mercy on me, lord, son of david;
8943 ^ the daughter of me miserably is possessed by a demon.
8948 ^ - and not he answered her a word.
8954 ^ and
8955 ^ having come to [him], the disciples of him were imploring him,
8961 ^ saying,
8962 ^ dismiss her,
8964 ^ for she cries out after us!
8968 ^ - and
8970 ^ answering he said,
8972 ^ not i was sent,
8974 ^ if not to the sheep
8979 ^ - being lost of [the] house of israel.
8983 ^ - and
8985 ^ having come, she was worshiping him,
8988 ^ saying,
8989 ^ lord, help me!
8992 ^ - and
8994 ^ answering, he said,
8996 ^ not it is right
8999 ^ to take the bread of the children,
9004 ^ and to cast [it] to the dogs.
9008 ^ - and she said,
9011 ^ yes, lord;
9013 ^ even however the dogs eat of the crumbs
9021 ^ - falling from the table of the masters of them.
9029 ^ then
9030 ^ answering, - jesus said to her,
9035 ^ o woman, great [is] of you the faith!
9041 ^ be it to you
9043 ^ as you desire.
9045 ^ and was healed the daughter of her from the hour that.
9054 ^ and
9055 ^ having departed from there, - jesus went along the sea - of galilee;
9065 ^ and
9066 ^ having gone up on the mountain, he was sitting there.
9072 ^ and came to him crowds great,
9077 ^ having with them lame, blind, crippled, mute, and others many,
9087 ^ and they placed them at the feet of him,
9094 ^ and he healed them;
9097 ^ so that the crowd marveled,
9101 ^ seeing mute
9103 ^ speaking, crippled restored, and lame
9108 ^ walking, and blind
9111 ^ seeing;
9112 ^ and they glorified the god of israel.
9117 ^ - and
9119 ^ jesus,
9120 ^ having called to [him] the disciples of him, said,
9125 ^ i am moved with compassion toward the crowd,
9129 ^ because already days three they continue with me,
9135 ^ and nothing have
9138 ^ that they might eat;
9140 ^ and
9141 ^ to send away them hungry, not i am willing,
9146 ^ not lest they faint on the way.
9151 ^ and say to him the disciples,
9156 ^ from where to us in a secluded place, loaves so many
9162 ^ as to satisfy a crowd so great.
9166 ^ and says to them - jesus,
9171 ^ how many loaves have you?
9174 ^ - and they said,
9177 ^ seven, and a few small fish.
9181 ^ and
9182 ^ he having commanded the crowds
9185 ^ to sit down on the ground, having taken the seven loaves and the fish,
9196 ^ and
9197 ^ having given thanks, he broke [them]
9199 ^ and was giving to disciples,
9203 ^ - and the
9205 ^ disciples to the crowd.
9208 ^ and ate all
9211 ^ and were satisfied;
9213 ^ and
9214 ^ that being over and above of the fragments, they took up
9219 ^ seven baskets full.
9222 ^ those then
9224 ^ eating were four thousand men, besides women and children.
9232 ^ and
9233 ^ having dismissed the crowds, he entered into the boat
9240 ^ and came to the region of magadan.
9246 ^ and
9247 ^ having approached, the pharisees and sadducees,
9252 ^ testing , asked him
9255 ^ a sign out of - heaven to show them.
9261 ^ - and
9263 ^ answering he said to them,
9266 ^ evening having come,
9268 ^ you say,
9269 ^ fair weather;
9270 ^ is red for the sky.
9274 ^ and in the morning,
9276 ^ today a storm;
9278 ^ is red for
9280 ^ being overcast the sky.
9283 ^ the indeed
9285 ^ appearance of the sky you know [how]
9289 ^ to discern,
9290 ^ - but the signs of the times, not you are able!
9297 ^ a generation evil and adulterous, a sign seeks,
9303 ^ and a sign not will be given to it,
9308 ^ if not the sign of jonah.
9313 ^ and
9314 ^ having left them, he went away.
9317 ^ and
9318 ^ having come the disciples to the other side, they forgot
9325 ^ bread to take.
9327 ^ - and
9329 ^ jesus said to them,
9332 ^ watch
9333 ^ and beware of the leaven of the pharisees and sadducees.
9342 ^ - and they were reasoning among themselves,
9347 ^ saying,
9348 ^ because bread not we took.
9352 ^ having known [this] however, - jesus said,
9357 ^ why reason you among yourselves, o [you] of little faith,
9362 ^ because bread not you took?
9366 ^ not yet do you understand,
9368 ^ nor remember the five loaves for the five thousand,
9375 ^ and how many hand-baskets you gathered?
9379 ^ nor the seven loaves for the four thousand,
9385 ^ and how many baskets you gathered?
9389 ^ how not understand you
9392 ^ that, not concerning bread i spoke to you,
9398 ^ to beware also of the leaven of the pharisees and sadducees?
9407 ^ then they understood
9409 ^ that not he said
9412 ^ to beware of the leaven of bread,
9418 ^ but
9419 ^ of the teaching of the pharisees and sadducees.
9426 ^ having come then - jesus into the district of caesarea - philippi, he was questioning the disciples of him,
9440 ^ saying,
9441 ^ whom do pronounce - men to be the son of man?
9450 ^ - and they said,
9453 ^ some indeed
9455 ^ john the baptist;
9458 ^ others now
9460 ^ elijah;
9461 ^ others now
9463 ^ jeremiah, or one of the prophets.
9468 ^ he says to them,
9470 ^ you but
9472 ^ whom me do you pronounce to be?
9476 ^ answering now, simon peter said,
9481 ^ you are the christ, the son of god
9489 ^ the living.
9491 ^ answering now, - jesus said to him,
9497 ^ blessed are you, simon barjona!
9501 ^ for flesh and blood not revealed [it] to you,
9508 ^ but the father of me, who [is] in the heavens.
9516 ^ i also now to you say
9520 ^ that you are peter,
9524 ^ and on this the rock i will build my - church,
9533 ^ and [the] gates of hades not will prevail against it.
9539 ^ i will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens;
9547 ^ and
9548 ^ whatever if you might bind on the earth, will be
9555 ^ bound in the heavens;
9559 ^ and
9560 ^ whatever if you might loose on the earth, will be
9567 ^ loosed in the heavens.
9571 ^ then instructed he the disciples
9575 ^ that to no one they should say
9578 ^ that he is the christ.
9583 ^ from that time began - jesus
9588 ^ to show to the disciples of him
9592 ^ that it is necessary for
9594 ^ him to jerusalem to go away,
9598 ^ and many things to suffer from the elders and chief priests and scribes,
9608 ^ and to be killed,
9610 ^ and on the third day to be raised.
9615 ^ and
9616 ^ having taken aside him, - peter began
9621 ^ to rebuke him,
9623 ^ saying,
9624 ^ far be it from you, lord;
9627 ^ never, not will be to you this.
9632 ^ - and
9634 ^ having turned he said - to peter,
9638 ^ get behind me, satan!
9642 ^ a stumbling block you are
9644 ^ to me.
9645 ^ for not your thoughts are of the things - of god,
9651 ^ but the things of men.
9655 ^ then - jesus said to disciples of him,
9662 ^ if anyone desires
9665 ^ after me to come,
9668 ^ let him deny himself,
9670 ^ and take up the cross of him,
9675 ^ and follow me.
9678 ^ whoever for if might desire
9682 ^ the life of him to save, will lose it;
9688 ^ whoever however - might lose the life of him on account of me, will find it.
9699 ^ what for will it profit a man,
9703 ^ if the world whole he gains,
9708 ^ - but
9710 ^ the soul of him loses?
9713 ^ or what will give a man [as] an exchange for the soul of him?
9721 ^ is about for the son of the man
9727 ^ to come in the glory the father of him, with the angels of him;
9738 ^ and then he will give to each according to the deeds of him.
9746 ^ truly i say to you
9749 ^ -, there are some
9752 ^ of those here
9754 ^ standing
9755 ^ who no not shall taste of death
9760 ^ until - they have seen the son - of man
9767 ^ coming in the kingdom of him.
9772 ^ and after days six, takes with [him] - jesus, - peter and james and john, the brother of him,
9788 ^ and brings up them into a mountain high by themselves.
9796 ^ and he was transfigured before them,
9800 ^ and shone the face of him like the sun,
9808 ^ - and
9810 ^ the clothes of him became white as the light.
9817 ^ and behold,
9819 ^ appeared to them moses and elijah,
9824 ^ talking with him.
9827 ^ answering now, - peter said - to jesus,
9834 ^ lord, good it is
9837 ^ for us here to be.
9840 ^ if you wish,
9842 ^ i will make here three tabernacles,
9846 ^ for you one, and for moses one, and for elijah one.
9854 ^ while yet he was speaking,
9857 ^ behold,
9858 ^ a cloud bright overshadowed them;
9862 ^ and behold,
9864 ^ a voice out of the cloud,
9868 ^ saying,
9869 ^ this is the son of me, the beloved,
9876 ^ in whom i am well pleased.
9879 ^ listen to him!
9881 ^ and
9882 ^ having heard [it], the disciples fell upon face of them
9889 ^ and were terrified greatly.
9892 ^ and having come to [them] - jesus,
9896 ^ and having touched them,
9899 ^ he said,
9900 ^ rise up,
9901 ^ and not be afraid.
9904 ^ having lifted up and the eyes of them, no one they saw
9911 ^ if not himself jesus alone.
9916 ^ and [as] were descending they from the mountain,
9922 ^ instructed them - jesus,
9926 ^ saying,
9927 ^ to no one tell the vision,
9931 ^ until that the son - of man out from [the] dead is risen.
9940 ^ and asked him the disciples,
9945 ^ saying,
9946 ^ why then the scribes say
9951 ^ that
9952 ^ elijah it behooves to come first?
9956 ^ - and
9958 ^ answering, he said,
9960 ^ elijah indeed comes,
9963 ^ and will restore all things.
9966 ^ i say however to you
9969 ^ that elijah already is come,
9973 ^ and not they knew him,
9977 ^ but did to him
9981 ^ whatever they desired.
9983 ^ thus also, the son - of man is about
9990 ^ to suffer from them.
9993 ^ then understood the disciples
9997 ^ that concerning john the baptist he spoke to them.
10004 ^ and they having come to the crowd,
10009 ^ came to him a man
10012 ^ kneeling down to him
10014 ^ and saying,
10016 ^ lord, have mercy on my - son,
10021 ^ for he is epileptic
10023 ^ and miserably suffers;
10026 ^ often for he falls into the fire,
10032 ^ and often into the water.
10037 ^ and i brought him to the disciples of you,
10043 ^ and not they were able
10046 ^ him to heal.
10048 ^ answering now, - jesus said,
10053 ^ o generation unbelieving
10056 ^ and perverted, how long when with you will i be?
10063 ^ how long when will i bear with you?
10067 ^ bring to me him here.
10071 ^ and rebuked him - jesus,
10076 ^ and went out from him the demon,
10082 ^ and was healed the boy from the hour that.
10090 ^ then
10091 ^ having come the disciples - to jesus in private, they said,
10099 ^ because of why we not were able
10104 ^ to cast out it?
10106 ^ - and he said to them,
10110 ^ because of the little faith of you.
10114 ^ truly for i say to you,
10118 ^ if you have faith as a seed of mustard,
10124 ^ you will say to the mountain to this,
10128 ^ move from here to there,
10131 ^ and it will move.
10133 ^ and nothing will be impossible for you.”
10137 ^ were abiding now they in - galilee,
10143 ^ said to them - jesus,
10147 ^ is about the son - of man
10152 ^ to be betrayed into [the] hands of men,
10156 ^ and they will kill him,
10159 ^ and on the third day he will be raised up.
10164 ^ and they were grieved deeply.
10167 ^ having come now they to capernaum,
10172 ^ came
10173 ^ those the didrachmas
10176 ^ collecting - to peter
10179 ^ and said,
10181 ^ the teacher of you not does he pay the didrachmas?
10188 ^ he says,
10189 ^ yes.
10190 ^ and he having entered into the house,
10195 ^ anticipated him - jesus,
10199 ^ saying,
10200 ^ what you do think, simon?
10204 ^ the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive custom or tribute?
10214 ^ from the sons of them,
10218 ^ or from - strangers?
10222 ^ he having said now,
10224 ^ from the strangers,
10227 ^ said to him - jesus,
10231 ^ then free are the sons.
10236 ^ that however not we might offend them,
10241 ^ having gone to sea, cast a hook,
10246 ^ and the
10248 ^ having come up first fish take,
10252 ^ and
10253 ^ having opened the mouth of it, you will find a four-drachma coin.
10259 ^ that having taken, give to them for me and yourself.
10267 ^ in that - hour came the disciples - to jesus,
10276 ^ saying,
10277 ^ who then [the] greatest is in the kingdom of the heavens?
10286 ^ and
10287 ^ having called to [him] a child, he set it in midst of them,
10294 ^ and said,
10296 ^ truly i say to you,
10299 ^ if not you turn
10302 ^ and become as the little children,
10307 ^ no not shall you enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
10315 ^ whoever therefore will humble himself as the little child this,
10323 ^ he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens.
10332 ^ and
10333 ^ whoever if shall receive one little child such in the name of me, me receives.
10345 ^ whoever then - shall cause to stumble one of the little ones of these
10353 ^ - believing in me,
10357 ^ it is better for him
10359 ^ that should be hung a millstone heavy around the neck of him,
10367 ^ and he be sunk in the depth of the sea.
10374 ^ woe to the world because of the causes of sin.
10380 ^ necessary [are] for
10382 ^ to come the stumbling blocks,
10385 ^ but woe to the man
10389 ^ by whom the offense comes!
10394 ^ if now the hand of you or the foot of you causes to sin you,
10405 ^ cut off it
10407 ^ and cast [it] from you;
10411 ^ better for you it is
10414 ^ to enter into - life crippled or lame,
10421 ^ than
10422 ^ two hands or two feet having, to be cast into the fire - eternal.
10434 ^ and if the eye of you causes to sin you,
10441 ^ gouge out it
10443 ^ and cast [it] from you;
10447 ^ better for you it is
10450 ^ one-eyed into - life to enter,
10455 ^ than
10456 ^ two eyes having to be cast into the hell of the fire.
10465 ^ see [that]
10466 ^ not you despise one of the little ones of these.
10472 ^ i say for to you
10475 ^ that the angels of them in [the] heavens continually always behold the face of the father of me, who [is] in [the] heavens.
10492 ^ what you do think?
10495 ^ if there should be to any man a hundred sheep,
10501 ^ and has gone astray one of them,
10506 ^ not will he leave the ninety nine on the mountains,
10514 ^ and
10515 ^ having gone, seek
10517 ^ the [one] going astray?
10519 ^ and if he should
10522 ^ find it,
10524 ^ truly i say to you
10527 ^ that he rejoices over it
10531 ^ more than over the ninety nine
10537 ^ - not
10539 ^ having gone astray.
10540 ^ thus not it is [the] will of the father of you who [is] in [the] heavens,
10551 ^ that should perish one of the little ones of these.
10557 ^ if now sins against you the brother of you,
10565 ^ go
10566 ^ reprove him, between you and him alone.
10573 ^ if you he will hear,
10576 ^ you have gained the brother of you.
10580 ^ if however not he will hear,
10584 ^ take with you more, one or two,
10591 ^ that upon [the] testimony of two witnesses or of three, may be strengthened every word.’
10601 ^ if now he fails to listen to them,
10605 ^ tell [it] to the church.
10608 ^ if now also to the church he fails to listen,
10614 ^ let him be to you as the pagan and the tax collector.
10622 ^ truly i say to you,
10625 ^ how many if you shall bind on the earth, shall have been
10632 ^ bound in heaven;
10635 ^ and
10636 ^ how many if you shall loose on the earth, shall have been
10643 ^ loosed in heaven.
10646 ^ again truly i say to you
10650 ^ that if two might agree
10654 ^ of you on the earth concerning any matter,
10662 ^ that if they shall ask,
10665 ^ it will be done for them by the father of me who [is] in [the] heavens.
10674 ^ where for are two or three
10680 ^ gathered together unto - my name,
10685 ^ there am i in [the] midst of them.
10690 ^ then
10691 ^ having come, - peter said to him,
10696 ^ lord, how often will sin against me the brother of me,
10704 ^ and i will forgive him?
10707 ^ up to seven times?
10709 ^ says to him - jesus,
10713 ^ not i say to you
10716 ^ up to seven times,
10718 ^ but up to seventy times seven!
10722 ^ because of this, has become like the kingdom of the heavens to a man, a king,
10731 ^ who desired
10733 ^ to settle accounts with the servants of him.
10739 ^ having begun then he
10742 ^ to settle,
10743 ^ was brought to him, one a debtor of ten thousand talents.
10749 ^ nothing having now he
10753 ^ to pay,
10754 ^ commanded
10755 ^ him the master
10758 ^ to be sold, and the wife and the children, and all
10767 ^ as many as he had,
10769 ^ and payment to be made.
10771 ^ having fallen down therefore the servant was bowing on his knees to him,
10777 ^ saying,
10778 ^ have patience with me,
10781 ^ and all i will pay to you.
10785 ^ having been moved with compassion now, the master of the servant that released him,
10794 ^ and the debt forgave him.
10799 ^ having gone out however, the servant same found one the fellow servants of him
10809 ^ who was owing him a hundred denarii,
10814 ^ and
10815 ^ having seized him he was throttling [him],
10818 ^ saying,
10819 ^ pay
10820 ^ if any you owe.’
10823 ^ having fallen down therefore, the fellow servant of him was begging him,
10830 ^ saying,
10831 ^ have patience with me,
10834 ^ and i will pay you.
10837 ^ - but not he was willing,
10841 ^ rather
10842 ^ having gone, he cast him into prison,
10847 ^ until he should pay
10849 ^ that which was owing.
10851 ^ having seen therefore the fellow servants of him
10856 ^ the things having taken place, they were grieved deeply,
10860 ^ and
10861 ^ having gone, narrated to master of themselves all
10867 ^ that having taken place.
10869 ^ then
10870 ^ having called to him, the master of him says to him,
10877 ^ servant evil, all the debt that i forgave you,
10885 ^ because you begged me.
10888 ^ not did it behoove
10890 ^ also you to have pitied the fellow servant of you,
10896 ^ as also i you had pitied?
10900 ^ and
10901 ^ having been angry, the master of him delivered him to the jailers,
10909 ^ until that he should pay
10912 ^ all - being owed.
10915 ^ thus also the father of me - heavenly will do to you,
10924 ^ if not you forgive each the brother of him, from the heart of you.
10935 ^ and it came to pass,
10937 ^ when had finished - jesus the words these,
10944 ^ he withdrew from - galilee
10948 ^ and came to the region - of judea beyond the jordan.
10958 ^ and followed him crowds great,
10963 ^ and he healed them there.
10967 ^ and came to him pharisees,
10971 ^ testing him
10973 ^ and saying,
10975 ^ if is it lawful for a man
10978 ^ to divorce the a wife to him for every cause?
10985 ^ which now
10987 ^ answering, he said,
10989 ^ not have you read
10991 ^ that
10992 ^ the [one] having created, from [the] beginning male and female made them’
11001 ^ and said,
11003 ^ on account of this will leave a man the father and the mother
11012 ^ and be joined with the wife of him,
11017 ^ and will become the two into flesh one’
11024 ^ so that no longer are they two,
11028 ^ but flesh one.
11031 ^ what therefore - god united together, man not let separate.
11039 ^ they say to him,
11041 ^ why then moses did command
11045 ^ to give a roll of divorce,
11048 ^ and to send away her?
11051 ^ he says to them
11053 ^ -, moses in view of the hardness of heart of you allowed you
11061 ^ to divorce the wives of you;
11065 ^ from [the] beginning however not was [it] this way.
11071 ^ i say now to you
11074 ^ that
11075 ^ whoever - shall divorce - wife of him
11081 ^ except for sexual immorality,
11084 ^ and shall marry another, commits adultery.”
11088 ^ say to him the disciples of him
11093 ^ if this is the case of the man with the wife,
11103 ^ not it is better
11105 ^ to marry.
11106 ^ - and he said to them,
11110 ^ not all receive the word this,
11116 ^ but only [those]
11117 ^ to whom it has been given.
11119 ^ there are for eunuchs
11122 ^ who from [the] womb of [their] mother were born thus,
11128 ^ and there are eunuchs
11131 ^ who were made eunuchs by - men,
11136 ^ and there are eunuchs
11139 ^ who made eunuchs of themselves for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens.
11147 ^ the [one] being able
11149 ^ to receive [it], let him receive [it].
11151 ^ then were brought to him little children,
11155 ^ that the hands he might lay on them,
11160 ^ and he might pray.
11162 ^ - however
11164 ^ the disciples rebuked them.
11167 ^ - and
11169 ^ jesus said,
11171 ^ permit the little children,
11174 ^ and not do forbid them
11178 ^ to come to me;
11181 ^ of the for
11183 ^ such kind is the kingdom of the heavens.
11189 ^ and
11190 ^ having laid the hands upon them, he departed from there.
11196 ^ and behold,
11198 ^ one
11199 ^ having come to him, said,
11202 ^ teacher, what good [thing] shall i do,
11206 ^ that i might have life eternal?
11210 ^ - and he said to him,
11214 ^ why me ask you about what is good?
11220 ^ only one is
11222 ^ - good.
11224 ^ if however you desire
11227 ^ into - life to enter,
11231 ^ keep the commandments.
11234 ^ he says to him,
11236 ^ which?
11237 ^ - and
11239 ^ jesus said,
11241 ^ - not
11243 ^ shall you murder,
11244 ^ not shall you commit adultery,
11246 ^ not shall you steal,
11248 ^ not shall you bear false witness,
11250 ^ you shall honor the father and the mother,
11256 ^ and you shall love - neighbor of you
11261 ^ as yourself.’
11263 ^ says to him the young man,
11267 ^ all these things i have kept.
11270 ^ what yet lack i?
11273 ^ was saying to him - jesus,
11277 ^ if you desire
11279 ^ perfect to be,
11281 ^ go,
11282 ^ sell
11283 ^ of you the possessing,
11286 ^ and give to the poor,
11290 ^ and you will have treasure in [the] heavens;
11295 ^ and come,
11297 ^ follow me.
11299 ^ having heard now the young man the statement, he went away
11306 ^ grieving;
11307 ^ he was [one] for
11309 ^ having possessions many.
11312 ^ - and
11314 ^ jesus said to the disciples of him,
11319 ^ truly i say to you
11322 ^ that a rich man with difficulty will enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
11331 ^ again now i say to you,
11335 ^ easier for [it] is
11337 ^ a camel through [the] eye of a needle to go,
11342 ^ than
11343 ^ a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god.
11350 ^ having heard now, the disciples were astonished exceedingly,
11356 ^ saying,
11357 ^ who then is able
11360 ^ to be saved?
11361 ^ having looked on [them] now, - jesus said to them,
11367 ^ with men this impossible is,
11372 ^ with however
11374 ^ god all things [are] possible.
11377 ^ then
11378 ^ answering - peter said to him,
11383 ^ behold,
11384 ^ we left all things
11387 ^ and followed you;
11390 ^ what then will be to us?
11394 ^ - and
11396 ^ jesus said to them,
11399 ^ truly i say to you
11402 ^ that you
11404 ^ - having followed me,
11407 ^ in the regeneration,
11410 ^ when shall sit down the son - of man upon [the] throne of glory of him, will sit also you on twelve thrones,
11426 ^ judging the twelve tribes - of israel.
11432 ^ and everyone
11434 ^ who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for the sake of - name, my a hundredfold will receive,
11455 ^ and life eternal will inherit.
11459 ^ many however will be
11462 ^ first last,
11464 ^ and last first.
11467 ^ like for is the kingdom of the heavens
11474 ^ to a man, a master of a house,
11476 ^ who went out in [the] morning
11480 ^ to hire workmen for the vineyard of him.
11486 ^ having agreed then with the workmen for a denarius for the day, he sent them into the vineyard of him.
11501 ^ and
11502 ^ having gone out about the third hour, he saw others
11508 ^ standing in the marketplace idle,
11513 ^ and to them he said,
11516 ^ go also you into the vineyard,
11522 ^ and
11523 ^ whatever if might be right, i will give you.
11529 ^ - and they went.
11532 ^ again then
11534 ^ having gone out about [the] sixth and ninth hour, he did likewise.
11542 ^ about then
11544 ^ the eleventh,
11546 ^ having gone out, he found others
11549 ^ standing,
11550 ^ and he says to them,
11553 ^ why here stand you all the day idle?
11560 ^ they say to him,
11562 ^ because no one us has hired.
11566 ^ he says to them,
11568 ^ go also you into the vineyard.’
11574 ^ evening then having arrived,
11577 ^ says the master of the vineyard to foreman of him,
11585 ^ call the workmen
11588 ^ and pay them the wages,
11593 ^ having begun from the last unto the first.
11600 ^ and having come those [hired] about the eleventh hour, they received each a denarius.
11610 ^ and
11611 ^ having come the first, they thought
11615 ^ that more they will receive,
11618 ^ but they received those each a denarius
11623 ^ also themselves.
11625 ^ having received, now they were grumbling against the master of the house,
11631 ^ saying,
11632 ^ these the last, one hour have worked,
11638 ^ and equal to us them you have made,
11643 ^ those having borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.
11652 ^ - and
11654 ^ answering to one of them, he said,
11658 ^ friend, not i do wrong you.
11662 ^ not for a denarius did you agree with me?
11666 ^ take what [is] yours
11669 ^ and go.
11671 ^ i desire now
11673 ^ to this - last to give,
11677 ^ as also to you.
11680 ^ or not is it lawful for me
11684 ^ what i will to do with that which [is] mine?
11690 ^ or the eye of you envious is,
11696 ^ because i generous am?
11700 ^ thus will be the last first,
11705 ^ and the first, last.”
11709 ^ and
11710 ^ going up - jesus to jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside themselves,
11721 ^ and on the way he said to them,
11727 ^ behold,
11728 ^ we go up to jerusalem,
11731 ^ and the son - of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and scribes,
11741 ^ and they will condemn him [to] death,
11745 ^ and they will betray him the gentiles
11750 ^ unto, - to mock
11753 ^ and to flog
11755 ^ and to crucify;
11757 ^ and the third day he will rise again.
11762 ^ then came to him the mother of the sons of zebedee with the sons of her,
11774 ^ kneeling down,
11775 ^ and asking something from him.
11780 ^ - and he said to her,
11784 ^ what do you desire?
11786 ^ she says to him,
11788 ^ say
11789 ^ that might sit these - two sons of mine,
11796 ^ one on [the] right hand of you
11800 ^ and one on [the] left hand of you, in the kingdom of you.
11809 ^ answering now, - jesus said,
11814 ^ not you know
11816 ^ what you ask for.
11818 ^ are you able
11819 ^ to drink the cup
11822 ^ which i am about
11825 ^ to drink?”
11826 ^ they say to him,
11828 ^ we are able.
11829 ^ he says to them,
11831 ^ - indeed
11833 ^ the cup of me you will drink,
11836 ^ - but to sit on [the] right hand of me and on [the] left, not is
11847 ^ mine this to give,
11850 ^ but [to those]
11851 ^ for whom it has been prepared by the father of me.
11857 ^ and
11858 ^ having heard [this], the ten were indignant about the two brothers.
11866 ^ - and
11868 ^ jesus,
11869 ^ having called to [him] them, said,
11872 ^ you know
11873 ^ that the rulers of the gentiles exercise lordship over them,
11880 ^ and the great ones exercise authority over them.
11885 ^ not thus will it be among you;
11890 ^ but
11891 ^ whoever if wishes
11894 ^ among you great to become, he will be your servant;
11901 ^ and
11902 ^ whoever - wishes
11905 ^ among you to be first, he will be your slave;
11912 ^ even as the son - of man not came to be served,
11920 ^ but
11921 ^ to serve,
11922 ^ and to give the life of him [as] a ransom for many.
11930 ^ and [as] were going out they from jericho,
11935 ^ followed him a crowd great.
11939 ^ and behold,
11941 ^ two blind [men]
11943 ^ sitting beside the road,
11947 ^ having heard
11948 ^ that jesus is passing by, cried out,
11952 ^ saying,
11953 ^ have mercy on us, lord, son of david.
11958 ^ - and
11960 ^ the crowd rebuked them,
11963 ^ that they should be silent.
11965 ^ - but all the more they cried out,
11969 ^ saying,
11970 ^ have mercy on us, lord, son of david.
11975 ^ and
11976 ^ having stopped, - jesus called them
11981 ^ and said,
11983 ^ what do you desire i should do unto you?
11987 ^ they say to him,
11989 ^ lord, that might be opened the eyes of us.
11995 ^ having been moved with compassion then, - jesus touched the eyes of them;
12003 ^ and immediately they received sight,
12006 ^ and they followed him.
12009 ^ and when they drew near to jerusalem
12014 ^ and came to bethphage on the mount - of olives,
12023 ^ then jesus sent two disciples,
12028 ^ saying to them,
12030 ^ go into the village - in front of you,
12037 ^ and immediately you will find a donkey
12041 ^ having been tied, and a colt with her;
12046 ^ having untied [them], bring [them] to me.
12049 ^ and if anyone to you says anything,
12055 ^ you will say
12056 ^ that the lord of them need has.
12062 ^ immediately then he will send them.
12066 ^ this then came to pass
12069 ^ that it might be fulfilled
12071 ^ that having been spoken by the prophet,
12076 ^ saying,
12077 ^ say to the daughter of zion,
12081 ^ behold,
12082 ^ the king of you comes to you, gentle and
12089 ^ mounted on a donkey, even upon a colt, [the] foal of a beast of burden.’”
12097 ^ having gone then the disciples
12101 ^ and having done
12103 ^ as commanded them - jesus,
12108 ^ they brought the donkey and the colt,
12114 ^ and put upon them their cloaks,
12120 ^ and he sat on them.
12124 ^ the now
12126 ^ very great crowd spread their the cloaks on the road;
12135 ^ others now were cutting down branches from the trees
12142 ^ and were spreading [them] on the road.
12147 ^ the now
12149 ^ crowds
12150 ^ - going before him
12153 ^ and those following were crying out,
12157 ^ saying:
12158 ^ hosanna to the son of david!”
12162 ^ blessed is
12163 ^ the [one] coming in [the] name of [the] lord!”
12168 ^ hosanna in the highest!”
12172 ^ and having entered of him into jerusalem,
12177 ^ was stirred all the city,
12181 ^ saying,
12182 ^ who is this?
12185 ^ - and
12187 ^ the crowds were saying,
12189 ^ this is the prophet, jesus, the [one] from nazareth - of galilee.
12199 ^ and entered jesus into the temple
12205 ^ and cast out all
12208 ^ those selling
12210 ^ and buying in the temple,
12215 ^ and the tables of the money changers he overturned,
12221 ^ and the seats
12224 ^ of those selling the doves.
12228 ^ and he says to them,
12231 ^ it has been written:
12232 ^ the house of me a house of prayer will be called.’
12238 ^ you however it have made a den of robbers.’
12244 ^ and came to him blind and lame in the temple,
12253 ^ and he healed them.
12256 ^ having seen now the chief priests and the scribes the wonders
12265 ^ that he did and the children
12270 ^ the crying out in the temple
12275 ^ and saying,
12277 ^ hosanna to the son of david, they were indignant
12282 ^ and said to him,
12285 ^ hear you
12286 ^ what these say?
12289 ^ - and
12291 ^ jesus says to them,
12294 ^ yes,
12295 ^ never did you read
12297 ^ -: out of [the] mouth of babes
12301 ^ and sucklings, you have prepared for yourself praise’
12305 ^ and
12306 ^ having left them, he went out of the city to bethany,
12314 ^ and he passed the night there.
12317 ^ in the morning then,
12319 ^ having come back into the city, he became hungry.
12324 ^ and
12325 ^ having seen fig tree one along the road, he came to it
12334 ^ and nothing found on it,
12339 ^ if not leaves only.
12343 ^ and he says to it,
12346 ^ no more from you fruit let there be, to the age.
12354 ^ and withered immediately the fig tree.
12359 ^ and
12360 ^ having seen [it], the disciples marveled,
12364 ^ saying,
12365 ^ how so quickly withered the fig tree?
12370 ^ answering now, - jesus said to them,
12376 ^ truly i say to you,
12379 ^ if you have faith
12382 ^ and not do doubt,
12385 ^ not only the [miracle] of the fig tree will you do,
12391 ^ but even if to the mountain this you should say,
12397 ^ be you taken away
12398 ^ and be you cast into the sea,
12403 ^ it will come to pass.
12404 ^ and all things
12406 ^ as many as - you might ask in - prayer,
12412 ^ believing, you will receive.
12414 ^ and having come of him into the temple,
12420 ^ came to him
12422 ^ teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people,
12430 ^ saying,
12431 ^ by what authority these things are you doing?
12436 ^ and who to you gave the authority this?
12443 ^ answering now, - jesus said to them,
12449 ^ will ask you i also thing one,
12454 ^ which if you tell me,
12458 ^ i also to you will say
12461 ^ by what authority these things i do.
12466 ^ the baptism of john, from where was it?
12472 ^ from heaven,
12474 ^ or from men?
12477 ^ - and they were reasoning with themselves,
12482 ^ saying,
12483 ^ if we should say,
12485 ^ from heaven,
12487 ^ he will say to us,
12489 ^ because of why then not did you believe him?
12495 ^ if however we should say,
12498 ^ from men,
12500 ^ we fear the multitude;
12503 ^ all for as a prophet hold - john.
12510 ^ and
12511 ^ answering - jesus, they said,
12515 ^ not do we know.
12517 ^ said to them also he,
12521 ^ neither i tell you
12525 ^ by what authority these things i do.
12530 ^ what however you think?
12534 ^ a man had sons two,
12538 ^ and
12539 ^ having come to the first he said,
12543 ^ son, go today,
12546 ^ work in the vineyard.
12550 ^ - and
12552 ^ answering he said,
12554 ^ not will i.
12556 ^ afterward however,
12558 ^ having repented, he went.
12560 ^ having come then to the other, he said likewise.
12566 ^ - and
12568 ^ answering he said,
12570 ^ i [will] sir,
12572 ^ and not did he go.
12575 ^ which of the two did the will of the father?
12584 ^ they say,
12585 ^ the first.
12587 ^ says to them - jesus,
12591 ^ truly i say to you
12594 ^ that the tax collectors and the prostitutes go before you into the kingdom - of god.
12607 ^ came for john to you in [the] way of righteousness,
12615 ^ and not you did believe him,
12619 ^ - however
12621 ^ the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him;
12627 ^ you then,
12629 ^ having seen, not even did repent afterward
12633 ^ - to believe him.
12636 ^ another parable hear:
12639 ^ a man there was,
12641 ^ a master of a house,
12642 ^ who planted a vineyard,
12645 ^ and a fence it placed around,
12649 ^ and dug in it a winepress,
12654 ^ and built a tower,
12657 ^ and rented out it to farmers,
12661 ^ and traveled abroad.
12663 ^ when then drew near the season of the fruits,
12670 ^ he sent the servants of him to the farmers
12677 ^ to receive the fruits of him.
12681 ^ and
12682 ^ having taken the farmers the servants of him, one - they beat,
12691 ^ one then they killed,
12694 ^ one then they stoned.
12697 ^ again he sent other servants, more than the first,
12704 ^ and they did to them likewise.
12708 ^ afterward then, he sent to them the son of him,
12716 ^ saying,
12717 ^ they will respect the son of me.
12721 ^ - but
12723 ^ the farmers
12724 ^ having seen the son, said among themselves,
12730 ^ this is the heir;
12734 ^ come,
12735 ^ let us kill him
12737 ^ and gain possession of the inheritance of him.
12742 ^ and
12743 ^ having taking him, they cast [him] out of the vineyard
12749 ^ and killed [him].
12751 ^ when therefore shall come the master of the vineyard,
12758 ^ what will he do the farmers to those?
12763 ^ they say to him,
12765 ^ [the] wretches, grievously he will destroy
12768 ^ them,
12769 ^ and the vineyard he will rent out to other farmers,
12775 ^ who will give to him the fruits in the seasons of them.
12784 ^ says to them - jesus,
12788 ^ never did you read in the scriptures:
12793 ^ [the] stone
12794 ^ which rejected
12796 ^ those building,
12798 ^ this has become the chief corner.
12803 ^ from [the] lord was this,
12807 ^ and it is marvelous in [the] eyes of us?’
12813 ^ because of this i say to you
12817 ^ that will be taken away from you the kingdom - of god,
12825 ^ and it will be given to a people
12828 ^ producing the fruits of it.
12832 ^ and
12833 ^ the [one] having fallen on the stone this will be broken;
12840 ^ on whomever but - it shall fall,
12845 ^ it will grind to powder him.
12847 ^ and
12848 ^ having heard the chief priests and the pharisees the parables of him, they knew
12858 ^ that about them he speaks.
12862 ^ and
12863 ^ seeking
12864 ^ him to lay hold of, they feared the crowds,
12869 ^ because as a prophet him they were holding.
12874 ^ and
12875 ^ answering, - jesus again spoke in parables to them,
12883 ^ saying,
12884 ^ has become like the kingdom of the heavens to a man, a king,
12891 ^ who made a wedding feast for the son of him.
12897 ^ and he sent the servants of him
12902 ^ to call
12903 ^ those having been invited to the wedding feast,
12908 ^ and not they were willing
12911 ^ to come.
12912 ^ again he sent other servants,
12916 ^ saying,
12917 ^ say
12918 ^ to those having been invited,
12920 ^ behold,
12921 ^ the dinner of me i have prepared,
12925 ^ the oxen of me and the fatlings
12931 ^ have been killed,
12932 ^ and all things [are] ready;
12935 ^ come to the wedding feast.
12939 ^ - and
12941 ^ having paid no attention they went away,
12943 ^ one - to the own field,
12949 ^ one then to the business of him.
12955 ^ - and
12957 ^ the rest,
12958 ^ having laid hold of the servants of him, mistreated
12963 ^ and killed [them].
12965 ^ - and
12967 ^ the king was angry,
12969 ^ and
12970 ^ having sent the armies of him, he destroyed the murderers those,
12978 ^ and the city of them he burned.
12983 ^ then he says to servants of him,
12988 ^ the indeed
12990 ^ wedding feast ready is;
12993 ^ those however having been invited not were worthy.
12999 ^ go therefore into the thoroughfares of the highways,
13006 ^ and
13007 ^ as many as if you shall find, invite to the wedding feast.
13014 ^ and
13015 ^ having gone out the servants those into the highways, they brought together all
13024 ^ as many as they found, evil both and good;
13030 ^ and became full the wedding hall
13034 ^ of those reclining.
13035 ^ having entered in then the king
13039 ^ to see
13040 ^ those reclining, he beheld there a man
13045 ^ not being dressed in clothes of wedding;
13049 ^ and he says to him,
13052 ^ friend, how did you enter here
13056 ^ not having garment of wedding?
13060 ^ - and he was speechless.
13063 ^ then the king said to the servants,
13069 ^ having bound his feet and hands, cast out him into the darkness - outer;
13081 ^ there will be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.
13090 ^ many for are called,
13094 ^ few however chosen.
13097 ^ then
13098 ^ having gone out, the pharisees counsel took
13103 ^ how him they might trap in his words.
13108 ^ and they send to him the disciples of them, with the herodians,
13117 ^ saying,
13118 ^ teacher, we know
13120 ^ that true you are,
13123 ^ and the way - of god in [the] truth you teach,
13131 ^ and not there is care to you about no one,
13137 ^ not for you look on [the] appearance of men.
13143 ^ tell therefore us
13146 ^ what you think?
13149 ^ is it lawful
13150 ^ to give tribute to caesar,
13153 ^ or not?
13155 ^ having known however - jesus the malice of them, he said,
13163 ^ why me do you test, hypocrites?
13167 ^ show me the coin of the tribute.
13173 ^ - and they presented to him a denarius.
13178 ^ and he says to them,
13181 ^ whose [is] the likeness this?
13185 ^ and whose inscription?
13188 ^ they say to him
13190 ^ caesar’s.
13191 ^ then he says to them,
13194 ^ give back therefore the things of caesar to caesar,
13199 ^ and the things - of god - to god.
13205 ^ and
13206 ^ having heard, they marveled;
13208 ^ and
13209 ^ having left him, they went away. on that - day
13216 ^ came to him sadducees,
13219 ^ those saying
13220 ^ not there is a resurrection,
13223 ^ and they questioned him,
13226 ^ saying,
13227 ^ teacher, moses said,
13230 ^ if anyone should die
13233 ^ not having children,
13236 ^ will marry the brother of him the wife of him,
13243 ^ and he will raise up offspring for the brother of him.
13249 ^ there were now among us seven brothers;
13255 ^ and the first,
13258 ^ having married, died,
13260 ^ and
13261 ^ not having seed, he left the wife of him to the brother of him.
13271 ^ likewise also the second,
13275 ^ and the third,
13278 ^ unto the seventh.
13281 ^ last then
13283 ^ of all, died the woman.
13287 ^ in the resurrection, therefore, of which of the seven will she be
13295 ^ wife?
13296 ^ all for had her.
13300 ^ answering now, - jesus said to them,
13306 ^ you err,
13307 ^ not knowing the scriptures,
13311 ^ nor the power - of god.
13316 ^ in for
13318 ^ the resurrection, neither do they marry,
13322 ^ nor are given in marriage,
13324 ^ but like angels in - heaven they are.
13331 ^ concerning now
13333 ^ the resurrection of the dead, not have you read
13339 ^ that which has been spoken to you by - god,
13345 ^ saying,
13346 ^ i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob?’
13359 ^ not he is the god of [the] dead,
13364 ^ but
13365 ^ of [the] living.
13366 ^ and
13367 ^ having heard, the crowds were astonished at the teaching of him.
13375 ^ - and
13377 ^ the pharisees,
13378 ^ having heard
13379 ^ that he had silenced the sadducees, were gathered together the same.
13387 ^ and questioned [him] one of them, a lawyer,
13393 ^ testing him,
13395 ^ teacher, which commandment [is the] greatest in the law?
13402 ^ - and he said to him,
13406 ^ you shall love [the] lord the god of you with all the heart of you, and with all the soul of you, and with all the mind of you.’
13428 ^ this is the great and first commandment.
13435 ^ [the] second also [is] like it:
13439 ^ you shall love the neighbor of you
13443 ^ as yourself.’
13445 ^ on these - two commandments, all the law hangs
13454 ^ and the prophets.
13457 ^ having been assembled together now the pharisees,
13461 ^ questioned them - jesus,
13465 ^ saying,
13466 ^ what you think concerning the christ?
13472 ^ of whom son is he?
13475 ^ they say to him,
13477 ^ - of david.
13479 ^ he says to them,
13481 ^ how then, david in spirit does call him lord,
13489 ^ saying:
13490 ^ said the lord to the lord of me,
13495 ^ sit on [the] right hand of me,
13499 ^ until - i place the enemies of you [as] a footstool for the feet of you.”’
13509 ^ if therefore david calls him lord,
13515 ^ how son of him is he?
13519 ^ and no one was able
13522 ^ to answer him a word,
13525 ^ nor dared anyone from that - day
13532 ^ to question him no longer.
13535 ^ then - jesus spoke to the crowds and to disciples of him,
13545 ^ saying,
13546 ^ on - moses’ seat have sat down the scribes and the pharisees.
13556 ^ all things therefore,
13558 ^ how many if they might tell you, keep
13563 ^ and observe.
13565 ^ after however
13567 ^ the works of them, not do.
13572 ^ they speak for,
13574 ^ and not act.
13577 ^ they tie up - burdens heavy and hard to bear
13583 ^ and lay [them] on the shoulders - of men;
13590 ^ themselves however,
13592 ^ with finger of them, not are they willing to move them.
13599 ^ all now
13601 ^ the deeds of them, they do
13605 ^ in order - to be seen - by men.
13610 ^ they broaden for the phylacteries of them,
13615 ^ and enlarge their tassels.
13619 ^ they love now the chief place at the banquets,
13626 ^ and the first seats in the synagogues,
13632 ^ and the greetings in the marketplaces,
13638 ^ and
13639 ^ to be called by - men, rabbi.
13644 ^ you however not shall be called rabbi;
13649 ^ one for is of you the teacher,
13655 ^ all now
13657 ^ you brothers are.
13660 ^ and father no [one] call
13664 ^ of you on the earth;
13668 ^ one for is of you the father, who [is] in heaven.
13676 ^ neither be called instructors,
13679 ^ since [the] instructor of you is one, the christ.
13686 ^ - and
13688 ^ the greatest among you will be your servant.
13693 ^ he who then shall exalt himself will be humbled,
13698 ^ and
13699 ^ whoever shall humble himself will be exalted.
13703 ^ woe however to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites!
13710 ^ for you shut up the kingdom of the heavens before - men;
13719 ^ you for neither enter,
13723 ^ nor even
13724 ^ those who are entering do you allow
13727 ^ to go in.
13728 ^ woe to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites!
13734 ^ for you traverse the sea and the dry [land]
13741 ^ to make one convert,
13744 ^ and when he has become [so],
13747 ^ you make him a son of hell twofold more than yourselves.
13753 ^ woe to you, guides blind,
13757 ^ those saying,
13759 ^ whoever - shall swear by the temple, nothing it is;
13767 ^ whoever however - shall swear by the gold of the temple
13776 ^ is bound by his oath.
13777 ^ foolish and blind! which for greater is,
13784 ^ the gold,
13786 ^ or the temple
13789 ^ - having sanctified the gold?
13793 ^ and [you say],
13794 ^ whoever - shall swear by the altar, nothing it is;
13802 ^ whoever however - shall swear by the gift that [is] upon it,
13812 ^ he is bound by his oath.
13813 ^ you blind men! which for [is] greater,
13817 ^ the gift,
13819 ^ or the altar
13822 ^ - sanctifying the gift?
13826 ^ the [one] therefore having sworn by the altar swears by it and by all things that [are] upon it.
13841 ^ and
13842 ^ the [one] having sworn by the temple swears by it
13850 ^ and by the [one] dwelling in it.
13855 ^ and
13856 ^ the [one] having sworn by - heaven swears by the throne - of god
13867 ^ and by the [one] sitting upon it.
13873 ^ woe to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites!
13879 ^ for you pay tithes of - mint, and - dill, and - cumin;
13889 ^ and you have neglected the weightier [matters] of the law: - justice and - mercy and - faithfulness.
13903 ^ these now it behooved you
13906 ^ to do,
13907 ^ those not to be leaving aside.
13910 ^ guides blind!
13912 ^ those straining out the gnat,
13916 ^ the however
13918 ^ camel swallowing!
13920 ^ woe to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites!
13926 ^ for you cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish;
13935 ^ inside, however, they are full of greed and self-indulgence.
13942 ^ pharisee blind! cleanse first the inside of the cup
13950 ^ that might become also the outside of them clean.
13957 ^ woe to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites!
13963 ^ for you are like tombs
13966 ^ having been whitewashed,
13967 ^ which outwardly indeed appear beautiful.
13972 ^ inside however they are full of bones of [the] dead, and of all impurity.
13980 ^ thus also, you outwardly indeed appear - to men righteous,
13989 ^ inwardly however you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
13996 ^ woe to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites!
14002 ^ for you build the tombs of the prophets
14008 ^ and adorn the monuments of the righteous;
14014 ^ and you say,
14016 ^ if we had lived in the days of the fathers of us,
14024 ^ not - we would have been with them partakers in the blood of the prophets.
14034 ^ thus you bear witness to yourselves
14037 ^ that sons you are
14040 ^ of those having murdered the prophets.
14044 ^ and you, fill up the measure of the fathers of you.
14052 ^ serpents! offspring of vipers! how shall you escape from the sentence - of hell?
14062 ^ because of this, behold,
14065 ^ i send to you prophets and wise [men] and scribes.
14074 ^ some of them you will kill
14077 ^ and will crucify,
14079 ^ and [some] of them you will flog in the synagogues of you,
14087 ^ and will persecute from town to town;
14093 ^ so that shall come upon you all [the] blood righteous
14100 ^ being poured out upon the earth, from the blood of abel the righteous, to the blood of zechariah son of berekiah,
14116 ^ whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
14124 ^ truly i say to you,
14127 ^ will come these things all upon the generation this.
14134 ^ jerusalem, jerusalem,
14136 ^ - killing the prophets
14140 ^ and stoning
14142 ^ those having been sent to her! how often would i
14148 ^ have gathered together the children of you,
14152 ^ in which way a hen gathers together the chicks of her under the wings,
14162 ^ and not you were willing!
14165 ^ behold,
14166 ^ is left to you the house of you desolate!
14172 ^ i say for to you,
14175 ^ no not me shall you see from now
14181 ^ until - you say,
14184 ^ blessed [is]
14185 ^ the [one] coming in [the] name of [the] lord.’
14190 ^ and
14191 ^ having gone forth - jesus from the temple, he was going away,
14198 ^ and came to [him] the disciples of him
14203 ^ to point out to him the buildings of the temple.
14209 ^ - and
14211 ^ answering, he said to them,
14214 ^ not do you see these things all?
14218 ^ truly i say to you,
14221 ^ none not even shall be left here stone upon stone,
14228 ^ which not will be thrown down.
14231 ^ [as] was sitting now he upon the mount - of olives,
14239 ^ came to him the disciples in private,
14245 ^ saying,
14246 ^ tell us,
14248 ^ when these things will be?
14251 ^ and what [is] the sign - of your coming and of the consummation of the age?
14262 ^ and
14263 ^ answering, - jesus said to them,
14268 ^ take heed,
14269 ^ lest anyone you mislead.
14273 ^ many for will come in the name of me,
14280 ^ saying,
14281 ^ i am the christ,
14285 ^ and many they will mislead.
14288 ^ you will begin then
14290 ^ to hear of wars and rumors of wars.
14295 ^ behold,
14296 ^ not be alarmed;
14298 ^ it is necessary for
14300 ^ to take place,
14301 ^ but not yet is the end.
14306 ^ will rise up for nation against nation,
14311 ^ and kingdom against kingdom;
14315 ^ and there will be famines and earthquakes in [various] places.
14322 ^ all then
14324 ^ these [are] [the] beginning of birth pains.
14327 ^ then will they deliver you to tribulation,
14332 ^ and will kill you,
14335 ^ and you will be
14337 ^ hated by all the nations on account of the name of me.
14346 ^ and then will fall away many,
14350 ^ and one another they will betray,
14353 ^ and will hate one another;
14356 ^ and many false prophets will arise
14360 ^ and will mislead many.
14363 ^ and
14364 ^ because - is to be multiplied - lawlessness, will grow cold the love of the many.
14374 ^ the [one] however having endured to [the] end,
14379 ^ he will be saved.
14381 ^ and there will be proclaimed this - gospel of the kingdom in all the earth, for a testimony to all the nations;
14397 ^ and then will come the end.
14402 ^ when therefore you shall see the abomination - of desolation,’
14409 ^ - having been spoken of by daniel the prophet,
14415 ^ standing in [the] place holy —
14419 ^ the [one] reading let him understand —
14422 ^ then those in - judea, let them flee to the mountains;
14431 ^ the [one] on the housetop, not let him come down
14437 ^ to take anything out of the house of him;
14443 ^ and the [one] in the field, neither let him return back
14451 ^ to take the cloak of him.
14455 ^ woe then
14457 ^ to those in womb
14460 ^ having,
14461 ^ and to the [ones] nursing infants in those the days.
14468 ^ pray however
14470 ^ that not might be the flight of you in winter,
14477 ^ nor on a sabbath.
14479 ^ there will be for then tribulation great,
14484 ^ such as not has been from [the] beginning of [the] world until - now,
14493 ^ no never not shall be.
14497 ^ and if not had been shortened the days those,
14504 ^ not - there would have been saved any flesh;
14509 ^ because of however
14511 ^ the elect, will be shortened the days those.
14517 ^ then if anyone to you says,
14522 ^ behold,
14523 ^ here [is] the christ,
14526 ^ or here,
14528 ^ not believe [it].
14530 ^ there will arise for false christs and false prophets,
14535 ^ and they will give signs great, and wonders,
14541 ^ so as to mislead,
14543 ^ if possible, even the elect.
14548 ^ behold,
14549 ^ i have foretold [it] to you.
14551 ^ if therefore they say to you,
14555 ^ behold,
14556 ^ in the wilderness he is,
14560 ^ not go forth;
14562 ^ [or] ‘behold,
14563 ^ in the inner rooms,
14566 ^ not believe [it].
14568 ^ just as for the lightning comes forth from [the] east
14575 ^ and shines as far as [the] west,
14579 ^ so will be the coming of the son - of man.
14587 ^ for wherever if may be the carcass,
14592 ^ there will be gathered the vultures.
14596 ^ immediately then after the tribulation the days of those: the sun will be darkened,
14607 ^ and the moon not will give the light of it,
14615 ^ and the stars will fall from the sky,
14622 ^ and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.’
14628 ^ and then will appear the sign of the son - of man in heaven,
14639 ^ and then will mourn all the tribes of the earth,
14647 ^ and they will see the son - of man
14653 ^ coming on the clouds - of heaven with power and glory great.
14664 ^ and he will send the angels of him with a trumpet call great,
14672 ^ and they will gather together the elect of him, from the four winds, from [the] ends of the heavens to the ends of them.
14688 ^ of now
14690 ^ the fig tree learn the parable:
14695 ^ when already the branch of it may have become tender
14702 ^ and the leaves it puts forth,
14706 ^ you know
14707 ^ that near [is] the summer.
14711 ^ thus also you,
14714 ^ when you see all these things, know
14719 ^ that near he is, at [the] doors.
14724 ^ truly i say to you
14727 ^ that no not will have passed away the generation this
14734 ^ until - all these things shall have taken place.
14739 ^ the heaven and the earth will pass away,
14745 ^ - but
14747 ^ the words of me no not shall pass away.
14752 ^ concerning however
14754 ^ the day that and hour, no one knows,
14761 ^ not even the angels of the heavens,
14766 ^ nor the son,
14769 ^ if not the father only.
14774 ^ as [were] for the days - of noah,
14780 ^ so will be the coming of the son - of man.
14788 ^ as for they were in the days those - before the flood,
14799 ^ eating
14800 ^ and drinking,
14802 ^ marrying
14803 ^ and giving in marriage,
14805 ^ until that day entered noah into the ark.
14813 ^ and not they knew,
14816 ^ until came the flood
14820 ^ and took away all;
14823 ^ thus will be also the coming of the son - of man.
14832 ^ then two will be in the field:
14838 ^ one is taken,
14840 ^ and one is left.
14843 ^ two [women]
14844 ^ will be grinding at the mill:
14848 ^ one is taken,
14850 ^ and one is left.
14853 ^ keep watch therefore,
14855 ^ for not you know
14858 ^ on what day the lord of you comes.
14864 ^ this then know,
14867 ^ that if had known the master of the house
14872 ^ in what time of night the thief comes,
14877 ^ he would have watched -
14879 ^ and not - have allowed
14883 ^ to be broken into the house of him.
14887 ^ because of this also, you be ready,
14893 ^ for
14894 ^ in that not you expect
14897 ^ hour, the son - of man comes.
14903 ^ who then is the faithful servant, and wise,
14911 ^ whom has set the master over the household of him,
14919 ^ - to give to them the food in season?
14926 ^ blessed [is] the servant that,
14930 ^ whom
14931 ^ having come, the master of him will find
14936 ^ thus doing.
14938 ^ truly i say to you
14941 ^ that
14942 ^ over all the possessing of him he will set him.
14949 ^ if however should say the evil servant that in the heart of him,
14960 ^ delays of me the master,
14964 ^ and should begin
14966 ^ to beat the fellow servants of him,
14970 ^ to eat then
14972 ^ and to drink
14974 ^ with those being drunkards,
14977 ^ will come the master the servant of that in a day
14985 ^ in which not he does expect, and in an hour
14991 ^ which not he is aware,
14994 ^ and will cut in pieces him,
14997 ^ and the place of him with the hypocrites will appoint;
15005 ^ there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
15014 ^ then will be likened the kingdom of the heavens to ten virgins,
15022 ^ who
15023 ^ having taken the lamps of them, went forth to meet the bridegroom.
15032 ^ five now
15034 ^ of them were foolish,
15038 ^ and five wise.
15041 ^ the for
15043 ^ foolish,
15044 ^ having taken the lamps of them, not did take with them oil;
15053 ^ - but
15055 ^ the wise took oil in the vessels, with the lamps of them.
15065 ^ tarrying then the bridegroom,
15069 ^ they became drowsy all
15071 ^ and were sleeping.
15073 ^ at middle then
15075 ^ of [the] night, a cry there was:
15078 ^ behold,
15079 ^ the bridegroom!
15081 ^ go forth to meet him!
15085 ^ then arose all the virgins those
15091 ^ and trimmed the lamps of them.
15096 ^ - and
15098 ^ the foolish to the wise said,
15102 ^ give us of the oil of you,
15108 ^ for the lamps of us are going out.
15113 ^ answered then the wise,
15117 ^ saying,
15118 ^ lest no not even it might suffice for us and you.
15125 ^ go rather
15127 ^ to those selling,
15130 ^ and buy for yourselves.
15133 ^ [while] are going away then they
15136 ^ to buy,
15137 ^ came the bridegroom,
15140 ^ and those ready went in with him to the wedding feast;
15149 ^ and was shut the door.
15153 ^ afterward then come also the other virgins,
15160 ^ saying,
15161 ^ lord, lord, open to us!
15165 ^ - and
15167 ^ answering he said,
15169 ^ truly i say to you,
15172 ^ not i do know you.
15175 ^ watch therefore,
15177 ^ for neither do you know the day,
15182 ^ nor the hour.
15185 ^ [it is] like for a man
15188 ^ going on a journey [who] called the own servants,
15193 ^ and delivered to them
15196 ^ the possessing of him.
15199 ^ and to one indeed he gave five talents,
15205 ^ to one then two,
15208 ^ to one then one,
15211 ^ to each according to the own ability;
15216 ^ and he left the region
15218 ^ immediately.
15219 ^ having gone,
15220 ^ the [one] the five talents
15224 ^ having received traded with them
15228 ^ and made more five.
15232 ^ likewise, the [one with] the two gained more two.
15239 ^ the [one] however - one having received,
15244 ^ having gone away, dug in the ground
15247 ^ and hid the money of the master of him.
15254 ^ after then
15256 ^ much time, comes the master of the servants those
15264 ^ and takes account with them.
15269 ^ and
15270 ^ having come,
15271 ^ the [one] the five talents
15275 ^ having received brought to [him] other five talents,
15280 ^ saying,
15281 ^ master, five talents to me you did deliver.
15286 ^ behold,
15287 ^ more five talents have i gained.
15291 ^ said to him the master of him,
15296 ^ well done, servant good and faithful!
15301 ^ over a few things you were faithful;
15305 ^ over many things you will i set.
15309 ^ enter into the joy of the master of you!
15316 ^ having come then also the [one] with the two talents, he said,
15324 ^ master, two talents to me you did deliver.
15329 ^ behold,
15330 ^ more two talents have i gained.
15334 ^ said to him the master of him,
15339 ^ well done, servant good and faithful!
15344 ^ over a few things you were faithful;
15348 ^ over many things you will i set.
15352 ^ enter into the joy of the master of you!
15359 ^ having come then also
15362 ^ the [one] the one talent
15366 ^ having received, he said,
15368 ^ master, i knew you,
15371 ^ that hard you are
15374 ^ a man,
15375 ^ reaping
15376 ^ where not you did sow,
15379 ^ and gathering
15381 ^ from where not you did scatter.
15384 ^ and
15385 ^ having been afraid,
15386 ^ having gone away, i hid the talent of you in the ground.
15394 ^ behold,
15395 ^ you have what [is] yours.
15398 ^ answering now, the master of him said to him,
15405 ^ wicked servant and lazy! you knew
15410 ^ that i reap
15412 ^ where not i sowed,
15415 ^ and gather
15417 ^ from where not i scattered.
15420 ^ it behooved
15421 ^ you therefore to put the money of me to the bankers,
15429 ^ and
15430 ^ having come, i would have received - - my own with interest.
15438 ^ take therefore from him the talent,
15444 ^ and give [it]
15446 ^ to the [one] having the ten talents.
15451 ^ - for having, to everyone will be given,
15456 ^ and he will have in abundance;
15458 ^ the [one] however not having,
15462 ^ even
15463 ^ that which he has will be taken away from him.
15468 ^ and the worthless servant, cast out into the darkness - outer;
15478 ^ there will be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.
15487 ^ when then comes the son - of man in the glory of him,
15498 ^ and all the angels with him,
15504 ^ then he will sit upon [the] throne of glory of him.
15510 ^ and will be gathered before him all the nations,
15517 ^ and he will separate them from one another,
15522 ^ as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
15531 ^ and he will set - indeed
15535 ^ the sheep on [the] right hand of him,
15539 ^ - and
15541 ^ the goats on [the] left.
15544 ^ then will say the king to those on [the] right hand of him,
15552 ^ come,
15553 ^ those being blessed of the father of me,
15558 ^ inherit the having been prepared for you kingdom from [the] foundation of [the] world.
15566 ^ i hungered for,
15568 ^ and you gave me
15571 ^ to eat;
15572 ^ i thirsted,
15573 ^ and you gave to drink me;
15576 ^ a stranger i was,
15578 ^ and you took in me;
15581 ^ naked,
15582 ^ and you clothed me;
15585 ^ i was sick,
15586 ^ and you visited me;
15589 ^ in prison i was,
15592 ^ and you came to me.
15596 ^ then will answer him the righteous,
15601 ^ saying,
15602 ^ lord, when you saw we
15606 ^ hungering,
15607 ^ and fed [you]?
15609 ^ or
15610 ^ thirsting,
15611 ^ and gave [you] to drink?
15613 ^ when now you saw we
15617 ^ a stranger,
15618 ^ and took [you] in?
15620 ^ or naked,
15622 ^ and clothed [you]?
15624 ^ when now you saw we
15628 ^ ailing
15629 ^ or in prison,
15632 ^ and came to you?
15636 ^ and
15637 ^ answering, the king will say to them,
15642 ^ truly i say to you,
15645 ^ to the extent as much as you did [it] to one of these the brothers of me the least,
15655 ^ to me you did [it].
15657 ^ then will he say also to those on [the] left,
15663 ^ depart from me,
15666 ^ those being cursed, into the fire - eternal,
15673 ^ - having been prepared for the devil and the angels of him.
15681 ^ i hungered for,
15683 ^ and nothing you gave to me
15687 ^ to eat;
15688 ^ i thirsted,
15689 ^ and nothing you gave to drink me;
15693 ^ a stranger i was,
15695 ^ and not you took in me;
15699 ^ naked,
15700 ^ and not you did clothe me;
15704 ^ sick and in prison,
15708 ^ and not did you visit me.
15712 ^ then will answer also themselves,
15716 ^ saying,
15717 ^ lord, when you saw we
15721 ^ hungering,
15722 ^ or thirsting, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison,
15733 ^ and not did minister to you?
15737 ^ then will he answer them,
15740 ^ saying,
15741 ^ truly i say to you,
15744 ^ to the extent that not you did [it] to one of these the least,
15752 ^ neither to me did you.
15755 ^ and will go away these into punishment eternal;
15761 ^ - but
15763 ^ the righteous into life eternal.
15767 ^ and it came to pass,
15769 ^ when had finished - jesus all the words these,
15777 ^ he said to the disciples of him,
15781 ^ you know
15782 ^ that after two days the passover takes place,
15789 ^ and the son - of man is delivered
15795 ^ over - to be crucified.
15798 ^ then were gathered together the chief priests and the elders of the people in the courtyard of the high priest,
15812 ^ who is called caiaphas,
15815 ^ and they plotted together,
15817 ^ in order that - jesus by guile they might seize
15822 ^ and kill.
15824 ^ they were saying however,
15826 ^ not during the feast,
15830 ^ that not a riot there be among the people.
15837 ^ - and
15839 ^ of jesus having been in bethany in [the] house of simon the leper,
15848 ^ came to him a woman,
15851 ^ having an alabaster flask fragrant oil very costly,
15855 ^ and poured [it] on the head of him
15861 ^ [as] he is reclining.
15862 ^ having seen then, the disciples became indignant,
15867 ^ saying,
15868 ^ for what purpose [is] the waste this?
15873 ^ could for
15875 ^ this have been sold for much,
15878 ^ and have been given to [the] poor.
15881 ^ having known [this] now, - jesus said to them,
15887 ^ why trouble do you cause to the woman?
15892 ^ a work for
15894 ^ beautiful she did to me.
15898 ^ always for the poor you have with you;
15905 ^ me however not always you have.
15910 ^ in pouring for this [woman] the fragrant oil this on the body of me,
15920 ^ for the burial of me she did [it].
15925 ^ truly i say to you,
15928 ^ wherever if shall be proclaimed the gospel this in all the world, will be spoken of also
15940 ^ that which did this [woman], for a memorial of her.
15946 ^ then
15947 ^ having gone one of the twelve,
15951 ^ the [one] being called judas iscariot,
15955 ^ to the chief priests, he said,
15959 ^ what are you willing me to give,
15963 ^ and i to you will betray him?
15967 ^ - and they appointed to him thirty pieces of silver.
15973 ^ and from that time, he was seeking an opportunity
15978 ^ that him he might betray.
15981 ^ on the now
15983 ^ first [day] of the unleavened [bread], came the disciples - to jesus,
15991 ^ saying,
15992 ^ where wish you [that]
15994 ^ we should prepare for you
15996 ^ to eat the passover?
15999 ^ - and he said,
16002 ^ go into the city unto a certain man
16009 ^ and tell him
16012 ^ the teacher says,
16015 ^ the time of me near is;
16020 ^ with you i will keep the passover, with the disciples of me.’
16029 ^ and did the disciples
16033 ^ as directed them - jesus,
16038 ^ and prepared the passover.
16042 ^ evening now having arrived,
16045 ^ he was reclining with the twelve.
16049 ^ and [as] they were eating, to them
16052 ^ he said,
16053 ^ truly i say to you
16056 ^ that one of you will betray me.
16062 ^ and
16063 ^ being grieved exceedingly, they began
16066 ^ to say to him, one each,
16070 ^ not i is it, lord?
16074 ^ - and
16076 ^ answering he said,
16078 ^ the [one] having dipped with me the hand in the dish,
16087 ^ he me will betray.
16090 ^ - indeed
16092 ^ the son - of man goes
16096 ^ as it has been written about him;
16100 ^ woe however - the man to that
16105 ^ by whom the son - of man is betrayed.
16112 ^ better would it be for him
16115 ^ if not had been born the man that.
16121 ^ answering now judas,
16124 ^ who was betraying him, said,
16128 ^ not i is it, rabbi?
16132 ^ he says to him,
16134 ^ you have said.
16136 ^ [as] they were eating now of them,
16139 ^ having taken - jesus
16142 ^ bread,
16143 ^ and having blessed, broke [it],
16146 ^ and
16147 ^ having given to the disciples, he said,
16151 ^ take,
16152 ^ eat;
16153 ^ this is the body of me.
16158 ^ and
16159 ^ having taken a cup
16161 ^ and having given thanks, he gave [it] to them,
16165 ^ saying,
16166 ^ drink of it, all of you.
16170 ^ this for is the blood of me, of the covenant,
16178 ^ - for many
16181 ^ being poured out for forgiveness of sins.
16185 ^ i say now to you,
16188 ^ no not will i drink, from now, of this the fruit of the vine, until the day that,
16203 ^ when it i drink with you anew in the kingdom of the father of me.
16215 ^ and
16216 ^ having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount - of olives.
16223 ^ then says to them - jesus,
16228 ^ all you will fall away because of me during the night this.
16237 ^ it has been written for:
16239 ^ i will strike the shepherd,
16242 ^ and will be scattered the sheep of the flock.’
16248 ^ after however - being raised, i will go before you into - galilee.
16258 ^ answering now, - peter said to him,
16264 ^ if all will fall away because of you,
16269 ^ i never will fall away.
16272 ^ said to him - jesus,
16276 ^ truly i say to you
16279 ^ that during this - night,
16284 ^ before [the] rooster
16286 ^ crowing, three times you will deny me.
16290 ^ says to him - peter,
16294 ^ even if it were necessary for
16296 ^ me with you to die,
16300 ^ no not you will i deny.
16304 ^ likewise also, all the disciples said.
16310 ^ then comes with them - jesus to a place
16318 ^ called gethsemane,
16320 ^ and he says to the disciples,
16324 ^ sit here,
16326 ^ until that
16328 ^ having gone away over there, i shall pray.
16331 ^ and
16332 ^ having taken with [him] - peter and the two sons of zebedee, he began
16341 ^ to be sorrowful
16342 ^ and deeply distressed.
16344 ^ then he says to them,
16347 ^ very sorrowful is the soul of me, even to death;
16354 ^ remain here
16356 ^ and watch with me.
16360 ^ and
16361 ^ having gone forward a little, he fell upon face of him,
16367 ^ praying,
16368 ^ and saying,
16370 ^ father of me, if possible it is,
16375 ^ let pass from me the cup this.
16381 ^ nevertheless not as i will,
16386 ^ but as you.
16389 ^ and he comes to the disciples
16394 ^ and finds them
16397 ^ sleeping.
16398 ^ and he says - to peter,
16402 ^ thus not were you able
16405 ^ one hour to watch with me?
16410 ^ watch
16411 ^ and pray,
16413 ^ that not you enter into temptation.
16418 ^ the indeed
16420 ^ spirit [is] willing,
16422 ^ - but
16424 ^ the flesh weak.
16426 ^ again
16427 ^ for a second time having gone away, he prayed,
16431 ^ saying,
16432 ^ father of me, if not is possible
16437 ^ this to pass
16439 ^ if not it i drink,
16443 ^ be done the will of you.
16447 ^ and
16448 ^ having come again, he finds them
16452 ^ sleeping,
16453 ^ were for of them the eyes
16458 ^ heavy.
16459 ^ and
16460 ^ having left them
16462 ^ again, having gone away, he prayed for [the] third time,
16467 ^ the same thing having said again.
16472 ^ then he comes to the disciples
16477 ^ and says to them,
16480 ^ sleep - later on
16483 ^ and take your rest.
16485 ^ behold,
16486 ^ has drawn near the hour,
16489 ^ and the son - of man is betrayed into [the] hands of sinners.
16498 ^ rise up,
16499 ^ let us go!
16500 ^ behold,
16501 ^ has drawn near
16502 ^ he who is betraying me!
16505 ^ and yet of him as he is speaking,
16509 ^ behold,
16510 ^ judas, one of the twelve, came,
16515 ^ and with him a crowd great, with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
16531 ^ the [one] then betraying him gave them a sign,
16538 ^ saying,
16539 ^ whomever - i shall kiss,
16542 ^ he it is;
16544 ^ seize him.
16546 ^ and immediately
16548 ^ having come up - to jesus, he said,
16552 ^ greetings, rabbi,
16554 ^ and kissed him.
16557 ^ - and
16559 ^ jesus said to him,
16562 ^ friend, for what are you come?”
16566 ^ then
16567 ^ having come to [him], they laid - hands on - jesus
16574 ^ and seized him.
16577 ^ and behold,
16579 ^ one of those with jesus,
16583 ^ having stretched out the hand, drew the sword of him,
16590 ^ and
16591 ^ having struck the servant of the high priest, cut off of him the ear.
16600 ^ then says to him - jesus,
16605 ^ return the sword of you into the place of it;
16613 ^ all for those having taken [the] sword, by [the] sword will perish.
16621 ^ or think you
16623 ^ that not i am able
16626 ^ to call upon the father of me,
16630 ^ and he will furnish to me presently more than twelve legions of angels?
16638 ^ how then should be fulfilled the scriptures,
16643 ^ that
16644 ^ so it must be?
16647 ^ in that - hour, said - jesus to the crowds,
16656 ^ as against a robber
16659 ^ did you come out with swords and clubs
16664 ^ to capture me?
16666 ^ every day in the temple i was sitting
16672 ^ teaching,
16673 ^ and not you did seize me.
16677 ^ this then
16679 ^ all is come to pass,
16681 ^ that might be fulfilled the scriptures of the prophets.
16687 ^ then the disciples all,
16691 ^ having forsaken him, fled.
16694 ^ those then
16696 ^ having seized - jesus led [him] away to caiaphas, the high priest,
16704 ^ where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
16711 ^ - and
16713 ^ peter was following him from afar, even to the court of the high priest.
16723 ^ and
16724 ^ having entered within, he was sitting with the guards
16730 ^ to see the outcome.
16733 ^ - and
16735 ^ the chief priests and the council whole were seeking false testimony against - jesus,
16745 ^ so that him they might put to death;
16748 ^ but not any they found,
16751 ^ of many having come forward as
16753 ^ false witnesses.
16754 ^ at last then,
16756 ^ having come forward two, they said,
16759 ^ this [man] has been saying,
16761 ^ i am able
16762 ^ to destroy the temple - of god,
16767 ^ and in three days to rebuild it.
16772 ^ and
16773 ^ having stood up, the high priest said to him,
16778 ^ nothing answer you?
16780 ^ what these you do witness against?
16784 ^ - and
16786 ^ jesus was silent.
16788 ^ and the high priest said to him,
16793 ^ i adjure you by - god
16798 ^ the living,
16800 ^ that us you tell
16803 ^ if you are the christ, the son - of god.
16812 ^ says to him - jesus,
16816 ^ you have said.
16818 ^ but i say to you,
16821 ^ from now you will see the son - of man
16828 ^ sitting at [the] right hand - of power
16833 ^ and coming upon the clouds - of heaven.”
16840 ^ then the high priest tears the garments of him,
16847 ^ saying,
16848 ^ he has blasphemed;
16849 ^ why any more need have we
16853 ^ of witnesses?
16854 ^ behold
16855 ^ now, you have heard the blasphemy.
16859 ^ what you do think?
16862 ^ - and
16864 ^ answering they said,
16866 ^ deserving of death he is.
16869 ^ then they spat in the face of him,
16875 ^ and struck him.
16878 ^ others then slapped [him],
16881 ^ saying,
16882 ^ prophesy to us, christ,
16885 ^ who is
16887 ^ the [one] having struck you?
16890 ^ - and
16892 ^ peter was sitting outside in the court,
16898 ^ and came to him one servant girl,
16903 ^ saying,
16904 ^ also you were with jesus the galilean.
16911 ^ - and he denied before all,
16916 ^ saying,
16917 ^ not i know
16919 ^ what you say.
16921 ^ having gone out then to the porch, saw him another [servant girl],
16929 ^ and says to those there,
16933 ^ this [man] was with jesus of nazareth.
16939 ^ and again he denied with an oath
16944 ^ -, not i know the man.
16949 ^ after a little while, also
16952 ^ having come to [him]
16953 ^ those standing by, they said - to peter,
16958 ^ surely also you of them are,
16964 ^ even for the speech of you away you gives.
16972 ^ then he began
16974 ^ to curse
16975 ^ and to swear
16977 ^ -, not i know the man!
16982 ^ and immediately a rooster crowed.
16986 ^ and remembered - peter the word of jesus,
16993 ^ he having said
16994 ^ -,
16995 ^ before [the] rooster
16997 ^ crowing, three times you will deny me.
17001 ^ and
17002 ^ having gone out, he wept bitterly.
17006 ^ morning then having arrived,
17009 ^ counsel took all the chief priests and the elders of the people against - jesus,
17022 ^ so that they might put to death him.
17025 ^ and
17026 ^ having bound him, they led away [him]
17029 ^ and delivered him to pilate, the governor.
17034 ^ then
17035 ^ having seen judas,
17037 ^ the [one] having delivered up him,
17040 ^ that he was condemned,
17042 ^ having regretted [it], he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
17051 ^ saying,
17052 ^ i sinned,
17053 ^ having betrayed blood innocent.
17056 ^ - then they said,
17059 ^ what [is that] to us?
17062 ^ you will see.
17064 ^ and
17065 ^ having cast down the pieces of silver into the temple, he withdrew,
17072 ^ and
17073 ^ having gone away, hanged himself.
17075 ^ - and
17077 ^ the chief priests,
17078 ^ having taken the pieces of silver, said,
17082 ^ not it is lawful
17084 ^ to put them into the treasury,
17089 ^ since [the] price of blood it is.
17093 ^ counsel then having taken, they bought with them the field of the potter, for a burial place for the strangers.
17107 ^ therefore was called the field that, field of blood, to - this day.
17117 ^ then was fulfilled
17119 ^ that having been spoken by jeremiah the prophet,
17125 ^ saying,
17126 ^ and they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price
17133 ^ of the [one] having been priced,
17135 ^ whom they set a price on by [the] sons of israel,
17140 ^ and they gave them for the field of the potter,
17148 ^ as directed me [the] lord.”
17152 ^ - and
17154 ^ jesus stood before the governor;
17159 ^ and questioned him the governor,
17164 ^ saying,
17165 ^ you are the king of the jews?
17171 ^ - and
17173 ^ jesus said,
17175 ^ you say.
17177 ^ and
17178 ^ in - being accused his by the chief priests and elders, nothing he answered.
17189 ^ then says to him - pilate,
17194 ^ not do you hear
17196 ^ how many things you they witness against?
17199 ^ and not he did answer him, to not even one word,
17207 ^ so as to amaze the governor exceedingly.
17212 ^ at now
17214 ^ [the] feast, was accustomed the governor
17218 ^ to release one to the multitude
17222 ^ prisoner,
17223 ^ whom they were wishing.
17225 ^ they were holding now at that time a prisoner notable,
17230 ^ called jesus barabbas.
17233 ^ being gathered together therefore of them,
17236 ^ said to them - pilate,
17240 ^ whom will you [that] i shall release to you?
17244 ^ jesus - barabbas,
17247 ^ or jesus,
17249 ^ who is called christ?
17252 ^ he knew for
17254 ^ that through envy they delivered up him.
17259 ^ as was sitting now he on the judgment seat,
17265 ^ sent to him the wife of him,
17271 ^ saying,
17272 ^ [let there be] nothing between you and the righteous [man] that;
17278 ^ many things for i suffered today in a dream because of him.
17286 ^ - and
17288 ^ the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds
17295 ^ that they should ask for - barabbas,
17299 ^ - and
17301 ^ jesus should destroy.
17303 ^ answering now, the governor said to them,
17309 ^ which do you desire of the two, i release to you?
17316 ^ - and they said,
17319 ^ - barabbas.
17321 ^ says to them - pilate,
17325 ^ what then should i do with jesus,
17329 ^ who is called christ?
17332 ^ they say all,
17334 ^ let [him] be crucified.
17335 ^ - and he said,
17338 ^ what for
17340 ^ evil did he commit?
17342 ^ - and all the more they kept crying out,
17346 ^ saying,
17347 ^ let [him] be crucified.
17348 ^ having seen now - pilate
17352 ^ that nothing it availed,
17355 ^ but rather a riot is arising,
17359 ^ having taken water, he washed the hands before the crowd,
17367 ^ saying,
17368 ^ guiltless i am of the blood of this.
17374 ^ for yourselves you will see.”
17376 ^ and
17377 ^ answering, all the people said,
17382 ^ the blood of him [be] on us, and on the children of us.
17392 ^ then he released to them - barabbas;
17397 ^ - and
17399 ^ jesus
17400 ^ having flogged, he delivered up [him],
17402 ^ that he might be crucified.
17404 ^ then the soldiers of the governor,
17409 ^ having taken with [them] - jesus to the praetorium, gathered before him all the cohort.
17421 ^ and
17422 ^ having stripped him, a robe scarlet they put around him.
17428 ^ and
17429 ^ having twisted together a crown of thorns, they put [it] on the head of him,
17438 ^ and a reed in the right hand of him;
17444 ^ and
17445 ^ having bowed the knees before him, they mocked him,
17450 ^ saying,
17451 ^ hail, king of the jews!
17455 ^ and
17456 ^ having spit upon him, they took the reed
17462 ^ and kept striking [him] on the head of him.
17468 ^ and when they had mocked him,
17472 ^ they took off him the robe,
17476 ^ and they put on him the garments of him
17482 ^ and led away him
17485 ^ to - crucify [him].
17488 ^ going forth now, they found a man of cyrene, named simon.
17495 ^ him they compelled
17497 ^ that he might carry the cross of him.
17502 ^ and
17503 ^ having come to a place
17506 ^ called golgotha,
17508 ^ which is
17510 ^ of a skull place called, they gave him
17515 ^ to drink wine
17517 ^ with gall mingled;
17520 ^ and
17521 ^ having tasted, not he was willing
17524 ^ to drink [it].
17525 ^ having crucified now him, they divided the garments of him,
17532 ^ casting lots.
17534 ^ and
17535 ^ sitting down, they were guarding him there.
17539 ^ and they put up over the head of him the accusation of him
17548 ^ written:
17549 ^ this is jesus, the king of the jews.
17556 ^ at the same time are crucified with him two robbers, one at [the] right hand, and one at [the] left.
17569 ^ those now passing by kept railing at him,
17574 ^ wagging the heads of them
17578 ^ and saying,
17580 ^ the [one] destroying the temple
17584 ^ and in three days building [it],
17589 ^ save yourself!
17591 ^ if [the] son you are
17594 ^ - of god,
17596 ^ also descend from the cross!
17601 ^ likewise also the chief priests,
17605 ^ mocking, with the scribes and elders, were saying,
17612 ^ others he saved.
17614 ^ himself not is he able to save.
17618 ^ king of israel he is.
17621 ^ let him descend now from the cross,
17626 ^ and we will believe in him.
17630 ^ he trusted on - god.
17634 ^ let him deliver now
17636 ^ if he wants him.
17639 ^ he said for
17641 ^ -, of god i am
17644 ^ [the] son.
17645 ^ - and
17647 ^ likewise even the robbers,
17651 ^ those having been crucified with him, were upbraiding him.
17657 ^ from then
17659 ^ [the] sixth hour, darkness was over all the land, until [the] hour ninth.
17670 ^ about then
17672 ^ the ninth hour, cried out - jesus in a voice loud,
17680 ^ saying,
17681 ^ eli, eli, lema sabachthani?
17685 ^ that is,
17687 ^ god of me, god of me, so that why me have you forsaken?”
17694 ^ some then
17696 ^ of those who there
17698 ^ were standing,
17699 ^ having heard, began saying
17701 ^ -, elijah calls this [man].
17705 ^ and immediately,
17707 ^ having run one of them
17711 ^ and having taken a sponge,
17714 ^ having filled [it] and with vinegar
17717 ^ and having put [it] on a reed, gave to drink him.
17722 ^ - and
17724 ^ the rest were saying,
17726 ^ let be.
17727 ^ let us see
17728 ^ whether comes elijah
17731 ^ to save him.
17733 ^ - and
17735 ^ jesus
17736 ^ again, having cried in a voice loud, yielded up [his] spirit.
17743 ^ and behold,
17745 ^ the veil of the temple was torn from top to bottom, into two;
17756 ^ and the earth was shaken,
17760 ^ and the rocks were split,
17764 ^ and the tombs were opened,
17768 ^ and many bodies of the
17772 ^ having fallen asleep saints arose,
17775 ^ and
17776 ^ having gone forth out of the tombs after the resurrection of him, they entered into the holy city
17789 ^ and appeared to many.
17792 ^ - and
17794 ^ the centurion and those with him
17799 ^ keeping guard over - jesus,
17802 ^ having seen the earthquake
17805 ^ and the things taking place, feared greatly,
17810 ^ saying,
17811 ^ truly god’s son was this.
17816 ^ they were now there women many
17821 ^ from afar off, looking on,
17824 ^ who followed - jesus from - galilee,
17831 ^ ministering to him,
17833 ^ among whom was mary - magdalene, and mary the - of james and joseph mother, and the mother of the sons of zebedee.
17853 ^ evening now having arrived,
17856 ^ came a man rich from arimathea,
17861 ^ named joseph,
17863 ^ who also
17865 ^ himself was discipled - to jesus.
17869 ^ he
17870 ^ having gone - to pilate, asked for the body - of jesus.
17878 ^ then - pilate commanded it
17882 ^ to be given up.
17883 ^ and
17884 ^ having taken the body, - joseph wrapped it in a linen cloth clean
17894 ^ and placed it in the new of him tomb,
17902 ^ which he had cut in the rock;
17907 ^ and
17908 ^ having rolled a stone great to the door of the tomb, he went away.
17916 ^ was now there mary - magdalene, and the other mary,
17926 ^ sitting opposite the tomb.
17930 ^ - and
17932 ^ the next day,
17933 ^ which is after the preparation, were gathered together the chief priests and the pharisees before pilate,
17946 ^ saying,
17947 ^ sir, we have remembered
17949 ^ how that - deceiver said
17954 ^ while living,
17956 ^ after three days i arise.
17960 ^ command therefore
17962 ^ to be secured the tomb until the third day,
17969 ^ lest ever
17970 ^ having come, the disciples of him steal away him
17976 ^ and say to the people,
17980 ^ he is risen from the dead.
17984 ^ and will be the last deception worse than the first.
17992 ^ said to them - pilate,
17996 ^ you have a guard.
17998 ^ go
17999 ^ make [it as] secure
18000 ^ as you know [how].
18002 ^ - and
18004 ^ having gone, they made secure the tomb,
18008 ^ having sealed the stone, with the guard.
18014 ^ after then
18016 ^ [the] sabbaths, it being dawn toward [the] first [day] of [the] week,
18022 ^ came mary - magdalene and the other mary,
18030 ^ to see the tomb.
18033 ^ and behold,
18035 ^ an earthquake there was
18037 ^ great;
18038 ^ an angel for
18040 ^ of [the] lord,
18041 ^ having descended out of heaven,
18044 ^ and having come, rolled away the stone
18049 ^ and was sitting upon it.
18053 ^ was now the appearance of him like lightning,
18060 ^ and the clothing of him white as snow.
18067 ^ from now
18069 ^ the fear of him trembled
18073 ^ those keeping guard
18075 ^ and became as dead [men].
18079 ^ answering now, the angel said to the women,
18086 ^ not fear you;
18089 ^ i know for
18091 ^ that jesus,
18093 ^ the [one] having been crucified, you seek.
18096 ^ not he is here;
18099 ^ he is risen for,
18101 ^ as he said.
18103 ^ come,
18104 ^ see the place
18107 ^ where he was lying.
18109 ^ and
18110 ^ quickly having gone, say to the disciples of him
18116 ^ that he is risen from the dead
18121 ^ and behold,
18123 ^ he goes before you into - galilee;
18128 ^ there him you will see.
18131 ^ behold,
18132 ^ i have told you.
18134 ^ and
18135 ^ having gone out quickly from the tomb with fear and joy great, they ran
18146 ^ to tell the disciples of him.
18150 ^ and behold,
18152 ^ jesus met them,
18155 ^ saying,
18156 ^ greetings!
18157 ^ - and
18159 ^ having come to [him], they took hold of his - feet
18164 ^ and worshiped him.
18167 ^ then says to them - jesus,
18172 ^ not fear.
18174 ^ go,
18175 ^ tell the brothers, of me
18179 ^ so that they should go into - galilee,
18184 ^ and there me will they see.
18187 ^ [as] were going now they,
18190 ^ behold,
18191 ^ some of the guard,
18194 ^ having gone into the city, reported to the chief priests
18201 ^ all the things having been done.
18204 ^ and
18205 ^ having been gathered together with the elders,
18209 ^ counsel then having taken, silver pieces many they gave to the soldiers,
18217 ^ saying,
18218 ^ say
18219 ^ that the disciples of him,
18223 ^ by night having come, stole him,
18227 ^ we being asleep.
18229 ^ and if is heard this by the governor,
18236 ^ we will persuade him,
18239 ^ and you out of trouble will keep.
18243 ^ - and
18245 ^ having taken the money, they did
18249 ^ as they were instructed.
18251 ^ and is spread abroad the report this among [the] jews, until the present day.
18262 ^ - and
18264 ^ the eleven disciples went into - galilee, to the mountain
18273 ^ where assigned them - jesus.
18278 ^ and
18279 ^ having seen him they worshiped;
18282 ^ some however doubted.
18285 ^ and
18286 ^ having come to [them], - jesus spoke to them,
18291 ^ saying,
18292 ^ has been given to me all authority in heaven and on the earth.
18302 ^ having gone therefore, disciple all the nations,
18308 ^ baptizing them in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy spirit,
18322 ^ teaching them
18324 ^ to observe all things,
18326 ^ whatever i commanded you.
18329 ^ and behold,
18331 ^ i with you am all the days, until the completion of the age.
18343 ^ [the] beginning of the gospel of jesus christ, son of god.
18350 ^ as it has been written in - isaiah the prophet:
18357 ^ behold,
18358 ^ i send the messenger of me before face of you,
18365 ^ who will prepare the way of you.”
18370 ^ [the] voice
18371 ^ of one crying in the wilderness,
18375 ^ prepare the way of [the] lord,
18379 ^ straight make the paths of him.’”
18384 ^ came john,
18386 ^ - baptizing in the wilderness
18391 ^ and proclaiming [a] baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.
18398 ^ and were going out to him all the of judea region, and - of jerusalem, all
18410 ^ and were being baptized by him in the jordan river,
18418 ^ confessing the sins of them.
18422 ^ and was - john
18426 ^ clothed in hair of a camel, and a belt of leather around the waist of him;
18436 ^ and he is eating locusts and honey wild.
18442 ^ and he was preaching,
18444 ^ saying,
18445 ^ he comes who [is] mightier than i after me,
18451 ^ of whom not i am sufficient,
18455 ^ having stooped down, to untie the strap of the sandals of him.
18462 ^ i baptized you with water;
18466 ^ he however will baptize you with [the] spirit holy.
18473 ^ and it came to pass in those - days,
18479 ^ [that] came jesus from nazareth - of galilee,
18485 ^ and was baptized in the jordan by john.
18492 ^ and
18493 ^ immediately going up from the water, he saw
18499 ^ tearing open the heavens, and the spirit
18505 ^ as a dove descending upon him.
18510 ^ and a voice came out of the heavens:
18516 ^ you are the son of me, the beloved,
18523 ^ in you i am well pleased.
18526 ^ and immediately the spirit him drives out into the wilderness.
18535 ^ and he was in the wilderness forty days,
18542 ^ being tempted by - satan.
18546 ^ and he was with the wild animals;
18551 ^ and the angels were ministering to him.
18556 ^ after and
18558 ^ the delivering up - of john, came - jesus into - galilee,
18568 ^ proclaiming the gospel - of god
18573 ^ and saying
18575 ^ -, has been fulfilled the time,
18579 ^ and has drawn near the kingdom - of god;
18585 ^ repent
18586 ^ and believe in the gospel.
18591 ^ and
18592 ^ passing by the sea - of galilee, he saw simon and andrew, the brother of simon,
18605 ^ casting a net into the sea;
18609 ^ they were for fishermen.
18612 ^ and said to them - jesus,
18617 ^ come after me,
18620 ^ and i will make
18622 ^ you to become fishers of men.
18626 ^ and immediately,
18628 ^ having left the nets, they followed him.
18633 ^ and
18634 ^ having gone on a little, he saw james the [son] - of zebedee, and john the brother of him, and they
18648 ^ [were] in the boat adjusting the nets.
18654 ^ and immediately he called them;
18658 ^ and
18659 ^ having left the father of them zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, they went away after him.
18673 ^ and they go into capernaum;
18677 ^ and immediately on the sabbaths,
18681 ^ having entered into the synagogue, he was teaching.
18686 ^ and they were astonished at the teaching of him;
18692 ^ he was for
18694 ^ teaching them
18696 ^ as authority having,
18699 ^ and not as the scribes.
18704 ^ and immediately there was in the synagogue of them a man with a spirit unclean,
18715 ^ and he cried out,
18717 ^ saying,
18718 ^ what to us and to you, jesus of nazareth?
18724 ^ did you come
18725 ^ to destroy us?
18727 ^ i know you
18729 ^ who are,
18731 ^ the holy [one] - of god!
18735 ^ and rebuked him - jesus,
18740 ^ saying
18741 ^ be silent,
18742 ^ and come forth out of him!
18746 ^ and
18747 ^ having thrown into convulsions him the spirit - unclean,
18753 ^ and having cried in a voice loud, it came forth out of him.
18760 ^ and were astonished all,
18763 ^ so as to question among themselves,
18767 ^ saying,
18768 ^ what is this
18771 ^ teaching new? with authority,
18775 ^ even the spirits - unclean he commands,
18781 ^ and they obey him!
18784 ^ and went out the news of him immediately, everywhere into all the surrounding region - of galilee.
18797 ^ and immediately,
18799 ^ out of the synagogue having gone forth, they came into the house of simon and andrew, with james and john.
18814 ^ - and
18816 ^ the mother-in-law of simon was laying sick
18819 ^ fevering.
18820 ^ and immediately they speak to him about her.
18826 ^ and
18827 ^ having come to [her], he raised up her,
18830 ^ having taken hold of the hand.
18833 ^ and left her the fever,
18838 ^ and she began to minister to them.
18841 ^ evening now having come,
18844 ^ when went down the sun,
18848 ^ they began bringing to him
18851 ^ all those sick
18854 ^ being,
18855 ^ and those being possessed by demons.
18858 ^ and was all the city
18863 ^ gathered together at the door.
18867 ^ and he healed many
18870 ^ sick being of various diseases,
18874 ^ and demons many he cast out.
18878 ^ and not he would allow
18881 ^ to speak the demons,
18884 ^ because they knew him.
18887 ^ and
18888 ^ very early, in night still much, having risen up, he went out
18893 ^ and departed into solitary a place,
18898 ^ and there he was praying.
18900 ^ and went after him simon and those with him,
18908 ^ and having found him,
18911 ^ also they say to him
18914 ^ -, everyone seeks you!
18918 ^ and he says to them,
18921 ^ let us go another way into the
18925 ^ neighboring towns,
18927 ^ so that also there i might preach;
18931 ^ for this therefore have i come forth.
18935 ^ and he was going,
18937 ^ preaching in the synagogues of them, in all - galilee,
18946 ^ and - demons casting out.
18950 ^ and comes to him a leper,
18955 ^ imploring him
18957 ^ and kneeling down to him,
18959 ^ and saying to him
18962 ^ -, if you are willing,
18965 ^ you are able
18966 ^ me to cleanse.
18968 ^ and
18969 ^ having been moved with compassion,
18970 ^ having stretched out the hand of him, he touched him
18975 ^ and says to him,
18978 ^ i am willing;
18979 ^ be you cleansed.
18980 ^ and immediately departed from him the leprosy,
18987 ^ and he was cleansed.
18989 ^ and
18990 ^ having sternly warned him, immediately he sent away him.
18995 ^ and he says to him,
18998 ^ see [that]
18999 ^ nothing to none you speak.
19002 ^ but go,
19004 ^ yourself show to the priest,
19008 ^ and offer for the cleansing of you
19014 ^ what commanded moses, for a testimony to them.
19020 ^ - and
19022 ^ having gone out, he began
19024 ^ to proclaim much
19026 ^ and to spread abroad the matter,
19030 ^ so that no longer he was able
19034 ^ openly into [the] city to enter;
19038 ^ but out in solitary places he was,
19044 ^ and they were coming to him from every quarter.
19049 ^ and
19050 ^ he having entered again into capernaum after [some] days, it was heard
19057 ^ that in [the] house he is.
19061 ^ and were gathered together many,
19064 ^ so that no more to have space, not even - at the door;
19072 ^ and he was speaking to them the word.
19077 ^ and they come,
19079 ^ bringing to him a paralytic,
19083 ^ being carried by four.
19086 ^ and
19087 ^ not being able
19089 ^ to come near to him on account of the crowd, they removed the roof
19097 ^ where he was,
19099 ^ and
19100 ^ having broken up [it], they let down the pallet
19104 ^ on which the paralytic was lying.
19108 ^ and
19109 ^ having seen - jesus the faith of them, he says to the paralytic,
19118 ^ son, are forgiven of you the sins.
19123 ^ were now some of the scribes
19128 ^ there sitting
19130 ^ and reasoning in the hearts of them,
19136 ^ why this [man] thus does speak?
19140 ^ he blasphemes!
19141 ^ who is able
19143 ^ to forgive sins,
19145 ^ if not alone - god?
19150 ^ and
19151 ^ immediately, having known - jesus in the spirit of him
19158 ^ that thus they are reasoning within themselves, he says to them,
19165 ^ why these things reason you in the hearts of you?
19172 ^ which is easier,
19175 ^ to say to the paralytic,
19178 ^ are forgiven of you the sins,
19182 ^ or to say,
19184 ^ arise,
19185 ^ and take up the mat of you,
19190 ^ and walk
19192 ^ that however you might know
19195 ^ that authority has the son - of man
19202 ^ to forgive sins on the earth...
19207 ^ he says to the paralytic,
19210 ^ to you i say,
19212 ^ arise,
19213 ^ take up the mat of you,
19217 ^ and go to the home of you.
19223 ^ and he arose
19225 ^ and immediately,
19227 ^ having taken up the mat, he went forth before all,
19233 ^ so as for to be amazed all,
19236 ^ and to glorify - god,
19240 ^ saying
19241 ^ -, thus never did we see.
19245 ^ and he went forth again beside the sea,
19251 ^ and all the crowd was coming to him,
19258 ^ and he taught them.
19261 ^ and
19262 ^ passing on, he saw levi the [son] - of alphaeus
19268 ^ sitting at the tax booth,
19272 ^ and he says to him,
19275 ^ follow me.
19277 ^ and
19278 ^ having arisen, he followed him.
19281 ^ and it came to pass,
19283 ^ reclining of him in the house of him,
19289 ^ that many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with - jesus and the disciples of him;
19301 ^ there were for many,
19304 ^ and they were following him.
19307 ^ and the scribes of the pharisees,
19312 ^ having seen
19313 ^ him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, were saying to the disciples of him,
19324 ^ why with the tax collectors and sinners does he eat?”
19331 ^ and
19332 ^ having heard, - jesus says to them
19337 ^ -, no need have
19341 ^ those being strong
19343 ^ of a physician,
19344 ^ but
19345 ^ those sick
19347 ^ being.
19348 ^ not i came
19350 ^ to call [the] righteous ,
19352 ^ but sinners.
19354 ^ and were the disciples of john and the pharisees
19362 ^ fasting.
19363 ^ and they come
19365 ^ and say to him,
19368 ^ because of why the disciples of john and the disciples of the pharisees fast,
19379 ^ - but
19381 ^ your disciples not fast?
19385 ^ and said to them - jesus,
19390 ^ not are able the sons of the bridechamber,
19396 ^ in which the bridegroom with them is,
19403 ^ to fast?
19404 ^ as long as time they have the bridegroom with them,
19411 ^ not they are able
19413 ^ to fast.
19414 ^ will come however [the] days
19417 ^ when will have been taken away from them the bridegroom,
19423 ^ and then they will fast in those the days.
19430 ^ no one a patch of cloth unshrunk sews on clothing old;
19438 ^ if now not
19441 ^ tears away the patch from it,
19446 ^ - new from the old,
19450 ^ and worse a tear takes place.
19454 ^ and no one puts wine new into wineskins old;
19462 ^ if now not,
19465 ^ will burst the wine the wineskins,
19470 ^ and the wine will be destroyed,
19474 ^ and the wineskins.
19477 ^ instead, wine new into wineskins new.”
19483 ^ and it came to pass,
19485 ^ he on the sabbaths is passing through the grainfields,
19493 ^ and the disciples of him began
19498 ^ [their] way to make,
19500 ^ plucking the heads of grain.
19503 ^ and the pharisees were saying to him,
19508 ^ behold,
19509 ^ why do they on the sabbaths
19513 ^ that which not is lawful?
19516 ^ and he said to them,
19519 ^ never did you read
19521 ^ what did david,
19524 ^ when need he had
19527 ^ and hungered, he and those with him?
19534 ^ how he entered into the house - of god in [the days of] abiathar the high priest,
19544 ^ and the loaves of the presentation ate,
19550 ^ which not it is lawful
19553 ^ to eat,
19554 ^ if not for the priests.
19558 ^ and he gave even
19561 ^ to those with him
19564 ^ being?
19565 ^ and he said to them,
19568 ^ the sabbath on account of the man was made,
19574 ^ and not the man on account of the sabbath.
19581 ^ so then, lord is the son - of man also even
19589 ^ of the sabbath.
19591 ^ and he entered again into the synagogue,
19597 ^ and there was there a man,
19601 ^ withered having
19603 ^ the hand,
19605 ^ and they were watching him,
19608 ^ whether on the sabbaths he will heal him,
19613 ^ in order that they might accuse him.
19616 ^ and he says to the man
19620 ^ - the withered,
19623 ^ hand
19624 ^ having
19625 ^ arise into the midst.
19629 ^ and he says to them,
19632 ^ is it lawful on the sabbaths
19635 ^ to do good,
19636 ^ or to do evil?
19638 ^ life to save,
19640 ^ or to kill?
19642 ^ - but they were silent.
19645 ^ and
19646 ^ having looked around on them with anger,
19650 ^ being grieved at the hardness of the heart of them, he says to the man,
19660 ^ stretch out the hand
19663 ^ and he stretched [it] out,
19665 ^ and was restored the hand of him.
19670 ^ and
19671 ^ having gone out, the pharisees immediately with the herodians counsel began to take against him,
19682 ^ how him they might destroy.
19685 ^ and - jesus, with the disciples of him, withdrew to the sea,
19696 ^ and great a multitude from - galilee followed,
19703 ^ and from - judea, and from jerusalem, and from - idumea, and beyond the jordan, and around tyre and sidon.
19723 ^ a multitude great,
19725 ^ having heard
19726 ^ how much he was doing, came to him.
19731 ^ and he spoke to the disciples of him
19736 ^ that a boat might wait upon him on account of the crowd,
19743 ^ that not they might press upon him.
19747 ^ many for he healed,
19750 ^ so as for to press upon him,
19753 ^ that him they might touch,
19756 ^ as many as had diseases.
19759 ^ and the spirits - unclean,
19764 ^ whenever him they beheld, were falling down before him
19769 ^ and crying out,
19771 ^ saying
19772 ^ -, you are the son - of god.
19779 ^ and much he would rebuke them,
19783 ^ so that not him known they should make.
19788 ^ and he goes up on the mountain
19793 ^ and calls near
19795 ^ those whom he wanted himself;
19798 ^ and they went to him.
19802 ^ and he appointed twelve
19805 ^ ones also apostles. he called [them]
19809 ^ that they might be with him,
19813 ^ and that he might send them
19817 ^ to preach,
19818 ^ and to have authority
19821 ^ to cast out - demons.
19824 ^ and he appointed the twelve.
19828 ^ and he added [the] name to simon,
19833 ^ peter;
19834 ^ and james the [son] of zebedee, and john the brother - of james,
19845 ^ and he added to them [the] name boanerges,
19850 ^ which is, sons of thunder;
19854 ^ and andrew, and philip, and bartholomew, and matthew, and thomas, and james the [son] - of alphaeus, and thaddaeus, and simon the zealot, and judas iscariot,
19878 ^ who also betrayed him.
19882 ^ and he comes to a house,
19886 ^ and comes together again a crowd,
19891 ^ so that not are they able them
19895 ^ even bread to eat.
19898 ^ and
19899 ^ having heard [of it], those belonging to him went out
19904 ^ to seize him;
19906 ^ they were saying for
19908 ^ -, he is out of his mind.
19910 ^ and the scribes,
19913 ^ those from jerusalem having come down, were saying
19918 ^ -, beelzebul he has,
19921 ^ and - by the prince of the demons he casts out the demons.
19931 ^ and
19932 ^ having called to [him] them, in parables he began speaking to them:
19938 ^ how is able satan,
19941 ^ satan to cast out?
19943 ^ and if a kingdom against itself is divided,
19949 ^ not is able
19951 ^ to stand the kingdom that.
19955 ^ and if a house against itself is divided,
19961 ^ not will be able the house that
19966 ^ to stand.
19967 ^ and if - satan has risen up against himself
19974 ^ and has been divided,
19976 ^ not he is able
19978 ^ to stand,
19979 ^ but an end is coming to.
19982 ^ but not is able no one,
19986 ^ into the house of the strong man having entered,
19992 ^ the goods of him to plunder,
19996 ^ if not first the strong man he binds.
20002 ^ and then the house of him he will plunder.
20008 ^ truly i say to you
20011 ^ that all will be forgiven the sons the of men,
20018 ^ the sins and the blasphemies,
20023 ^ as many as if they shall have blasphemed.
20026 ^ whoever however - shall blaspheme against the spirit - holy not has forgiveness to the age,
20041 ^ but guilty is
20044 ^ [of] eternal sin.
20046 ^ for they were saying,
20048 ^ a spirit unclean he has.
20051 ^ and arrive the mother of him and the brothers of him,
20060 ^ and
20061 ^ outside standing, sent to him,
20066 ^ calling him.
20068 ^ and was sitting around him a crowd.
20073 ^ and they said to him,
20076 ^ behold,
20077 ^ the mother of you and the brothers of you and the sisters of you outside are seeking you.
20091 ^ and
20092 ^ he answering them, says,
20095 ^ who are the mother of me and the brothers of me?
20104 ^ and
20105 ^ having looked around on
20106 ^ those who around him in a circle
20110 ^ were sitting, he says,
20112 ^ behold,
20113 ^ the mother of me, and the brothers of me!
20120 ^ whoever for - shall do the will - of god,
20128 ^ he brother of me, and sister, and mother is.
20136 ^ and again, he began
20139 ^ to teach beside the sea.
20143 ^ and was gathered together to him a crowd great,
20149 ^ so that he
20151 ^ into a boat having entered, sat in the sea,
20158 ^ and all the crowd close to the sea on the land was.
20169 ^ and he began teaching them in parables many things,
20175 ^ and he was saying to them in the teaching of him,
20182 ^ listen!
20183 ^ behold,
20184 ^ went out
20185 ^ the [one] sowing
20187 ^ to sow.
20188 ^ and it came to pass
20190 ^ as - he sowed,
20193 ^ some - fell along the road,
20199 ^ and came the birds
20203 ^ and devoured it.
20206 ^ and other fell upon the rocky place,
20212 ^ where not it had soil much,
20217 ^ and immediately it sprang up,
20220 ^ because of the not having depth of soil.
20226 ^ and after rose the sun,
20231 ^ it was scorched,
20232 ^ and
20233 ^ because of - not having root, it withered away.
20239 ^ and other fell among the thorns,
20245 ^ and grew up the thorns,
20249 ^ and choked it,
20252 ^ and fruit no it yielded.
20256 ^ and other fell into the soil - good,
20264 ^ and began yielding fruit,
20267 ^ growing up
20268 ^ and increasing,
20270 ^ and bearing one thirtyfold,
20274 ^ and one sixty,
20277 ^ and one a hundred.
20280 ^ and he was saying,
20282 ^ he who has ears
20285 ^ to hear, let him hear.
20287 ^ and when he was with alone,
20292 ^ began asking him those around him with the twelve about the parable.
20302 ^ and he was saying to them,
20305 ^ to you the mystery has been given
20309 ^ of the kingdom - of god.
20313 ^ to those however
20315 ^ who are outside, in parables - everything is done,
20322 ^ so that,
20323 ^ seeing, they might see
20325 ^ and not perceive;
20328 ^ and
20329 ^ hearing, they might hear
20331 ^ and not understand;
20334 ^ lest ever they should turn,
20336 ^ and should be forgiven them.’
20339 ^ and he says to them,
20342 ^ not understand you the parable this?
20347 ^ and how all the parables will you understand?
20353 ^ the [one] sowing, the word sows.
20358 ^ these now are they along the road,
20365 ^ where is sown the word,
20369 ^ and when they hear,
20372 ^ immediately comes - satan
20376 ^ and takes away the word
20380 ^ - having been sown in them.
20384 ^ and these are
20387 ^ those upon the rocky places
20391 ^ sown,
20392 ^ who,
20393 ^ when they hear the word, immediately with joy receive it,
20402 ^ and not they have root in themselves,
20408 ^ but temporary are;
20411 ^ then having arisen tribulation or persecution on account of the word,
20419 ^ immediately they fall away.
20421 ^ and these are
20424 ^ those among the thorns
20428 ^ sown.
20429 ^ these are
20431 ^ those, the word
20434 ^ having heard,
20435 ^ and the cares - of this age, and the deceit of the riches, and - of the other things desires
20451 ^ entering in, choke the word,
20455 ^ and unfruitful it becomes.
20458 ^ and these are
20461 ^ those upon the soil - good
20467 ^ having been sown;
20468 ^ such as hear the word
20472 ^ and receive [it],
20474 ^ and bring forth fruit,
20476 ^ one thirtyfold,
20478 ^ and one sixty,
20481 ^ and one a hundred.
20484 ^ and he was saying to them
20487 ^ not is brought in the lamp
20491 ^ so that under the basket it might be put,
20496 ^ or under the bed?
20500 ^ [is it] not that upon the lampstand it might be put?
20506 ^ nothing for there is hidden,
20510 ^ if not that it should be made manifest,
20514 ^ nor has taken place a secret thing,
20517 ^ but that it should come to light.
20522 ^ if anyone has ears
20526 ^ to hear,
20527 ^ let him hear.
20528 ^ and he was saying to them,
20531 ^ take heed
20532 ^ what you hear.
20534 ^ with what measure you measure
20538 ^ it will be measured to you,
20540 ^ and more will be added to you.
20543 ^ whoever for may have,
20546 ^ it will be given to him;
20548 ^ and he who not has,
20552 ^ even that which he has will be taken away from him.
20558 ^ and he was saying,
20560 ^ thus is the kingdom - of god,
20566 ^ as a man should cast the seed upon the earth,
20574 ^ and should sleep
20576 ^ and rise night and day,
20581 ^ and the seed should sprout
20585 ^ and grow;
20587 ^ how not knows he.
20591 ^ of itself, the earth brings forth fruit — first a plant, then an ear, then full grain in the ear.
20605 ^ when then offers itself the fruit,
20610 ^ immediately he sends the sickle,
20614 ^ for has come the harvest.
20618 ^ and he was saying,
20620 ^ to what shall we liken the kingdom - of god?
20626 ^ or in what it
20630 ^ parable shall we present?
20632 ^ as to a grain of mustard,
20635 ^ which,
20636 ^ when it has been sown upon the earth, smallest is
20643 ^ of all the seeds which [are] upon the earth,
20650 ^ and when it has been sown,
20653 ^ it grows up
20654 ^ and becomes greater than all the garden plants,
20660 ^ and it produces branches great,
20664 ^ so that are able
20666 ^ under the shadow of it the birds of the air to perch.
20675 ^ and with such parables many, he kept speaking to them the word,
20683 ^ as they were able
20685 ^ to hear.
20686 ^ without then
20688 ^ parables, not would he speak to them;
20692 ^ in private however, to his own disciples he would explain all things.
20700 ^ and he says to them on that - day,
20707 ^ evening having come,
20709 ^ let us pass over to the other side.
20713 ^ and
20714 ^ having dismissed the crowd, they take with [them] him
20719 ^ since he was in the boat;
20724 ^ also other boats were with him.
20730 ^ and comes a storm violent of wind,
20735 ^ and the waves were breaking over the boat,
20742 ^ so that already is being filled up the boat.
20747 ^ and he was in the stern,
20753 ^ on the cushion sleeping.
20757 ^ and they awaken him
20760 ^ and say to him,
20763 ^ teacher, not is it concern to you
20767 ^ that we perish?
20769 ^ and
20770 ^ having been awoken he rebuked the wind
20774 ^ and said to the sea,
20778 ^ silence,
20779 ^ be still.
20780 ^ and abated the wind,
20784 ^ and there was a calm great.
20788 ^ and he said to them,
20791 ^ why fearful are you?
20794 ^ still not have you faith?
20797 ^ and they feared [with] fear great,
20801 ^ and were saying to each other,
20805 ^ who then this is,
20809 ^ that even the wind and the sea obey him?
20818 ^ and they came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the gerasenes.
20830 ^ and having gone forth of him out of the boat,
20836 ^ immediately met him out of the tombs a man with a spirit unclean,
20846 ^ who the dwelling had in the tombs.
20853 ^ and not even with chains no longer anyone was able
20859 ^ him to bind,
20861 ^ because that he often with shackles and chains
20868 ^ had been bound,
20869 ^ and had been torn in two by him the chains,
20875 ^ and the shackles had been shattered,
20879 ^ and no one was able
20882 ^ him to subdue.
20884 ^ and constantly all night and day in the tombs and in the mountains he was
20898 ^ crying out
20899 ^ and cutting himself with stones.
20903 ^ and
20904 ^ having seen - jesus from afar, he ran
20910 ^ and fell on his knees before him.
20913 ^ and
20914 ^ having cried in a voice loud, he said,
20918 ^ what to me and to you, jesus, son - of god the most high?
20928 ^ i adjure you - by god,
20932 ^ not me torment.
20935 ^ he was saying for to him,
20938 ^ you come forth, the spirit - unclean, out of the man!
20946 ^ and he was asking him,
20949 ^ what [is] [the] name of you?
20952 ^ and saying, he answered,
20955 ^ legion [is] name to me,
20958 ^ because many we are.
20961 ^ and he begged him numerous times
20965 ^ that not them he would send out of the country.
20972 ^ there was now there, near the mountain, a herd of pigs great
20981 ^ feeding.
20982 ^ and they begged him,
20985 ^ saying,
20986 ^ send us into the pigs,
20991 ^ so that into them we may enter.
20995 ^ and he allowed them.
20998 ^ and
20999 ^ having gone out, the spirits - unclean entered into the pigs,
21008 ^ and rushed the herd down the steep bank into the sea, about two thousand,
21020 ^ and they were drowned in the sea.
21025 ^ and
21026 ^ those feeding them fled
21030 ^ and proclaimed [it] to the city and to the country.
21039 ^ and they went out
21041 ^ to see
21042 ^ what it is
21044 ^ that has been done.
21046 ^ and they come to - jesus
21051 ^ and see
21053 ^ the [man] possessed by demons
21055 ^ sitting,
21056 ^ clothed
21057 ^ and sound minded, the [one]
21060 ^ having had the legion;
21063 ^ and they were afraid.
21065 ^ and related to them
21068 ^ those having seen [it]
21070 ^ how it happened
21072 ^ to the [one] being possessed by demons, and concerning the pigs.
21078 ^ and they began
21080 ^ to implore
21081 ^ him to depart from the region of them.
21087 ^ and having entered he into the boat,
21093 ^ was begging him
21095 ^ the [one] having been possessed by demons,
21097 ^ that with him he might be.
21101 ^ and not he did permit him,
21105 ^ but he says to him,
21108 ^ go to the home of you, to - your own,
21116 ^ and report to them
21119 ^ how much the lord for you did
21124 ^ and had mercy on you.
21127 ^ and he departed
21129 ^ and began
21131 ^ to proclaim in the decapolis
21135 ^ how much had done for him - jesus;
21140 ^ and all were marveling.
21143 ^ and having passed over - jesus in the boat again to the other side,
21154 ^ was gathered a crowd great to him,
21159 ^ and he was beside the sea.
21164 ^ and comes one of the synagogue rulers, named jairus,
21171 ^ and
21172 ^ having seen him, falls at the feet of him
21179 ^ and he begs him much,
21183 ^ saying
21184 ^ -, the little daughter of me at the end is holding,
21190 ^ that,
21191 ^ having come, you would lay the hands on her,
21196 ^ so that she might be cured,
21198 ^ and she shall live.
21200 ^ and he departed with him.
21204 ^ and was following him a crowd great,
21209 ^ and pressing in on him.
21212 ^ and a woman,
21214 ^ being with a flux of blood twelve years,
21220 ^ and much having suffered under many physicians,
21226 ^ and having spent the of her all,
21232 ^ and in no way having benefited,
21235 ^ but rather to the worse having come,
21241 ^ having heard concerning - jesus,
21245 ^ having come up in the crowd behind, she touched the clothing of him.
21254 ^ she was saying for
21256 ^ -, if i shall touch even the garments of him,
21263 ^ i will be healed.
21264 ^ and immediately was dried up the flow of the blood of her,
21272 ^ and she knew in the body
21276 ^ that she was healed from the affliction.
21281 ^ and immediately - jesus,
21285 ^ having known in himself the out of him power having gone forth,
21293 ^ having turned in the crowd, said,
21298 ^ who of me touched
21301 ^ the garments?
21303 ^ and were saying to him the disciples of him,
21309 ^ you see the crowd
21312 ^ pressing in on you,
21314 ^ and say you,
21316 ^ who me touched?
21319 ^ and he was looking around
21321 ^ to see
21322 ^ the [one] this
21324 ^ having done.
21325 ^ - and
21327 ^ the woman,
21328 ^ having been frightened
21329 ^ and trembling,
21331 ^ knowing
21332 ^ what had been done to her, came
21336 ^ and fell down before him
21339 ^ and told him all the truth.
21345 ^ - and he said to her,
21349 ^ daughter, the faith of you has healed you;
21355 ^ go in peace
21358 ^ and be sound from the affliction of you.
21365 ^ [while] yet he is speaking,
21368 ^ they come from the ruler of synagogue’s [house],
21372 ^ saying
21373 ^ -, the daughter of you is dead;
21378 ^ why still trouble you the teacher?
21383 ^ - and
21385 ^ jesus,
21386 ^ having heard the word
21389 ^ spoken, says to the ruler of the synagogue,
21393 ^ not fear;
21395 ^ only believe.
21397 ^ and not he allowed no one
21401 ^ with him to follow,
21404 ^ if not - peter and james and john the brother of james.
21415 ^ and they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue,
21422 ^ and he beholds a commotion,
21425 ^ and weeping
21427 ^ and wailing much.
21430 ^ and
21431 ^ having entered, he says to them,
21434 ^ why make you commotion
21436 ^ and weep?
21438 ^ the child not is dead,
21442 ^ but sleeps.
21444 ^ and they were laughing at him.
21447 ^ he then,
21449 ^ having put out all, takes with [him] the father of the child, and the mother, and those with him,
21463 ^ and enters in
21465 ^ where was the child.
21469 ^ and
21470 ^ having taken the hand of the child, he says to her,
21477 ^ talitha, koum!
21479 ^ which is,
21481 ^ translated,
21482 ^ - little girl, to you i say,
21486 ^ arise!
21487 ^ and immediately arose the girl
21492 ^ and began walking;
21494 ^ she was for of years twelve.
21498 ^ and they were overcome immediately with amazement great.
21503 ^ and he instructed them strictly
21507 ^ that no one should know this;
21511 ^ and he commanded
21513 ^ to be given to her
21515 ^ to eat.
21516 ^ and he went out from there
21519 ^ and came into the hometown of him;
21525 ^ and follow him the disciples of him.
21531 ^ and having come [the] sabbath,
21534 ^ he began
21535 ^ to teach in the synagogue;
21539 ^ and many
21541 ^ hearing were astonished,
21543 ^ saying,
21544 ^ from where to this [man] these things,
21547 ^ and what [is] the wisdom
21551 ^ - having been given to him,
21554 ^ even the miracles, such
21558 ^ by the hands of him are done?
21563 ^ not this is the carpenter, the son - of mary, and brother of james and joseph and judas and simon?
21581 ^ and not are the sisters of him here with us?
21590 ^ and they took offense at him.
21594 ^ and said to them - jesus
21599 ^ -, not is a prophet without honor,
21604 ^ if not in the hometown of him, and among - relatives of him, and in the household of him.
21620 ^ and not he was able
21623 ^ there to do not any work of power,
21627 ^ if not
21629 ^ on a few sick, having laid the hands, he healed.
21635 ^ and he was amazed because of the unbelief of them.
21641 ^ and he was going the villages around,
21646 ^ teaching.
21647 ^ and he calls near the twelve,
21651 ^ and he began
21653 ^ them to send forth two [by] two,
21657 ^ and he gave to them authority over the spirits - unclean.
21665 ^ and he instructed them
21668 ^ that nothing they should take for [the] journey,
21673 ^ if not a staff only;
21677 ^ no bread,
21679 ^ nor bag,
21681 ^ nor in the belt money;
21686 ^ but
21687 ^ wearing sandals,
21689 ^ and not put on two tunics.
21694 ^ and he would say to them,
21697 ^ wherever if you enter into a house,
21702 ^ there remain
21704 ^ until - you go out from there.
21708 ^ and whatever - place not will receive you
21715 ^ nor hear you,
21718 ^ departing from there, shake off the dust which [is] under the feet of you, for a testimony against them.”
21731 ^ and
21732 ^ having gone out, they preached
21734 ^ that they should repent.
21736 ^ and demons many they were casting out,
21740 ^ and were anointing with oil many sick
21745 ^ and healing [them].
21747 ^ and heard - king herod;
21752 ^ well known for became the name of him.
21758 ^ and they were saying
21760 ^ -, john,
21762 ^ the [one] baptizing, is risen out from [the] dead,
21767 ^ and because of this operate the miraculous powers in him.
21775 ^ others however were saying
21778 ^ -, elijah he is.
21781 ^ others now were saying
21784 ^ -, a prophet, like one of the prophets.
21790 ^ having heard now, - herod was saying,
21795 ^ whom i beheaded, john —
21799 ^ he is risen!
21801 ^ himself for
21803 ^ - herod,
21805 ^ having sent, seized - john
21809 ^ and bound him in prison, on account of herodias, the wife of philip the brother of him,
21822 ^ because her he had married.
21825 ^ had been saying for - john - to herod
21831 ^ -, not it is lawful for you
21835 ^ to have the wife of the brother of you.
21841 ^ - and
21843 ^ herodias held it against him,
21846 ^ and wished
21848 ^ him to kill,
21850 ^ and not was able;
21853 ^ - for
21855 ^ herod was afraid of - john,
21859 ^ knowing him [to be] a man righteous and holy;
21865 ^ and he kept safe him.
21868 ^ and
21869 ^ having heard him, greatly he was perplexed
21873 ^ and gladly him heard.
21877 ^ and having come [a] day opportune,
21881 ^ when herod on the birthday of him a banquet made to the great men of him, and to the chief captains, and to the leading [men] - of galilee,
21899 ^ and having come in the daughter of him herodias,
21905 ^ and having danced,
21907 ^ pleased - herod
21910 ^ and those reclining with [him].
21913 ^ said the king to the girl,
21918 ^ ask me
21920 ^ whatever if you wish,
21923 ^ and i will give to you.
21926 ^ and he swore to her, whatever
21930 ^ that if me you might ask,
21934 ^ i will give you, up to half of the kingdom of me.
21941 ^ and
21942 ^ having gone out, she said to the mother of her,
21947 ^ what shall i ask?
21949 ^ - and she said,
21952 ^ the head of john
21955 ^ the [one] baptizing.
21957 ^ and
21958 ^ having entered immediately with haste to the king, she asked,
21966 ^ saying,
21967 ^ i desire
21968 ^ that at once you give to me upon a platter the head of john the baptist.
21979 ^ and
21980 ^ encompassingly sorrowful having been made the king, on account of the oaths and
21988 ^ those reclining with [him], not was he willing
21992 ^ to refuse her.
21994 ^ and immediately
21996 ^ having sent the king an executioner, he commanded
22001 ^ to be brought the head of him.
22005 ^ and
22006 ^ having gone, he beheaded him in the prison,
22012 ^ and brought the head of him upon a platter,
22019 ^ and gave it to the girl,
22024 ^ and the girl gave it to the mother of her.
22032 ^ and
22033 ^ having heard [it], the disciples of him came,
22038 ^ and took up the body of him,
22043 ^ and laid it in [a] tomb.
22048 ^ and are gathered together the apostles to - jesus,
22055 ^ and they related to him all things,
22059 ^ what they had done
22061 ^ and what they had taught.
22064 ^ and he said to them,
22067 ^ come you yourselves apart own to [a] solitary place,
22075 ^ and rest a little.
22078 ^ were for
22080 ^ those coming
22082 ^ and those going many,
22086 ^ and
22087 ^ not even to eat had they opportunity.
22090 ^ and they went away by the boat into [a] solitary place by themselves.
22100 ^ and they saw them
22103 ^ going,
22104 ^ and recognized many,
22107 ^ and on foot from all the cities ran together there,
22115 ^ and went before them.
22118 ^ and
22119 ^ having gone out, he saw a great crowd
22123 ^ and was moved with compassion toward them,
22127 ^ because they were like sheep
22131 ^ not having a shepherd.
22134 ^ and he began
22136 ^ to teach them many things.
22139 ^ and already the hour late being,
22144 ^ having come to him, the disciples of him were saying
22150 ^ -, desolate is the place,
22155 ^ and already [it is] an hour late.
22159 ^ dismiss them,
22161 ^ that
22162 ^ having gone to the surrounding region and villages, they might buy for themselves
22171 ^ something to eat.
22173 ^ - but
22175 ^ answering, he said to them,
22178 ^ give to them you
22181 ^ [something] to eat.
22182 ^ and they say to him,
22185 ^ having gone, shall we buy denarii two hundred of bread,
22190 ^ and give them
22193 ^ to eat?
22194 ^ - and he says to them,
22198 ^ how many loaves? have you
22201 ^ go,
22202 ^ see.
22203 ^ and
22204 ^ having known, they say,
22206 ^ five, and two fish.
22210 ^ and he commanded them
22213 ^ to make recline all, groups [by] groups on the green grass.
22221 ^ and they sat down groups [by] groups, by hundreds and by fifties.
22230 ^ and
22231 ^ having taken the five loaves and the two fish,
22239 ^ having looked up to the heaven, he blessed
22244 ^ and broke the loaves,
22248 ^ and he kept giving [them] to the disciples of him
22253 ^ that they might set before them.
22256 ^ and the two fish he divided among all.
22262 ^ and ate all
22265 ^ and were satisfied.
22267 ^ and they took up of fragments twelve hand-baskets full, and of the fish.
22277 ^ and were
22279 ^ those having eaten of the loaves five thousand men.
22285 ^ and immediately he compelled
22288 ^ the disciples of him to enter into the boat
22295 ^ and to go before to the other side, to bethsaida,
22302 ^ until he should dismiss the crowd.
22307 ^ and
22308 ^ having taken leave of them, he departed into the mountain
22314 ^ to pray.
22315 ^ and evening having come,
22318 ^ was the boat in the midst of the sea,
22325 ^ and he alone upon the land.
22331 ^ and
22332 ^ he having seen them
22334 ^ straining
22335 ^ in the rowing,
22338 ^ was for the wind contrary to them.
22344 ^ about [the] fourth watch of the night he comes to them,
22352 ^ walking on the sea,
22356 ^ and he was wishing
22358 ^ to pass by them.
22360 ^ - and
22362 ^ having seen him
22364 ^ on the sea walking, they thought
22369 ^ that a ghost [it] is,
22372 ^ and cried out.
22374 ^ all for him saw
22378 ^ and were troubled.
22380 ^ - and immediately he spoke with them,
22386 ^ and says to them,
22389 ^ take courage;
22390 ^ i am [he];
22392 ^ not fear.
22394 ^ and he went up to them into the boat,
22401 ^ and ceased the wind.
22405 ^ and exceedingly in abundance in themselves they were amazed,
22412 ^ not for they understood by the loaves;
22418 ^ but had been of them the heart
22423 ^ hardened.
22424 ^ and
22425 ^ having passed over to the land, they came to gennesaret
22432 ^ and drew to shore.
22434 ^ and on having come of them out of the boat,
22440 ^ immediately
22441 ^ having recognized him, they ran around all the country that,
22448 ^ and they began
22450 ^ on the mats
22453 ^ those sick
22455 ^ being to carry about,
22457 ^ to wherever they were hearing
22459 ^ that he is.
22461 ^ and wherever - he entered into villages or into cities or into fields,
22473 ^ in the marketplaces they were laying
22477 ^ the ailing,
22479 ^ and were begging him
22482 ^ that only the fringe the clothing of him they might touch;
22490 ^ and
22491 ^ as many as - touched him were being healed.
22496 ^ and are gathered together to him the pharisees and some of the scribes,
22506 ^ having come from jerusalem.
22509 ^ and they had seen some of the disciples of him
22515 ^ that with defiled hands,
22518 ^ that is unwashed, are eating the bread.
22524 ^ - for
22526 ^ the pharisees and all the jews,
22531 ^ if not carefully they wash the hands, not eat,
22539 ^ holding the tradition of the elders;
22544 ^ and [on coming] from the market,
22547 ^ if not they wash not they eat;
22552 ^ and other things many there are
22556 ^ which they received
22558 ^ [for them] to hold to —
22559 ^ washings of cups and vessels and utensils and couches for dining.
22567 ^ and questioned him the pharisees and the scribes,
22575 ^ because of why not walk the disciples of you according to the tradition of the elders,
22587 ^ but with unwashed hands eat the bread?
22593 ^ - and he said to them,
22597 ^ rightly prophesied isaiah concerning you - hypocrites,
22604 ^ as it has been written
22606 ^ -: this - people with the lips me honors,
22614 ^ - but
22616 ^ the heart of them far away is kept from me.
22622 ^ in vain now they worship me,
22626 ^ teaching [as] doctrines [the] precepts of men.’
22630 ^ having neglected the commandment - of god, you hold to the tradition - of men.”
22640 ^ and he was saying to them,
22643 ^ neatly do you set aside the commandment - of god,
22649 ^ that the tradition of you, you might keep.
22654 ^ moses for said,
22657 ^ honor the father of you and the mother of you,’
22665 ^ and,
22666 ^ the [one] speaking evil of father or mother, in death must end.’
22673 ^ you however say [that]
22676 ^ if says a man to the father or the mother,
22684 ^ [it is] corban,
22685 ^ that is, a gift,
22688 ^ whatever if from me you might be profited,
22693 ^ no longer do you allow him
22696 ^ anything to do for the father or the mother,
22703 ^ making void the word - of god for the tradition of you
22711 ^ which you have handed down.
22713 ^ and like [things] such many you do.
22718 ^ and
22719 ^ having called to [him] again the crowd, he was saying to them,
22725 ^ listen to me, all,
22728 ^ and understand:
22730 ^ nothing there is
22732 ^ from outside the man
22735 ^ entering into him,
22738 ^ which is able
22740 ^ to defile him;
22742 ^ but
22743 ^ the things out of the man
22747 ^ proceeding are
22749 ^ the things defiling the man.”
22753 ^ and when he went into [the] house from the crowd,
22761 ^ were asking him the disciples of him the parable.
22768 ^ and he says to them,
22771 ^ thus also you without understanding are?
22776 ^ not understand you
22778 ^ that
22779 ^ everything - from outside
22782 ^ entering into the man, not is able
22788 ^ him to defile,
22790 ^ because not it enters of him into the heart, but into the belly,
22801 ^ and into the sewer goes out?”
22806 ^ purifying all the food.
22810 ^ he was saying now
22812 ^ -,
22813 ^ that out of the man
22817 ^ going forth,
22818 ^ that defiles the man.
22822 ^ within for from the heart - of men - thoughts - evil go forth,
22834 ^ sexual immorality, thefts, murders, adulteries, covetous desires, wickednesses, deceit, sensuality, an eye evil, slander, pride, foolishness.
22847 ^ all these - evils from within go forth,
22853 ^ and they defile the man.
22857 ^ from there also
22859 ^ having risen up, he went away into the region of tyre.
22865 ^ and
22866 ^ having entered into a house, no one he was wishing
22871 ^ to know [it],
22872 ^ and not he was able
22875 ^ to be hidden.
22876 ^ but immediately
22878 ^ having heard a woman about him,
22882 ^ of whom had
22884 ^ the little daughter of her spirit unclean,
22889 ^ having come, fell at the feet of him.
22895 ^ - now
22897 ^ the woman was gentile, syrophoenician by race,
22903 ^ and kept asking him
22906 ^ that the demon he should cast forth out of the daughter of her.
22914 ^ and he was saying to her,
22917 ^ permit first
22919 ^ to be satisfied the children;
22922 ^ not for it is good
22926 ^ to take the bread of the children,
22931 ^ and to the dogs to cast [it].
22935 ^ - but she answered
22938 ^ and says to him,
22941 ^ lord; even the dogs under the table eat of the crumbs of the children.
22954 ^ and he said to her,
22957 ^ because of this - word, go;
22962 ^ has gone forth out of the daughter of you the demon.
22969 ^ and
22970 ^ having gone away to the home of her, she found the child
22978 ^ lying on the bed, and the demon
22985 ^ having gone out.
22986 ^ and again
22988 ^ having departed from the region of tyre, he came through sidon, to the sea - of galilee through [the] midst of the region of [the] decapolis.
23006 ^ and they bring to him a deaf man and who spoke with difficulty,
23012 ^ and they implore him
23015 ^ that he might lay on him the hand.
23020 ^ and
23021 ^ having taken away him from the crowd aside privately, he put the fingers of him to the ears of him,
23036 ^ and
23037 ^ having spit, he touched the tongue of him,
23042 ^ and
23043 ^ having looked up to - heaven he sighed deeply,
23048 ^ and he says to him,
23051 ^ ephphatha!
23052 ^ that is, be opened!”
23055 ^ and immediately were opened his - ears,
23061 ^ and was loosed the band of the tongue of him,
23068 ^ and he began speaking plainly.
23071 ^ and he instructed them
23074 ^ that no one they should tell.
23077 ^ as much as however he kept instructing
23081 ^ them, more abundantly they were proclaiming [it].
23085 ^ and above measure they were astonished,
23088 ^ saying,
23089 ^ well all things he has done;
23092 ^ both
23093 ^ the deaf he makes
23096 ^ to hear,
23097 ^ and the mute to speak.
23101 ^ in those - days, again great [the] crowd being
23109 ^ and not having
23112 ^ what they might eat,
23114 ^ having called to [him] the disciples, he says to them,
23119 ^ i am moved with compassion upon the crowd,
23123 ^ because already days three they continue with me,
23129 ^ and nothing have
23132 ^ that they might eat.
23134 ^ and if i shall send away them hungry to [the] homes of them,
23142 ^ they will faint on the way.
23146 ^ for some of them from afar are come.
23152 ^ and answered him the disciples of him
23158 ^ -,
23159 ^ from where these will be able anyone here to satisfy with bread in this desolate place?
23168 ^ and he was asking them,
23171 ^ how many have you
23173 ^ loaves?
23174 ^ - and they said,
23177 ^ seven.
23178 ^ and he directs the crowd
23182 ^ to recline on the ground.
23186 ^ and
23187 ^ having taken the seven loaves,
23191 ^ having given thanks, he broke [them]
23193 ^ and kept giving [them] to disciples of him,
23198 ^ that they might set before [them].
23200 ^ and they set [it] before the crowd.
23204 ^ and they had small fish a few.
23208 ^ and
23209 ^ having blessed them, he ordered
23212 ^ also these to be set before [them].
23215 ^ and they ate
23217 ^ and were satisfied.
23219 ^ and they took up over and above of fragments seven baskets.
23225 ^ there were now about four thousand.
23229 ^ and he sent away them.
23232 ^ and immediately
23234 ^ having entered into the boat with the disciples of him, he came into the district of dalmanutha.
23247 ^ and went out the pharisees
23251 ^ and began
23253 ^ to dispute with him,
23255 ^ seeking from him a sign from - heaven,
23262 ^ testing him.
23264 ^ and
23265 ^ having sighed deeply in the spirit of him, he says,
23270 ^ why the generation this seeks a sign?
23276 ^ truly i say to you,
23279 ^ if there will be given to the generation this a sign.
23285 ^ and
23286 ^ having left them,
23288 ^ again having embarked, he went away to the other side.
23294 ^ and they forgot
23296 ^ to take loaves,
23298 ^ and if not one loaf
23303 ^ not they had with them in the boat.
23310 ^ and he was instructing them,
23313 ^ saying,
23314 ^ watch out;
23315 ^ take heed of the leaven of the pharisees, and of the leaven of herod.
23325 ^ and they were reasoning with one another
23329 ^ because loaves not they have.
23333 ^ and
23334 ^ having known [it], he says to them,
23337 ^ why reason you
23339 ^ because loaves not you have?
23343 ^ not yet do you perceive
23345 ^ nor understand?
23347 ^ hardened do you have
23349 ^ the heart of you?
23352 ^ eyes having, not do you see?
23356 ^ and
23357 ^ ears having, not do you hear?
23361 ^ and not do you remember?
23364 ^ when the five loaves i broke for the five thousand,
23372 ^ how many hand-baskets of fragments full took you up?
23377 ^ they say to him,
23379 ^ twelve.
23380 ^ when the seven to the four thousand,
23386 ^ of how many baskets [the] fillings
23389 ^ of fragments took you up?
23391 ^ and said they,
23394 ^ seven.
23395 ^ and he was saying to them,
23398 ^ not yet do you understand?
23400 ^ and they come to bethsaida.
23404 ^ and they bring to him a blind [man],
23408 ^ and implore him
23411 ^ that him he might touch.
23414 ^ and
23415 ^ having taken hold of the hand of the blind [man], he led forth him out of the village,
23425 ^ and
23426 ^ having spit upon the eyes of him,
23431 ^ having laid the hands upon him, he was asking him
23437 ^ if anything you see.
23440 ^ and
23441 ^ having looked up he was saying,
23443 ^ i see the men,
23446 ^ for
23447 ^ as trees i see [them] walking.
23451 ^ then again he laid the hands upon the eyes of him,
23460 ^ and he opened his eyes
23462 ^ and he was restored,
23464 ^ and he began to see clearly everything.
23468 ^ and he sent him to [the] home of him,
23474 ^ saying,
23475 ^ not into the village may you enter.”
23480 ^ and went forth - jesus and the disciples of him into the villages of caesarea - philippi.
23494 ^ and on the way, he was questioning the disciples of him,
23502 ^ saying to them,
23504 ^ whom me do pronounce - men to be?
23510 ^ - and they answered him,
23514 ^ saying
23515 ^ -, john the baptist;
23519 ^ and others,
23521 ^ elijah;
23522 ^ others now
23524 ^ -, one of the prophets.
23528 ^ and he was questioning them,
23532 ^ you however,
23534 ^ whom me do pronounce to be?
23538 ^ answering, - peter says to him,
23543 ^ you are the christ.
23547 ^ and he warned them
23550 ^ that no one they should tell concerning him.
23555 ^ and he began
23557 ^ to teach them
23559 ^ that it is necessary for
23561 ^ the son - of man many things to suffer,
23567 ^ and to be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes,
23578 ^ and to be killed,
23580 ^ and after three days to rise [again].
23585 ^ and openly the word he was speaking.
23590 ^ and
23591 ^ having taken him - peter to him, he began
23596 ^ to rebuke him.
23598 ^ - and
23600 ^ having turned
23601 ^ and having looked upon the disciples of him, he rebuked peter
23608 ^ and said,
23610 ^ get behind me, satan,
23614 ^ for not you have in mind the things of god,
23620 ^ but the things of men.
23624 ^ and
23625 ^ having called to [him] the crowd with the disciples of him, he said to them,
23634 ^ if anyone desires
23637 ^ after me to follow,
23640 ^ let him deny himself,
23642 ^ and let him take up the cross of him,
23647 ^ and let him follow me.
23650 ^ whoever for if might desire
23654 ^ - life his to save, will lose it;
23660 ^ whoever now - will lose the life of him on account of me and of the gospel, he will save it.
23674 ^ what for does it profit
23677 ^ a man to gain the world whole
23682 ^ and to lose the soul of him?
23687 ^ what for shall give a man [as] an exchange for the soul of him?
23695 ^ whoever for if may be ashamed of me and - my words in the generation this - adulterous and sinful,
23712 ^ also the son - of man will be ashamed of him
23719 ^ when he shall come in the glory of the father of him, with the angels - holy.
23732 ^ and he was saying to them,
23735 ^ truly i say to you
23738 ^ that there are some
23741 ^ here of those standing,
23744 ^ who no not shall taste of death,
23749 ^ until - they see the kingdom - of god
23756 ^ having come with power.
23759 ^ and after days six takes along - jesus, - peter and - james and - john,
23774 ^ and brings up them into a mountain high apart themselves alone.
23783 ^ and he was transfigured before them,
23787 ^ and the garments of him became
23792 ^ shining white exceedingly,
23795 ^ such as a launderer on the earth not is able
23802 ^ thus to whiten.
23804 ^ and appeared to them elijah with moses,
23810 ^ and they were
23812 ^ talking with - jesus.
23815 ^ and
23816 ^ answering, - peter says - to jesus,
23822 ^ rabbi, good it is
23825 ^ for us here to be.
23828 ^ and let us make three tabernacles: for you one, and for moses one, and for elijah one.
23840 ^ not for he knew
23843 ^ what he should say;
23845 ^ terrified for they were.
23848 ^ and there came a cloud
23851 ^ overshadowing them,
23853 ^ and there came a voice out of the cloud:
23859 ^ this is the son of me, the beloved;
23866 ^ listen you to him.
23868 ^ and suddenly,
23870 ^ having looked around, no longer no one they saw
23874 ^ except - jesus alone with them.
23880 ^ and descending of them from the mountain,
23886 ^ he instructed them
23888 ^ that to no one
23890 ^ what they had seen they should tell,
23893 ^ if not until the son - of man out from [the] dead had risen.
23903 ^ and that saying they kept among themselves,
23909 ^ questioning
23910 ^ what it is
23912 ^ - out from the dead
23915 ^ to rise.
23916 ^ and they were asking him,
23919 ^ saying
23920 ^ -, say the scribes
23924 ^ that
23925 ^ elijah it behooves to come first?
23929 ^ - and he was saying to them,
23933 ^ elijah indeed
23935 ^ having come first, restores all things;
23939 ^ and how has it been written of the son - of man,
23947 ^ that many things he should suffer
23950 ^ and be set at naught?
23952 ^ but i say to you,
23955 ^ that also elijah has come,
23959 ^ and they did to him
23962 ^ whatever they desired,
23964 ^ as it has been written of him.
23968 ^ and
23969 ^ having come to the disciples, they saw a crowd great around them, and scribes
23980 ^ arguing with them.
23983 ^ and immediately all the crowd,
23988 ^ having seen him, were greatly amazed,
23991 ^ and
23992 ^ running to [him], were greeting him.
23995 ^ and he asked them,
23998 ^ what are you disputing with them?
24002 ^ and answered him one out of the crowd,
24009 ^ teacher, i brought the son of me to you,
24016 ^ having a spirit mute;
24019 ^ and whenever if him it seizes,
24024 ^ it throws down him;
24026 ^ and he foams,
24028 ^ and gnashes - his teeth,
24032 ^ and is withering away.
24034 ^ and i spoke to the disciples of you,
24039 ^ that it they might cast out,
24042 ^ and not they had power.
24045 ^ - and
24047 ^ answering him, he says,
24050 ^ o generation unbelieving! until when with you will i be?
24058 ^ until when will i bear with you?
24062 ^ bring him to me.
24066 ^ and they brought him to him.
24071 ^ and
24072 ^ having seen him, the spirit immediately threw into convulsions him,
24079 ^ and
24080 ^ having fallen upon the ground, he began rolling around,
24085 ^ foaming.
24086 ^ and he asked the father of him,
24091 ^ how long a time is it
24094 ^ that this has been with him?
24098 ^ - and he said,
24101 ^ from childhood.
24103 ^ and often both into fire him it casts,
24110 ^ and into waters,
24113 ^ that it might destroy him.
24116 ^ but if anything you are able [to do],
24120 ^ help us,
24122 ^ having compassion on us.
24125 ^ - and
24127 ^ jesus said to him,
24130 ^ -
24131 ^ if you are able?
24133 ^ all things are possible
24135 ^ to the [one] believing.
24137 ^ immediately
24138 ^ having cried out, the father of the child was saying,
24144 ^ i believe;
24145 ^ help of me the unbelief!
24149 ^ having seen now - jesus
24153 ^ that was running together a crowd, he rebuked the spirit - unclean,
24161 ^ saying to it,
24163 ^ - mute and deaf spirit, i command you,
24171 ^ come out of him,
24174 ^ and no more may you enter into him.
24179 ^ and
24180 ^ having cried out,
24181 ^ and much having thrown him into convulsions, it came out;
24185 ^ and he became as if dead,
24189 ^ in order for - many to say
24193 ^ that he was dead.
24195 ^ - and
24197 ^ jesus,
24198 ^ having taken by the hand him, raised up him,
24204 ^ and he arose.
24206 ^ and having entered he into a house,
24211 ^ the disciples of him in private were asking him,
24218 ^ why we not were able
24222 ^ to cast out it?
24224 ^ and he said to them,
24227 ^ this - kind by nothing is able
24233 ^ to go out,
24234 ^ if not by prayer.”
24238 ^ from there
24239 ^ having gone forth, they were passing through - galilee;
24244 ^ and not did he want
24247 ^ that anyone should know [it];
24250 ^ he was teaching for the disciples of him,
24255 ^ and he was saying to them
24258 ^ -, the son - of man is delivered into [the] hands of men,
24267 ^ and they will kill him;
24270 ^ and
24271 ^ having been killed, on the third day he will arise.
24276 ^ - and they did not understand the saying,
24281 ^ and they were afraid
24283 ^ him to ask.
24285 ^ and they came to capernaum.
24289 ^ and
24290 ^ in the house having been, he was asking them,
24296 ^ what on the way were you discussing?
24301 ^ - and they were silent,
24304 ^ with one another for they had been discussing along the road
24311 ^ which [was] greatest.
24313 ^ and
24314 ^ having sat down, he called the twelve,
24318 ^ and he says to them,
24321 ^ if anyone desires
24324 ^ first to be,
24326 ^ he will be of all last and of all servant.
24332 ^ and
24333 ^ having taken a child, he set it in midst of them;
24340 ^ and
24341 ^ having taken in [his] arms it, he said to them,
24345 ^ whoever - one - of such little children shall receive in the name of me, me receives;
24358 ^ and
24359 ^ whoever - me shall receive, not me receives,
24366 ^ but
24367 ^ the [one] having sent me.
24370 ^ answered him - john,
24374 ^ teacher, we saw someone
24377 ^ in the name of you casting out demons,
24383 ^ and we were forbidding him,
24386 ^ because not he was following us.
24390 ^ - and
24392 ^ jesus said,
24394 ^ not forbid him.
24397 ^ no one for there is
24400 ^ who will do a work of power in the name of me,
24407 ^ and will be able
24409 ^ readily to speak evil of me.
24412 ^ whoever for not is against us, for us is.
24421 ^ whoever for - might give to drink you a cup of water, in name
24430 ^ because christ’s you are,
24433 ^ truly i say to you,
24436 ^ that no not shall he lose the reward of him.
24443 ^ and whoever - might cause to stumble one of the little ones these
24451 ^ - believing in me,
24455 ^ better it is for him rather
24459 ^ if is put a millstone heavy around the neck of him
24467 ^ and he has been cast into the sea.
24472 ^ and if should cause to stumble you the hand of you,
24479 ^ cut off it;
24481 ^ better it is
24483 ^ for you crippled to enter into - life,
24489 ^ than
24490 ^ - two hands having, to go away into - hell, into the fire - unquenchable.
24503 ^ and if the foot of you should cause to stumble you,
24510 ^ cut off it;
24512 ^ better it is
24514 ^ for you to enter into - life lame,
24520 ^ than
24521 ^ the two feet having, to be cast into - hell.
24529 ^ and if the eye of you should cause to stumble you,
24536 ^ cast out it;
24538 ^ better
24539 ^ for you it is with one eye to enter into the kingdom - of god,
24548 ^ than
24549 ^ two eyes having to be cast into - hell,
24556 ^ where the worm of them not dies,
24562 ^ and the fire not is quenched.’
24567 ^ everyone for with fire will be salted.
24571 ^ good [is] the salt;
24574 ^ if however the salt unsalty becomes,
24580 ^ with what it will you season?
24584 ^ have in yourselves salt,
24588 ^ and be at peace with one another.
24592 ^ and
24593 ^ from there having risen up, he comes into the region - of judea, and beyond the jordan.
24605 ^ and come together again crowds to him,
24611 ^ and as he had been accustomed,
24614 ^ again he was teaching them.
24617 ^ and
24618 ^ having come to [him], the pharisees were demanding of him
24622 ^ if it is lawful for a husband
24625 ^ a wife to divorce,
24627 ^ testing him.
24629 ^ - and
24631 ^ he answering, said to them,
24634 ^ what you did command moses?
24638 ^ - and they said,
24641 ^ permitted moses
24643 ^ a roll of divorce to write,
24646 ^ and to send [her] away.
24648 ^ - but
24650 ^ jesus said to them,
24653 ^ because of the hardness of heart of you, he wrote for you the commandment this.
24662 ^ from, however,
24664 ^ [the] beginning of creation, male and female he made them.’
24671 ^ on account of this, will leave a man the father of him and - mother
24681 ^ and be joined to - wife his,
24687 ^ and will be the two for flesh one.’
24694 ^ therefore no longer they are two,
24698 ^ but one flesh.
24701 ^ what therefore - god has joined together, man not let separate.
24709 ^ and in the house again, the disciples concerning this were asking him.
24720 ^ and he says to them,
24723 ^ whoever - shall divorce the wife of him,
24729 ^ and shall marry another, commits adultery against her.
24735 ^ and if a woman,
24738 ^ having divorced the husband of her, should marry another,
24744 ^ she commits adultery.
24745 ^ and they were bringing to him little children,
24749 ^ that them he might touch.
24752 ^ - but
24754 ^ the disciples rebuked them.
24757 ^ having seen now, - jesus was indignant
24762 ^ and said to them,
24765 ^ permit the little children
24768 ^ to come to me;
24771 ^ not do hinder them!
24774 ^ to the for
24776 ^ such, belongs the kingdom - of god.
24782 ^ truly i say to you,
24785 ^ whoever - not shall receive the kingdom - of god as a child, no not shall enter into it.
24800 ^ and
24801 ^ having taken [them] in arms, them he was blessing,
24804 ^ having laid the hands on them.
24809 ^ and going forth of him on [the] journey,
24814 ^ having run up one
24816 ^ and having knelt down to him, was asking him,
24821 ^ teacher good, what shall i do,
24825 ^ that life eternal i might inherit?
24829 ^ - and
24831 ^ jesus said to him,
24834 ^ why me call you good?
24838 ^ no one [is] good,
24840 ^ if not alone - god.
24845 ^ the commandments you know:
24848 ^ not shall you murder,
24850 ^ not shall you commit adultery,
24852 ^ not shall you steal,
24854 ^ not shall you bear false witness,
24856 ^ not shall you defraud,
24858 ^ you shall honor the father of you and the mother.’
24865 ^ - and he was saying to him,
24869 ^ teacher, these all i have kept from [the] youth of me.
24876 ^ - and
24878 ^ jesus,
24879 ^ having looked upon him, loved him
24883 ^ and said to him,
24886 ^ one thing to you is lacking.
24889 ^ go,
24890 ^ as much as you have sell,
24893 ^ and give to the poor,
24897 ^ and you will have treasure in heaven;
24902 ^ and come, follow me.
24906 ^ - and
24908 ^ having been sad at the word, he went away
24913 ^ grieving;
24914 ^ he was [one] for
24916 ^ having possessions many.
24919 ^ and
24920 ^ having looked around, - jesus says the disciples of him,
24927 ^ how difficultly
24929 ^ those - riches
24932 ^ having, into the kingdom - of god will enter!
24939 ^ - and
24941 ^ the disciples were astonished at the words of him.
24947 ^ - but
24949 ^ jesus,
24950 ^ again answering, says to them,
24954 ^ children, how difficult it is
24958 ^ into the kingdom - of god to enter!
24964 ^ easier it is
24966 ^ [for] a camel through the eye of the needle to pass,
24973 ^ than [for] a rich man into the kingdom - of god to enter.
24981 ^ - and exceedingly they were astonished,
24985 ^ saying among themselves,
24988 ^ then who is able
24991 ^ to be saved?
24992 ^ having looked on them, - jesus says,
24997 ^ with men [it is] impossible,
25000 ^ but not with god;
25004 ^ all things for [are] possible with - god.
25010 ^ began
25011 ^ to say - peter to him,
25015 ^ behold,
25016 ^ we have left all
25019 ^ and followed you.
25022 ^ was saying - jesus,
25025 ^ truly i say to you,
25028 ^ no one there is
25030 ^ who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for the sake of me and because of the gospel,
25051 ^ if not shall take a hundredfold now in the time this — houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions —
25073 ^ and in the age
25077 ^ which is coming, life eternal.
25081 ^ many however will be
25084 ^ first, last;
25086 ^ and the last, first.
25090 ^ they were then on the way,
25095 ^ going up to jerusalem,
25098 ^ and was
25100 ^ going on before them - jesus,
25104 ^ and they were astonished;
25106 ^ those then
25108 ^ following were afraid.
25110 ^ and
25111 ^ having taken to [him] again the twelve, he began
25116 ^ them to tell
25118 ^ the things being about
25120 ^ to him to happen:
25122 ^ - behold,
25124 ^ we go up to jerusalem,
25127 ^ and the son - of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes,
25138 ^ and they will condemn him to death,
25142 ^ and will betray him to the gentiles.
25147 ^ and they will mock him,
25150 ^ and will spit upon him,
25153 ^ and will flog him,
25156 ^ and will kill,
25158 ^ and on the third day he will rise again.
25163 ^ and come up to him james and john, the sons of zebedee,
25172 ^ saying to him,
25174 ^ teacher, we desire
25176 ^ that
25177 ^ whatever if we might ask you, you would do for us.
25183 ^ - and he said to them,
25187 ^ what do you desire me to do for you?
25192 ^ - and they said to him,
25196 ^ grant to us
25198 ^ that one of [us] at [your] right hand, and one at [your] left hand, we might sit in the glory of you.
25212 ^ - and
25214 ^ jesus said to them,
25217 ^ not you know
25219 ^ what you ask.
25221 ^ are you able
25222 ^ to drink the cup
25225 ^ which i drink,
25228 ^ and the baptism
25231 ^ which i am baptized , to be baptized [with]?
25235 ^ - and they said to him,
25239 ^ we are able.
25240 ^ - and
25242 ^ jesus said to them,
25245 ^ the cup
25247 ^ which i drink, you will drink;
25251 ^ and the baptism
25254 ^ which i am baptized , you will be baptized [with];
25258 ^ - but
25260 ^ to sit at [the] right hand of me or at [the] left hand, not is
25269 ^ mine to give,
25271 ^ but [to those]
25272 ^ for whom it has been prepared.
25274 ^ and
25275 ^ having heard [this], the ten began
25279 ^ to be indignant about james and john.
25284 ^ and
25285 ^ having called near them, - jesus says to them,
25291 ^ you know
25292 ^ that
25293 ^ those being accounted
25295 ^ to rule over the gentiles exercise lordship over them;
25300 ^ and those great ones of them exercise authority over them.
25306 ^ not thus however shall it be among you.
25312 ^ instead,
25313 ^ whoever - desires
25316 ^ great to become among you, will be your servant;
25323 ^ and
25324 ^ whoever - desires
25327 ^ among you to become first, will be of all slave.
25334 ^ even for the son - of man not came
25342 ^ to be served,
25343 ^ but to serve,
25345 ^ and to give the life of him [as] a ransom for many.
25353 ^ and they come to jericho.
25357 ^ and as was going out he from jericho —
25362 ^ and the disciples of him, and a crowd large —
25369 ^ the son of timaeus, bartimaeus, blind beggar, was sitting beside the road.
25379 ^ and
25380 ^ having heard
25381 ^ that jesus of nazareth it is, he began
25387 ^ to cry out
25388 ^ and to say,
25390 ^ son of david, jesus, have mercy on me.
25395 ^ and were rebuking him many
25399 ^ that he should be silent;
25401 ^ - but much more he kept crying out,
25406 ^ son of david, have mercy on me.
25410 ^ and
25411 ^ having stopped, - jesus commanded
25415 ^ to be called him.
25417 ^ and they call the blind [man],
25421 ^ saying to him,
25423 ^ take courage!
25424 ^ rise up!
25425 ^ he calls you.
25427 ^ - and
25429 ^ having cast away the cloak of him,
25433 ^ having risen up, he came to - jesus.
25438 ^ and
25439 ^ answering him, - jesus says,
25444 ^ what to you do you desire i should do?
25448 ^ - and
25450 ^ the blind [man] said to him,
25453 ^ rabboni, that i may receive sight.
25456 ^ and - jesus said to him,
25461 ^ go,
25462 ^ the faith of you has healed you.
25467 ^ and immediately he received sight,
25470 ^ and he began following him on the way.
25476 ^ and when they drew near to jerusalem, to bethphage and bethany, near the mount - of olives,
25490 ^ he sends two of the disciples of him
25495 ^ and says to them,
25498 ^ go into the village, - before you,
25505 ^ and immediately,
25507 ^ entering into it, you will find a colt
25512 ^ having been tied,
25513 ^ upon which no one not yet
25517 ^ of men has sat;
25519 ^ having untied it,
25521 ^ also bring [it].
25523 ^ and if anyone to you says,
25528 ^ why are you doing this?’
25531 ^ say,
25532 ^ the lord of it need has,
25537 ^ and soon it he will send back here.
25543 ^ and they departed
25545 ^ and found the colt
25548 ^ having been tied at the door outside, by the street,
25555 ^ and they untied it.
25558 ^ and some
25560 ^ of those there
25562 ^ standing were saying to them,
25565 ^ what are you doing
25567 ^ untying the colt?
25570 ^ - and they spoke to them
25574 ^ as had commanded - jesus,
25578 ^ and they allowed them.
25581 ^ and they led the colt to - jesus,
25588 ^ and they cast upon it the cloaks of them,
25594 ^ and he sat on it.
25598 ^ and many the cloaks of them spread on the road;
25607 ^ others then, branches
25610 ^ having been cut down from the fields.
25614 ^ and
25615 ^ those going before
25617 ^ and those following were crying out:
25621 ^ hosanna!”
25622 ^ blessed is
25623 ^ the [one] coming in [the] name of [the] lord!”
25628 ^ blessed [is] the
25630 ^ coming kingdom of the father of us, david!
25636 ^ hosanna in the highest!”
25640 ^ and he entered into jerusalem, into the temple,
25647 ^ and
25648 ^ having looked around on all things,
25650 ^ late already being the hour, he went out to bethany with the twelve.
25661 ^ and on the next day, having gone out they from bethany,
25668 ^ he was hungry.
25669 ^ and
25670 ^ having seen a fig tree from afar,
25674 ^ having leaves, he went
25677 ^ if perhaps anything he will find on it.
25683 ^ and
25684 ^ having come to it, nothing he found,
25689 ^ if not leaves;
25692 ^ the for
25694 ^ season not it was of figs.
25698 ^ and
25699 ^ answering, he said to it,
25702 ^ no more to the age, of you no one fruit may eat.
25711 ^ and were listening the disciples of him.
25716 ^ and they come to jerusalem.
25720 ^ and
25721 ^ having entered into the temple, he began
25726 ^ to cast out
25727 ^ those selling
25729 ^ and those buying in the temple;
25735 ^ and the tables of the money changers and the seats
25743 ^ of those selling the doves he overturned.
25748 ^ and not he would permit
25751 ^ that anyone should carry a vessel through the temple.
25758 ^ and he began teaching,
25760 ^ and was saying to them,
25763 ^ not has it been written
25765 ^ -: the house of me a house of prayer will be called for all the nations’
25775 ^ you however have made it a den of robbers.’
25781 ^ and heard [it] the chief priests and the scribes,
25788 ^ and they were seeking
25790 ^ how him they might destroy;
25793 ^ they were afraid of for him;
25796 ^ all for
25798 ^ the crowd was astonished at the teaching of him.
25805 ^ and when evening came,
25809 ^ they were going forth out of the city.
25813 ^ and
25814 ^ passing by in the morning, they saw the fig tree
25819 ^ having been dried up from [the] roots.
25822 ^ and
25823 ^ having remembered, - peter says to him,
25828 ^ rabbi, look,
25830 ^ the fig tree
25832 ^ that you cursed is dried up.
25835 ^ and
25836 ^ answering, - jesus says to them,
25841 ^ have faith from god.
25844 ^ truly i say to you
25847 ^ that whoever - shall say to the mountain this,
25854 ^ be you taken away
25855 ^ and be you cast into the sea,’
25860 ^ and not shall doubt in the heart of him,
25867 ^ but shall believe
25869 ^ that
25870 ^ what he says takes place,
25873 ^ it will be done for him.
25875 ^ because of this i say to you,
25879 ^ all things whatever praying,
25882 ^ also you ask, believe
25885 ^ that you receive,
25887 ^ and it will be to you.
25890 ^ and when you may stand
25893 ^ praying,
25894 ^ forgive
25895 ^ if anything you have against anyone,
25900 ^ so that also the father of you, who [is] in the heavens, might forgive you the trespasses of you.”
25914 ^ and they come again to jerusalem.
25919 ^ and in the temple is walking as he,
25925 ^ come to him the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
25936 ^ and they were saying to him,
25939 ^ by what authority these things are you doing?
25944 ^ or, who you gave the authority this,
25951 ^ that these things you should do?
25954 ^ - and
25956 ^ jesus said to them,
25959 ^ i will ask you one question,
25963 ^ and you answer me,
25966 ^ and i will tell you
25969 ^ by what authority these things i do.
25974 ^ the baptism - of john,
25978 ^ from heaven was it,
25981 ^ or from men?
25984 ^ answer me.
25986 ^ and they began reasoning with themselves,
25990 ^ saying,
25991 ^ if we should say, from heaven,
25995 ^ he will say,
25996 ^ because of why then not did you believe him?
26002 ^ but should we say, from men’...
26006 ^ they were afraid of the people;
26009 ^ all for were holding - john
26014 ^ truly that a prophet he was.
26018 ^ and
26019 ^ answering - to jesus, they say,
26023 ^ not do we know.
26025 ^ and - jesus says to them,
26030 ^ neither i tell you
26034 ^ by what authority these things i do.
26039 ^ and he began
26041 ^ to them in parables to speak:
26045 ^ a vineyard a man planted,
26048 ^ and he placed around [it] a fence,
26051 ^ and dug a wine vat,
26054 ^ and built a tower,
26057 ^ and rented out it to farmers,
26061 ^ and traveled abroad.
26063 ^ and he sent to the farmers at the due time a servant,
26071 ^ that from the farmers he might receive from the fruit of the vineyard.
26081 ^ but
26082 ^ having taken him, they beat [him]
26085 ^ and sent [him] away empty-handed.
26088 ^ and again he sent to them another servant,
26095 ^ and him they struck on the head
26097 ^ and treated shamefully.
26099 ^ and another he sent,
26102 ^ and him they killed;
26104 ^ also many others,
26107 ^ some indeed beating,
26110 ^ some then killing.
26113 ^ yet one having
26116 ^ son beloved,
26118 ^ he sent him last to them,
26123 ^ saying
26124 ^ -, they will have respect for the son of me.
26129 ^ those however
26131 ^ - farmers to themselves said
26136 ^ -, this is the heir;
26141 ^ come,
26142 ^ let us kill him,
26144 ^ and ours will be the inheritance.
26149 ^ and
26150 ^ having taken, they killed him
26153 ^ and cast forth him outside the vineyard.
26159 ^ what therefore will do the master of the vineyard?
26166 ^ he will come
26167 ^ and will destroy the farmers,
26171 ^ and will give the vineyard to others.
26176 ^ not even the scripture this have you read:
26181 ^ [the] stone
26182 ^ which rejected
26184 ^ those building,
26186 ^ this has become the chief corner;
26191 ^ from [the] lord was this,
26195 ^ and it is marvelous in [the] eyes of us.’
26201 ^ and they were seeking
26203 ^ him to lay hold of,
26205 ^ and they feared the crowd;
26209 ^ they knew for
26211 ^ that against them the parable he had spoken.
26217 ^ and
26218 ^ having left him, they went away.
26221 ^ and they send to him some of the pharisees, and of the herodians,
26231 ^ that him they might catch in discourse.
26235 ^ and
26236 ^ having come, they say to him,
26239 ^ teacher, we know
26241 ^ that true you are,
26244 ^ and not there is care to you about no one;
26250 ^ not for you look on [the] appearance of men,
26256 ^ but on the basis of [the] truth the way - of god teach.
26264 ^ is it lawful
26265 ^ to give tribute to caesar
26268 ^ or not?
26270 ^ should we pay
26271 ^ or not pay?
26274 ^ - and
26276 ^ knowing of them the hypocrisy, he said to them,
26282 ^ why me do you test?
26285 ^ bring me a denarius,
26288 ^ that i might see [it].
26290 ^ - and they brought [it].
26293 ^ and he says to them,
26296 ^ whose [is] the likeness this, and the inscription?
26303 ^ - and they said to him,
26307 ^ caesar’s.
26308 ^ - and
26310 ^ jesus said to them,
26313 ^ the things of caesar, give back to caesar,
26317 ^ and the things - of god, - to god.
26323 ^ and they were amazed at him.
26327 ^ and come sadducees to him,
26332 ^ who say
26334 ^ a resurrection not there is,
26337 ^ and they began questioning him,
26340 ^ saying,
26341 ^ teacher, moses wrote for us
26345 ^ that if of anyone a brother should die,
26350 ^ and leave behind a wife,
26353 ^ and not leave children,
26357 ^ that should take the brother of him the wife,
26364 ^ and raise up seed for the brother of him.
26370 ^ seven brothers there were;
26373 ^ and the first took a wife,
26378 ^ and,
26379 ^ dying, not left seed.
26383 ^ and the second took her,
26388 ^ and died,
26390 ^ not having left seed;
26393 ^ and the third likewise.
26397 ^ and the seven not left seed.
26403 ^ last of all also, the woman died.
26409 ^ in the resurrection,
26412 ^ when they rise, of which of them will she be
26417 ^ wife?
26418 ^ - for
26420 ^ the seven had her as wife.
26424 ^ was saying to them - jesus,
26428 ^ not because of this do you err,
26432 ^ not knowing the scriptures,
26436 ^ nor the power - of god?
26441 ^ when for out from [the] dead they rise,
26446 ^ neither do they marry,
26448 ^ nor are given in marriage;
26450 ^ but are like angels in the heavens.
26457 ^ concerning now
26459 ^ the dead,
26461 ^ that they rise, not have you read in the book of moses, on the bush,
26472 ^ how spoke to him - god,
26477 ^ saying,
26478 ^ i [am] the god of abraham, and the god of isaac, and the god of jacob’
26490 ^ not he is god of [the] dead,
26494 ^ but
26495 ^ of [the] living.
26496 ^ greatly you err.
26498 ^ and
26499 ^ having come up one of the scribes,
26503 ^ having heard them
26505 ^ reasoning together,
26506 ^ having seen
26507 ^ that well he answered them, he questioned him,
26513 ^ which is
26515 ^ commandment [the] first of all?
26518 ^ answered - jesus,
26521 ^ the foremost is,
26524 ^ hear this o israel:
26526 ^ [the] lord - god of us, [the] lord one is,
26533 ^ and you shall love [the] lord - god of you with all the heart of you, and with all the soul of you, and with all the mind of you, and with all the strength of you.’
26562 ^ [the] second this:
26564 ^ you shall love the neighbor of you as yourself.’
26570 ^ greater than these another commandment not there is.
26576 ^ and said to him the scribe,
26581 ^ right, teacher,
26583 ^ according to truth you have spoken
26586 ^ that one he is,
26589 ^ and not there is another besides him,
26595 ^ and
26596 ^ - to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength,
26613 ^ and - to love the neighbor as oneself more important is
26622 ^ than all the burnt offerings and sacrifices.
26627 ^ and - jesus,
26630 ^ having seen him
26632 ^ that wisely he answered, said to him,
26637 ^ not far are you from the kingdom - of god.
26645 ^ and no one no longer dared
26649 ^ him to question.
26651 ^ and
26652 ^ answering, - jesus was saying,
26656 ^ teaching in the temple,
26660 ^ how say the scribes
26664 ^ that the christ, [the] son of david is?
26670 ^ himself david said by the spirit - holy:
26678 ^ said [the] lord to the lord of me,
26683 ^ sit at [the] right hand of me,
26687 ^ until - i place of the enemies of you [as] a footstool of the feet of you.”’
26697 ^ himself david calls him lord,
26702 ^ then how of him is he
26706 ^ son?
26707 ^ and the great crowd was listening to him gladly.
26714 ^ and in the teaching of him, he was saying,
26720 ^ beware of the scribes,
26724 ^ - desiring
26726 ^ in robes to walk about, and greetings in the marketplaces, and first seats in the synagogues, and first places at the feasts;
26744 ^ those devouring the houses of the widows,
26750 ^ and as a pretext, at great length praying.
26754 ^ these will receive greater judgment.
26758 ^ and
26759 ^ having sat down opposite the treasury, he was watching
26764 ^ how the crowd cast money into the treasury;
26772 ^ and many rich were casting [in] much.
26777 ^ and
26778 ^ having come, one widow poor cast [in] lepta two,
26785 ^ which is a kodrantes.
26788 ^ and
26789 ^ having called to [him] the disciples of him, he says to them,
26795 ^ truly i say to you
26798 ^ that the widow this - poor, more
26805 ^ than all has cast [in]
26807 ^ of those casting into the treasury.
26812 ^ all for
26814 ^ out of that which was abounding to them cast [in];
26819 ^ she however, out of the poverty of her,
26825 ^ all as much as she had cast [in],
26829 ^ all the livelihood of her.
26833 ^ and going forth of him out of the temple,
26839 ^ says to him one of the disciples of him,
26845 ^ teacher, behold
26847 ^ what stones and what buildings!
26852 ^ and - jesus said to him,
26857 ^ see you these - great buildings?
26862 ^ no not shall be left here stone upon stone,
26869 ^ which no not shall be thrown down.
26873 ^ and sitting of him upon the mount - of olives, opposite the temple,
26884 ^ asked him in private peter and james and john and andrew,
26895 ^ tell us
26897 ^ when these things will be?
26900 ^ and what [will be] the sign
26904 ^ when are going these things
26907 ^ to be accomplished
26908 ^ all?
26909 ^ - and
26911 ^ jesus began
26913 ^ to say to them,
26915 ^ take heed,
26916 ^ lest anyone you mislead.
26920 ^ many will come in the name of me,
26926 ^ saying
26927 ^ -, i am [he],
26930 ^ and many they will mislead.
26933 ^ when then you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars,
26940 ^ not be disturbed;
26942 ^ it must
26943 ^ come to pass,
26944 ^ but not yet [is] the end.
26948 ^ will rise up for nation against nation,
26953 ^ and kingdom against kingdom.
26957 ^ there will be earthquakes throughout places;
26961 ^ there will be famines.
26963 ^ [the] beginning of birth pains [are] these.
26966 ^ take heed however you to yourselves;
26970 ^ they will betray you to courts
26974 ^ and in synagogues; you will be beaten,
26978 ^ and before governors and kings you will stand because of me, for a testimony to them.
26989 ^ and
26990 ^ to all the nations first it behooves to proclaim the gospel.
26999 ^ and when they might lead away you,
27003 ^ delivering [you] up,
27004 ^ not be anxious beforehand
27006 ^ what you should say,
27008 ^ but whatever if might be given to you, in that - hour,
27017 ^ that speak;
27019 ^ not for are you
27023 ^ those speaking,
27025 ^ but the spirit - holy.
27030 ^ and will deliver up brother, brother to death,
27036 ^ and father, child;
27039 ^ and will rise up children against parents,
27044 ^ and will put to death them.
27047 ^ and you will be
27049 ^ hated by all on account of the name of me;
27056 ^ the [one] however
27058 ^ having endured to [the] end,
27061 ^ he will be saved.
27063 ^ when then you see the abomination of the desolation
27070 ^ standing
27071 ^ where not it should —
27074 ^ the [one] reading, let him understand —
27077 ^ then those in - judea, let them flee to the mountains,
27086 ^ the [one] and
27088 ^ upon the housetop, not let him come down,
27093 ^ nor go in
27095 ^ to take anything out of the house of him;
27101 ^ and the [one] in the field, not let him return to the things behind,
27111 ^ to take the clothing of him.
27115 ^ woe then
27117 ^ to those in womb
27120 ^ having,
27121 ^ and to the [ones] nursing infants in those - days!
27128 ^ pray then
27130 ^ that it not might be in winter;
27134 ^ will be [in] for the days those tribulation,
27140 ^ such as never has been the like, from [the] beginning of creation,
27147 ^ which created - god, until - now —
27154 ^ and never not shall be.
27158 ^ and if not had shortened [the] lord the days,
27165 ^ no - there would have been saved any flesh;
27170 ^ but on account of the elect
27174 ^ whom he chose, he has shortened the days.
27179 ^ and then if anyone to you says,
27185 ^ behold,
27186 ^ here [is] the christ!
27189 ^ behold,
27190 ^ there!
27191 ^ not you shall believe [it].
27193 ^ there will arise for false christs and false prophets,
27198 ^ and will give signs and wonders,
27203 ^ so as - to deceive
27206 ^ if possible, the elect.
27210 ^ you however take heed;
27213 ^ i have foretold to you all things.
27216 ^ but in those - days, after the tribulation those, the sun will be darkened,
27228 ^ and the moon not will give the light of it;
27236 ^ and the stars will be
27240 ^ out of the heaven falling,
27244 ^ and the powers that [are] in the heavens will be shaken.’
27252 ^ and then will they see the son - of man
27259 ^ coming in [the] clouds, with power great and glory.
27267 ^ and then he will send the angels,
27272 ^ and will gather together the elect of him, from the four winds, from [the] end of earth to [the] end of heaven.
27287 ^ of now
27289 ^ the fig tree, learn the parable:
27294 ^ when already the branch of it tender has become,
27301 ^ and it puts forth the leaves,
27305 ^ you know
27306 ^ that near the summer is.
27311 ^ so also you,
27314 ^ when you see these things
27317 ^ coming to pass, know
27319 ^ that near he is, at [the] doors.
27324 ^ truly i say to you
27327 ^ that no not will have passed away the generation this
27334 ^ until that these things all shall have taken place.
27339 ^ the heaven and the earth will pass away,
27345 ^ - but
27347 ^ the words of me in no way not will pass away.
27352 ^ concerning now
27354 ^ the day that, or the hour, no one knows;
27362 ^ not even the angels in heaven,
27367 ^ nor the son,
27370 ^ if not the father.
27374 ^ take heed;
27375 ^ watch;
27376 ^ not you know for
27379 ^ when the time is.
27383 ^ [it is] like a man going on a journey,
27386 ^ having left the house of him,
27390 ^ and having given the servants of him - authority,
27397 ^ to each one the work of him.
27401 ^ and the doorkeeper he commanded
27405 ^ that he should keep watch.
27407 ^ watch therefore —
27409 ^ not you know for
27412 ^ when the master of the house comes,
27418 ^ or at evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or morning —
27426 ^ lest
27427 ^ having come suddenly, he should find you
27431 ^ sleeping.
27432 ^ what now to you i say, to all i say:
27438 ^ watch!
27439 ^ it would be now the passover and the [feast of] unleavened bread, after two days.
27449 ^ and were seeking the chief priests and the scribes
27456 ^ how,
27457 ^ him by stealth having taken, they might kill [him].
27462 ^ they were saying for,
27464 ^ not during the feast,
27468 ^ lest ever there will be an uproar of the people.
27473 ^ and being of him in bethany in the house of simon the leper,
27484 ^ having reclined of him,
27486 ^ came a woman
27488 ^ having an alabaster flask of fragrant oil of nard pure of great price;
27494 ^ having broken the alabaster flask, she poured [it] on his - head.
27501 ^ were now some
27504 ^ indignant within themselves:
27507 ^ to what the waste this of the fragrant oil has been made?
27515 ^ could for this - fragrant oil
27520 ^ to have been sold for above denarii three hundred,
27524 ^ and to have been given to the poor.
27528 ^ and they were grumbling at her.
27531 ^ - and
27533 ^ jesus said,
27535 ^ leave alone her;
27537 ^ why to her trouble do you cause?
27541 ^ a good work she did toward me.
27546 ^ always for the poor you have with you,
27553 ^ and whenever you desire
27556 ^ you are able
27557 ^ them good to do;
27560 ^ me however not always do you have.
27565 ^ what she could, she did.
27568 ^ she came beforehand
27569 ^ to anoint the body of me for the burial.
27576 ^ truly now i say to you,
27580 ^ wherever if shall be proclaimed the gospel in whole the world,
27589 ^ also
27590 ^ what has done this [woman] will be spoken of for a memorial of her.
27597 ^ and judas iscariot, - one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests,
27608 ^ that him he might betray to them.
27612 ^ - and
27614 ^ having heard, they rejoiced,
27616 ^ and promised
27618 ^ him money to give.
27621 ^ and he was seeking
27623 ^ how him conveniently he might deliver up.
27627 ^ and on the first day - of unleavened [bread],
27633 ^ when the passover lamb they were to sacrifice, say to him the disciples of him,
27642 ^ where do you desire [that],
27644 ^ having gone, we should prepare
27646 ^ that you may eat the passover?
27650 ^ and he sends forth two of the disciples of him
27656 ^ and says to them,
27659 ^ go into the city,
27663 ^ and will meet you a man,
27667 ^ a pitcher of water carrying.
27670 ^ follow him.
27672 ^ and wherever if he might enter,
27676 ^ say to the master of the house
27679 ^ that the teacher says,
27683 ^ where is the guest room of me,
27688 ^ where the passover with the disciples of me i may eat?
27696 ^ and he you will show an upper room large,
27702 ^ having been furnished [and] ready.
27704 ^ and there prepare for us.
27708 ^ and went away - his disciples,
27712 ^ and came into the city,
27717 ^ and found
27719 ^ as he had said to them,
27722 ^ and they prepared the passover.
27726 ^ and evening having arrived,
27729 ^ he comes with the twelve.
27733 ^ and as were reclining they,
27736 ^ and were eating,
27738 ^ - jesus said,
27741 ^ truly i say to you
27744 ^ that one of you will betray me,
27750 ^ who is eating with me.
27754 ^ they began
27755 ^ to be grieved
27756 ^ and to say to him one by one,
27762 ^ surely not i?
27764 ^ - and he said to them,
27768 ^ [it is] one of the twelve,
27771 ^ who is dipping with me in the bowl.
27778 ^ for - indeed
27781 ^ the son - of man goes
27785 ^ as it has been written concerning him;
27789 ^ woe however to the man that
27794 ^ by whom the son - of man is betrayed;
27801 ^ better for him [it were]
27803 ^ if not had been born the man that.
27809 ^ and they were eating of them,
27812 ^ having taken bread,
27814 ^ having spoken a blessing, he broke,
27816 ^ and gave to them,
27819 ^ and said,
27821 ^ take;
27822 ^ this is the body of me.
27827 ^ and
27828 ^ having taken the cup,
27830 ^ having given thanks, he gave [it] to them,
27833 ^ and they drank of it all.
27838 ^ and he said to them,
27841 ^ this is the blood of me of the covenant,
27848 ^ which is being poured out for many.
27852 ^ truly i say to you
27855 ^ that no more never not will i drink of the fruit of the vine, until the day that
27869 ^ when it i drink anew in the kingdom - of god.
27878 ^ and
27879 ^ having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount - of olives.
27886 ^ and says to them - jesus
27891 ^ -, all you will fall away,
27894 ^ for it has been written:
27896 ^ i will strike the shepherd,
27899 ^ and the sheep will be scattered.’
27903 ^ but
27904 ^ after - having arisen, i will go before you into - galilee.
27913 ^ - and
27915 ^ peter was saying to him,
27918 ^ if even all will fall away,
27922 ^ yet not i.
27925 ^ and says to him - jesus,
27930 ^ truly i say to you
27933 ^ that yourself now this - night,
27939 ^ before that twice [the] rooster
27943 ^ crows, three times me you will deny.
27947 ^ - and emphatically he kept saying,
27951 ^ if it is needful
27953 ^ of me to die with you,
27956 ^ no not you will i deny.
27960 ^ likewise now also all of them were saying.
27965 ^ and they come to a place,
27969 ^ of which the name [is] gethsemane;
27973 ^ and he says to the disciples of him,
27978 ^ sit here,
27980 ^ while i shall pray.
27982 ^ and he takes - peter and - james and - john with him;
27994 ^ and he began
27996 ^ to be greatly awe-struck
27997 ^ and deeply distressed.
27999 ^ and he says to them,
28002 ^ very sorrowful is the soul of me, even to death;
28009 ^ remain here
28011 ^ and watch.
28013 ^ and
28014 ^ having gone forward a little, he fell upon the ground
28020 ^ and was praying
28022 ^ that, if possible it is,
28026 ^ might pass from him the hour.
28031 ^ and he was saying,
28033 ^ abba, - father, all things [are] possible to you;
28039 ^ take away the cup this from me;
28045 ^ but not
28047 ^ what i will,
28050 ^ but what you.
28053 ^ and he comes
28055 ^ and finds them
28058 ^ sleeping.
28059 ^ and he says - to peter,
28063 ^ simon, are you asleep?
28065 ^ not were you able
28067 ^ one hour to watch?
28070 ^ watch
28071 ^ and pray,
28073 ^ so that not you may enter into temptation.
28078 ^ the indeed
28080 ^ spirit [is] willing,
28082 ^ - but
28084 ^ the flesh weak.
28086 ^ and
28087 ^ again having gone away, he prayed,
28090 ^ the same thing having said.
28094 ^ and
28095 ^ again having returned, he found them
28099 ^ sleeping.
28100 ^ were for of them the eyes
28105 ^ heavy;
28106 ^ and not they knew
28109 ^ what they should answer him.
28112 ^ and he comes the third time,
28116 ^ and says to them,
28119 ^ are you sleeping - still
28122 ^ and taking your rest.
28124 ^ it is enough;
28125 ^ has come the hour;
28128 ^ behold,
28129 ^ is delivered up the son - of man into the hands of the sinful.
28139 ^ rise,
28140 ^ let us go;
28141 ^ behold,
28142 ^ the [one] betraying me has drawn near!
28146 ^ and immediately while yet of him speaking,
28151 ^ comes up judas, one of the twelve, and with him a crowd
28160 ^ with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
28173 ^ had given then
28175 ^ the [one] delivering up him a sign to them,
28180 ^ saying:
28181 ^ whomever - i shall kiss,
28184 ^ he is;
28186 ^ seize him
28188 ^ and lead [him] away securely.
28191 ^ and
28192 ^ having arrived,
28193 ^ immediately having come up to him, he says,
28197 ^ rabbi!
28198 ^ and he kissed him.
28201 ^ - and they laid the hands on him
28207 ^ and seized him.
28210 ^ one then,
28212 ^ a certain
28213 ^ of those standing by,
28215 ^ having drawn the sword, struck the servant of the high priest
28223 ^ and cut off of him the ear.
28228 ^ and
28229 ^ answering, - jesus said to them,
28234 ^ as against a robber are you come out with swords and clubs
28242 ^ to capture me?
28244 ^ every day i was with you in the temple
28252 ^ teaching,
28253 ^ and not you did seize me.
28257 ^ but [it is] that may be fulfilled the scriptures.
28262 ^ and
28263 ^ having left him, fled all.
28267 ^ and [a] young man certain was following him,
28272 ^ having cast a linen cloth about [his] naked [body];
28276 ^ and they seize him,
28279 ^ - and
28281 ^ having left behind the linen cloth, naked he fled.
28286 ^ and they led away - jesus to the high priest.
28293 ^ and come together all the chief priests, and the elders, and the scribes.
28304 ^ and - peter from afar off followed him, as far as within to the court of the high priest;
28318 ^ and he was
28320 ^ sitting with the officers
28324 ^ and warming himself at the fire.
28329 ^ - and
28331 ^ the chief priests and all the council were seeking against - jesus testimony,
28341 ^ to - put to death him,
28345 ^ but not they were finding [any].
28348 ^ many for were bearing false testimony against him,
28353 ^ but alike their testimonies not were.
28359 ^ and some
28361 ^ having risen up, were bearing false testimony against him,
28365 ^ saying,
28366 ^ - we heard him
28370 ^ saying
28371 ^ -, i will destroy the temple this, the [one] made with hands,
28379 ^ and in three days another, not made with hands, i will build.
28386 ^ and neither thus alike was the testimony of them.
28394 ^ and
28395 ^ having stood up the high priest in the midst, he questioned - jesus,
28403 ^ saying,
28404 ^ not answer you nothing?
28407 ^ what [is it] these you testify against?
28411 ^ - but he was silent,
28414 ^ and not did he answer nothing.
28418 ^ again the high priest was questioning him,
28423 ^ and says to him,
28426 ^ you are the christ, the son of the blessed [one]?
28434 ^ - and
28436 ^ jesus said,
28438 ^ i am.
28440 ^ and you will see the son - of man
28446 ^ at [the] right hand sitting
28449 ^ of power,
28451 ^ and coming with the clouds of heaven.
28458 ^ - and
28460 ^ the high priest,
28461 ^ having torn the garments of him, says,
28466 ^ what any more need have we
28470 ^ of witnesses?
28471 ^ you heard the blasphemy.
28474 ^ what to you does it appear?
28477 ^ - and
28479 ^ all condemned
28481 ^ him deserving to be
28484 ^ of death.
28485 ^ and began some
28488 ^ to spit upon him,
28490 ^ and to cover up of him the face,
28495 ^ and to strike him,
28498 ^ and to say to him,
28501 ^ prophesy!
28502 ^ and the officers with the palms him received.
28508 ^ and being - peter below in the courtyard,
28516 ^ comes one of the servant girls of the high priest,
28522 ^ and
28523 ^ having seen - peter
28526 ^ warming himself,
28527 ^ having looked at him, she says,
28530 ^ also you with the nazarene were,
28536 ^ - jesus.
28538 ^ - but he denied [it],
28541 ^ saying,
28542 ^ neither i know,
28544 ^ nor even understand
28546 ^ you what say.
28549 ^ and he went forth out into the porch;
28555 ^ and the rooster crowed.
28558 ^ and the servant girl,
28561 ^ having seen him, began
28564 ^ again to say
28566 ^ to those standing by
28568 ^ -, this [one] of them is.
28573 ^ - but again he denied.
28577 ^ and after a little, again
28581 ^ those standing by were saying - to peter,
28586 ^ truly of them you are,
28590 ^ also for a galilean you are.”
28594 ^ - but he began
28597 ^ to curse
28598 ^ and to swear
28600 ^ -, not i know the man this,
28606 ^ whom you speak of!
28608 ^ and immediately for the second time a rooster crowed.
28614 ^ and remembered - peter the word
28620 ^ that had said to him - jesus
28625 ^ -, before [the] rooster crows, twice
28630 ^ three times me you will deny.
28633 ^ and
28634 ^ having broken down, he began to weep.
28636 ^ and early in the morning,
28639 ^ a counsel having formed the chief priests, with the elders, and scribes, and all the council,
28652 ^ having bound - jesus, they led [him] away
28656 ^ and delivered [him] to pilate.
28659 ^ and questioned him - pilate,
28664 ^ you are the king of the jews?
28670 ^ - and
28672 ^ answering to him, he says,
28675 ^ you have said.
28677 ^ and were accusing him the chief priests of many things.
28683 ^ - and
28685 ^ pilate again began to question him,
28689 ^ saying,
28690 ^ not answer you nothing?
28693 ^ see
28694 ^ how many things you they testify against!
28697 ^ - but
28699 ^ jesus no longer nothing answered,
28703 ^ so as to amaze - pilate.
28707 ^ at then
28709 ^ [the] feast, he used to release to them one prisoner,
28714 ^ whom they requested.
28716 ^ there was then
28718 ^ the [one] called barabbas,
28721 ^ with the rebels having been bound,
28725 ^ who in the insurrection murder had committed.
28731 ^ and
28732 ^ having cried out, the crowd began
28736 ^ to beg [him to do]
28737 ^ as usually he did for them.
28740 ^ - but
28742 ^ pilate answered them,
28745 ^ saying,
28746 ^ wish you [that]
28747 ^ i should release to you the king of the jews?
28753 ^ he was aware for
28755 ^ that because of envy had delivered up him the chief priests.
28762 ^ - but
28764 ^ the chief priests stirred up the crowd
28768 ^ so that instead - barabbas he might release to them.
28774 ^ - and
28776 ^ pilate
28777 ^ again answering, was saying to them,
28781 ^ what then do you wish [that]
28784 ^ i should do
28785 ^ to him you call the king of the jews?
28791 ^ - and again they cried out,
28795 ^ crucify him!
28797 ^ - and
28799 ^ pilate was saying to them,
28802 ^ what indeed did he commit
28805 ^ evil?
28806 ^ - but much more they shouted,
28810 ^ crucify him!
28812 ^ - and
28814 ^ pilate,
28815 ^ desiring
28816 ^ to the crowd that which [was] satisfactory to do, released to them - barabbas,
28825 ^ and he delivered - jesus,
28829 ^ having flogged [him],
28830 ^ that he might be crucified.
28832 ^ - and
28834 ^ the soldiers led away him into the palace,
28840 ^ that is [the] praetorium,
28843 ^ and they call together all the cohort.
28848 ^ and they put on him purple,
28852 ^ and placed on him,
28855 ^ having twisted together of thorns a crown,
28858 ^ and they began
28860 ^ to salute him,
28862 ^ hail, king of the jews!
28866 ^ and they kept striking his - head with a reed,
28872 ^ and spitting on him;
28875 ^ and,
28876 ^ bending the knees, they were kneeling down to him.
28881 ^ and when they had mocked him,
28885 ^ they took off him the purple
28889 ^ and put on him the garments his
28895 ^ and they are leading out him,
28898 ^ that they might crucify him.
28901 ^ and they compel,
28903 ^ passing by one, simon of cyrene,
28907 ^ coming from the country, the father of alexander and rufus,
28915 ^ that he might carry the cross of him.
28920 ^ and they bring him to - golgotha, a place
28927 ^ which is
28929 ^ translated, of a skull place.
28932 ^ and they were offering him,
28935 ^ having been mixed with myrrh, wine;
28937 ^ he however not did take [it].
28941 ^ and having crucified him,
28944 ^ also they divided the garments of him,
28949 ^ casting lots for them,
28953 ^ who what should take.
28956 ^ it was then [the] hour third,
28960 ^ and they crucified him.
28963 ^ and there was the inscription of the accusation against him
28970 ^ having been written:
28971 ^ the king of the jews.
28975 ^ and with him they crucify two robbers, one at [the] right hand, and one at [the] left of him.
28989 ^ and
28990 ^ those passing by were railing at him,
28994 ^ shaking the heads of them
28998 ^ and saying,
29000 ^ aha!
29001 ^ the [one] destroying the temple
29005 ^ and building [it] in three days,
29010 ^ save yourself,
29012 ^ having descended from the cross!
29016 ^ likewise also the chief priests,
29020 ^ mocking among one another, with the scribes, were saying,
29027 ^ others he saved;
29029 ^ himself not he is able to save.
29033 ^ the christ, the king of israel, let him descend now from the cross,
29043 ^ that we might see
29045 ^ and believe!
29047 ^ and
29048 ^ those being crucified with him were upbraiding him.
29054 ^ and having arrived [the] hour sixth,
29058 ^ darkness came over all the land, until [the] hour ninth.
29067 ^ and at the ninth hour, cried out - jesus in a voice loud,
29076 ^ eloi, eloi, lema sabachthani?
29080 ^ which is
29082 ^ translated,
29083 ^ - god of me, - god of me, to why have you forsaken me?”
29093 ^ and some
29095 ^ of those standing by,
29097 ^ having heard, were saying,
29099 ^ behold,
29100 ^ elijah he calls.
29102 ^ having run then one
29105 ^ and having filled a sponge with vinegar,
29109 ^ having put [it] on a reed, gave to drink him,
29113 ^ saying,
29114 ^ let be;
29115 ^ let us see
29116 ^ if comes elijah
29119 ^ to take down him.
29121 ^ - but
29123 ^ jesus,
29124 ^ having uttered a cry loud, breathed his last.
29128 ^ and the veil of the temple was torn into two from top to bottom.
29140 ^ having seen then the centurion
29144 ^ - standing from opposite of him
29149 ^ that thus he breathed his last, he said,
29153 ^ truly this - man [the] son of god was!
29160 ^ there were then also women
29164 ^ from afar off looking on,
29167 ^ among whom also mary - magdalene, and mary the of james the least and of joseph mother, and salome,
29184 ^ who,
29185 ^ when he was in - galilee, had been following him
29192 ^ and had been ministering to him, and other many,
29198 ^ those having come up with him to jerusalem.
29203 ^ and already evening having arrived,
29207 ^ since it was [the] preparation,
29210 ^ that is, the day before sabbath,
29213 ^ having come, joseph - from arimathea, a prominent council member,
29220 ^ who also
29222 ^ himself was
29224 ^ waiting for the kingdom - of god,
29229 ^ having boldness, went in to - pilate
29234 ^ and asked for the body - of jesus.
29240 ^ - and
29242 ^ pilate wondered
29244 ^ if already he were dead.
29247 ^ and
29248 ^ having called to [him] the centurion, he questioned him
29253 ^ whether already he had died.
29256 ^ and
29257 ^ having known [it] from the centurion, he granted the body - to joseph.
29266 ^ and
29267 ^ having bought a linen cloth,
29269 ^ having taken down him, he wrapped [him] in the linen cloth
29274 ^ and laid him in a tomb
29279 ^ which was
29281 ^ cut out of a rock.
29284 ^ and he rolled a stone to the door of the tomb.
29292 ^ - and
29294 ^ mary - magdalene and mary the [mother] of joseph were watching
29302 ^ where he was laid.
29304 ^ and having passed the sabbath,
29308 ^ mary - magdalene, and mary the [mother] - of james, and salome, bought spices,
29320 ^ that
29321 ^ having come, they might anoint him.
29324 ^ and very early on the first [day] of the week, they come to the tomb,
29335 ^ having arisen the sun.
29338 ^ and they were saying among themselves,
29342 ^ who will roll away for us the stone from the door of the tomb?
29352 ^ and
29353 ^ having looked up they see
29355 ^ that has been rolled away the stone;
29359 ^ it was for large extremely.
29363 ^ and
29364 ^ having entered into the tomb, they saw a young man
29370 ^ sitting on the right,
29374 ^ clothed in a robe white,
29377 ^ and they were greatly amazed.
29379 ^ - and he says to them,
29383 ^ not be amazed.
29385 ^ jesus you seek,
29387 ^ the nazarene,
29389 ^ the [one] having been crucified.
29391 ^ he is risen!
29392 ^ not he is here!
29395 ^ behold
29396 ^ the place
29398 ^ where they laid him.
29401 ^ but go,
29403 ^ say the disciples of him and - to peter
29410 ^ that he goes before you into - galilee;
29416 ^ there him will you see,
29419 ^ as he said to you.
29422 ^ and
29423 ^ having gone out, they fled from the tomb.
29428 ^ had seized for them trembling and amazement,
29434 ^ and to none nothing they spoke;
29438 ^ they were afraid for.
29440 ^ having risen now early [the] first [day] of the week, he appeared first to mary - magdalene,
29450 ^ from whom he had cast out seven demons.
29455 ^ she
29456 ^ having gone, told [it]
29458 ^ to those with him,
29461 ^ having been
29462 ^ mourning
29463 ^ and weeping.
29465 ^ and they,
29466 ^ having heard
29467 ^ that he is alive
29469 ^ and has been seen by her, disbelieved.
29474 ^ after now
29476 ^ these things, to two of them
29480 ^ as they are walking, he appeared in another form,
29485 ^ going into [the] country.
29488 ^ and they,
29489 ^ having gone, told [it] to the rest;
29493 ^ neither them did they believe.
29496 ^ afterward now
29498 ^ were reclining they; to the eleven he appeared
29503 ^ and rebuked the unbelief of them and hardness of heart,
29510 ^ because
29511 ^ those having seen him
29514 ^ arisen not they believed.
29517 ^ and he said to them,
29520 ^ having gone into the world all, proclaim the gospel to all the creation.
29531 ^ the [one] having believed
29533 ^ and having been baptized will be saved;
29536 ^ the [one] however
29538 ^ having disbelieved will be condemned.
29540 ^ signs now
29542 ^ those having believed
29544 ^ these will accompany:
29546 ^ in the name of me demons they will cast out;
29552 ^ with tongues they will speak
29554 ^ new;
29555 ^ and with their hands serpents they will take up;
29561 ^ and if deadly anything they drink,
29565 ^ no not them shall it hurt;
29569 ^ upon [the] sick, hands they will lay,
29573 ^ and well they will be.
29576 ^ - indeed therefore
29579 ^ the lord jesus,
29581 ^ after - speaking to them, was taken up into the heaven
29589 ^ and sat at [the] right hand - of god.
29595 ^ they now
29597 ^ having gone forth, preached everywhere,
29600 ^ the lord working with [them]
29603 ^ and the word confirming by the
29609 ^ accompanying signs.
29611 ^ all moreover
29613 ^ the [things] being instructed to [those] around - peter. promptly they reported
29621 ^ after moreover,
29623 ^ these, also himself - jesus from [the] east and to [the] west, sent out through them, the sacred and imperishable preaching of eternal salvation. amen.
29645 ^ inasmuch as many have undertaken
29648 ^ to draw up a narration concerning the
29652 ^ having been accomplished among us things,
29656 ^ as delivered [them] to us
29659 ^ those from [the] beginning eyewitnesses and servants
29665 ^ having been
29666 ^ of the word,
29668 ^ it seemed good also to me,
29670 ^ having been acquainted from the first with all things, carefully
29674 ^ with method to you to write, most excellent theophilus,
29679 ^ so that you may know
29681 ^ concerning which you were instructed, [of the] things, the certainty.
29687 ^ there was in the days of herod king - of judea a priest certain, named zechariah, of [the] division of abijah,
29702 ^ and wife of him of the daughters of aaron,
29709 ^ and the name of her elizabeth.
29714 ^ they were now righteous both before - god,
29721 ^ walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless.
29731 ^ and no there was to them child,
29736 ^ inasmuch as was - elizabeth barren,
29741 ^ and both
29743 ^ advanced in the years of them were.
29749 ^ it came to pass now
29751 ^ in the fulfilling the priestly service of him, in the order of the division of him before - god,
29764 ^ according to the custom of the priesthood, it fell to him by lot
29770 ^ - to burn incense,
29772 ^ having entered into the temple of the lord.
29778 ^ and all the multitude were
29783 ^ of the people
29785 ^ praying outside at the hour of the incense.
29791 ^ appeared then to him an angel of [the] lord,
29796 ^ standing at [the] right of the altar of the incense.
29803 ^ and was troubled zechariah
29806 ^ having seen [him],
29807 ^ and fear fell upon him.
29812 ^ said then to him the angel,
29818 ^ not fear, zechariah,
29821 ^ because has been heard the prayer of you,
29826 ^ and the wife of you elizabeth will bear a son to you,
29834 ^ and you shall call the name of him john.
29840 ^ and he will be joy to you
29844 ^ and gladness,
29846 ^ and many at the birth of him will rejoice.
29853 ^ he will be for great before the lord;
29859 ^ and wine and strong drink no not shall he drink,
29866 ^ and [of the] spirit holy he will be filled even from [the] womb of [the] mother of him.
29875 ^ and many of the sons of israel he will turn to [the] lord, the god of them.
29886 ^ and he will go forth before him in [the] spirit and power of elijah,
29896 ^ to turn [the] hearts of [the] fathers to [the] children,
29901 ^ and [the] disobedient to [the] wisdom of [the] righteous,
29906 ^ to make ready for [the] lord a people
29909 ^ prepared.
29910 ^ and said zechariah to the angel,
29916 ^ by what will i know this?
29920 ^ i for am an old man,
29924 ^ and the wife of me
29928 ^ is advanced in the years of her.
29933 ^ and
29934 ^ answering, the angel said to him,
29939 ^ i am gabriel,
29942 ^ the [one] standing before - god,
29947 ^ and i was sent
29949 ^ to speak to you,
29952 ^ and to bring glad tidings to you these.
29956 ^ and behold,
29958 ^ you will be
29959 ^ silent,
29960 ^ and not able
29963 ^ to speak
29964 ^ until that day shall take place these things,
29969 ^ in return for that not you did believe the words of me,
29976 ^ which will be fulfilled in the season of them.
29982 ^ and were the people
29986 ^ expecting - zechariah,
29989 ^ and they were wondering
29991 ^ at the delaying in the temple of him.
29998 ^ having come out then, not he was able
30002 ^ to speak to them,
30004 ^ and they recognized
30006 ^ that a vision he had seen in the temple.
30012 ^ and he was
30015 ^ making signs to them,
30017 ^ and remained mute.
30020 ^ and it came to pass,
30022 ^ when were fulfilled the days of the service of him,
30029 ^ he departed to the home of him.
30034 ^ after then
30036 ^ these - days conceived elizabeth the wife of him,
30044 ^ and hid herself months five,
30049 ^ saying,
30050 ^ - thus to me has done the lord, in [the] days
30057 ^ in which he looked upon [me],
30059 ^ to take away [the] disgrace of me among men.
30064 ^ in now
30066 ^ the month - sixth, was sent the angel gabriel by - god to a city - of galilee,
30081 ^ whose name [was] nazareth, to a virgin
30086 ^ betrothed to a man,
30088 ^ whose name [was] joseph, of [the] house of david;
30094 ^ and the name of the virgin [was] mary.
30100 ^ and
30101 ^ having come to her, he said,
30105 ^ greetings,
30106 ^ [you] favored with grace!
30107 ^ the lord [is] with you.”
30111 ^ - and at the statement she was troubled,
30117 ^ and was pondering
30119 ^ what kind might be the salutation this.
30124 ^ and said the angel to her,
30129 ^ not fear, mary;
30132 ^ you have found for favor with - god;
30138 ^ and behold,
30140 ^ you will conceive in womb,
30143 ^ and will bring forth a son,
30146 ^ and you shall call the name of him jesus.
30152 ^ he will be great,
30155 ^ and son of [the] most high he will be called;
30159 ^ and will give him [the] lord - god the throne of david, of the father of him;
30171 ^ and he will reign over the house of jacob to the ages;
30180 ^ and of the kingdom of him not there will be
30186 ^ an end!
30187 ^ said then mary to the angel,
30193 ^ how will be this,
30196 ^ since a man not i know?
30200 ^ and
30201 ^ answering, the angel said to her,
30206 ^ [the] spirit holy will come upon you,
30211 ^ and power of [the] most high will overshadow you;
30216 ^ therefore also the
30219 ^ being born holy [one] will be called [the] son of god.
30224 ^ and behold,
30226 ^ elizabeth, the relative of you,
30230 ^ also she has conceived a son in old age her,
30237 ^ and this month [the] sixth is to her
30243 ^ who [was] called barren.
30246 ^ for not will be impossible with - god every thing.
30254 ^ said then mary,
30257 ^ behold,
30258 ^ the handmaid of [the] lord.
30261 ^ may it happen to me according to the word of you.
30267 ^ and departed from her the angel.
30273 ^ having risen up then mary in the days this, she went into the hill country with haste, to a town of judah,
30289 ^ and she entered into the house of zechariah
30295 ^ and greeted - elizabeth.
30299 ^ and it came to pass,
30301 ^ as heard the greeting - of mary - elizabeth,
30309 ^ leaped the baby in the womb of her;
30316 ^ and was filled with [the] spirit holy - elizabeth,
30322 ^ and she cried out in a voice loud
30326 ^ and said,
30328 ^ blessed are you among women,
30332 ^ and
30333 ^ blessed is the fruit of the womb of you.
30339 ^ and from where to me this,
30343 ^ that should come the mother of the lord of me to me?
30352 ^ behold for,
30354 ^ as came the voice of the greeting of you into the ears of me,
30365 ^ leaped in exultation the baby in the womb of me.
30374 ^ and blessed [is]
30376 ^ the [one] having believed
30378 ^ that there will be a fulfillment
30381 ^ to the things spoken to her from [the] lord.
30386 ^ and said mary:
30389 ^ magnifies the soul of me the lord,
30395 ^ and rejoices the spirit of me in - god, the savior of me.
30406 ^ for he has looked upon the humiliation of the handmaiden of him.
30414 ^ behold for
30416 ^ from - henceforth will count blessed me all the generations.
30424 ^ for has done to me great things the mighty one.
30430 ^ and holy [is] the name of him.
30435 ^ and the mercy of him [is] to generations and generations,
30443 ^ to those fearing him.
30446 ^ he has shown strength with the arm of him,
30451 ^ he has scattered [the] proud in [the] thought of heart of them.
30456 ^ he has brought down rulers from thrones,
30460 ^ and exalted [the] humble.
30463 ^ [those] hungering he has filled with good things,
30466 ^ and
30467 ^ [those] being rich he has sent away empty.
30470 ^ he has helped israel [the] servant of him,
30474 ^ remembering mercy,
30476 ^ as he spoke to the fathers of us, - to abraham and to the descendants of him to the age.
30491 ^ dwelt then mary with her about months three,
30499 ^ and returned to the home of her.
30505 ^ to now
30507 ^ elizabeth was fulfilled the time
30511 ^ - to give birth for her,
30514 ^ and she bore a son.
30517 ^ and heard the neighbors and - relatives of her
30525 ^ that was magnifying [the] lord the mercy of him with her,
30533 ^ and they were rejoicing with her.
30536 ^ and it came to pass on - day the eighth,
30543 ^ they came
30544 ^ to circumcise the child,
30547 ^ and were calling it after the name of the father of him, zechariah.
30557 ^ and
30558 ^ answering, the mother of him said,
30563 ^ no,
30564 ^ but he will be called john.
30567 ^ and they said to her
30571 ^ -, no one is among the relatives of you,
30578 ^ who is called the name by this.
30583 ^ they were making signs then to the father of him, the
30589 ^ what - he might wish to be called him.
30594 ^ and having asked for a writing tablet,
30597 ^ he wrote,
30598 ^ saying,
30599 ^ john is [the] name of him.
30603 ^ and they marveled all.
30606 ^ was opened then the mouth of him immediately,
30612 ^ and the tongue of him,
30616 ^ and he was speaking,
30618 ^ blessing - god.
30621 ^ and came upon all fear,
30626 ^ those dwelling around them;
30629 ^ and in all the hill country - of judea were being talked about all the things, words these.
30641 ^ and laid [them] up
30643 ^ all those having heard, in the heart of them,
30650 ^ saying,
30651 ^ what then the child this will be?
30657 ^ and for [the] hand of [the] lord was with him.
30664 ^ and zechariah, the father of him, was filled with [the] spirit holy,
30672 ^ and prophesied,
30674 ^ saying,
30675 ^ blessed be [the] lord the god - of israel,
30681 ^ because he has visited
30683 ^ and has performed redemption [on] the people of him,
30689 ^ and has raised up a horn of salvation for us, in [the] house of david of [the] servant of him;
30699 ^ as he spoke by [the] mouth of the holy of old prophets of him,
30709 ^ salvation from [the] enemies of us, and from [the] hand
30716 ^ of all those hating us;
30720 ^ to fulfill mercy toward the fathers of us,
30726 ^ and to remember [the] covenant holy of him, [the] oath
30732 ^ that he swore to abraham, the father of us,
30739 ^ - to grant us,
30742 ^ without fear,
30743 ^ from [the] hand of our enemies having been saved, to serve him, in holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.
30759 ^ and you now, child, prophet of [the] most high will be called;
30766 ^ you will go for before the lord,
30770 ^ to prepare ways of him;
30773 ^ - to give knowledge of salvation to people of him, in forgiveness of [the] sins of them, through [the] affections of compassion of god of us,
30789 ^ in which will visit us [the] sunrise from on high,
30796 ^ to shine upon
30797 ^ those in darkness and in [the] shadow of death
30803 ^ sitting;
30804 ^ - to direct the feet of us into [the] way of peace.
30812 ^ - and
30814 ^ the child continued to grow
30816 ^ and was strengthened in spirit;
30819 ^ and he was in the deserted places until [the] day of appearance of him to - israel.
30831 ^ it came to pass then in the days those,
30837 ^ went out a decree from caesar augustus
30842 ^ to register all the world.
30846 ^ this registration first took place [when]
30850 ^ was governing - syria quirinius.
30854 ^ and were going all
30857 ^ to be registered,
30858 ^ each to the of themselves city.
30863 ^ went up then also joseph, from - galilee out of [the] town of nazareth, to - judea, to [the] city of david,
30879 ^ which is called bethlehem,
30882 ^ because of - being his of [the] house and family of david,
30891 ^ to register with mary,
30894 ^ the [one] being betrothed to him,
30897 ^ she being with child.
30899 ^ it came to pass then
30901 ^ in their being - there,
30906 ^ were fulfilled the days
30909 ^ of the giving birth of her.
30912 ^ and she brought forth the son of her, the firstborn,
30919 ^ and wrapped in swaddling cloths him,
30922 ^ and laid him in a manger,
30927 ^ because not there was for them a place in the inn.
30935 ^ and shepherds were in the region - same,
30943 ^ lodging in the fields
30944 ^ and keeping watch - by night over the flock of them.
30953 ^ and an angel of [the] lord stood by them,
30958 ^ and [the] glory of [the] lord shone around them,
30963 ^ and they feared [with] fear great.
30967 ^ and said to them the angel,
30972 ^ not fear;
30974 ^ behold, for
30976 ^ i bring good news to you [of] joy great,
30980 ^ which will be to all the people.
30985 ^ for has been born to you today a savior,
30990 ^ who is christ [the] lord, in [the] city of david.
30997 ^ and this [is] to you the sign:
31002 ^ you will find a baby
31004 ^ wrapped in swaddling cloths,
31005 ^ and lying in a manger.
31009 ^ and suddenly there came with the angel a multitude of [the] host heavenly,
31018 ^ praising - god
31021 ^ and saying:
31023 ^ glory in [the] highest to god,
31027 ^ and on earth peace among men with whom he is pleased!
31034 ^ and it came to pass,
31036 ^ as were departing from them into the heaven the angels,
31045 ^ the shepherds were saying to one another,
31050 ^ let us go through indeed as far as bethlehem,
31054 ^ and let us see the word this
31059 ^ that has come to pass,
31061 ^ which the lord has made known to us.
31066 ^ and they came
31068 ^ having hurried,
31069 ^ and found - both mary and - joseph, and the baby,
31080 ^ lying in the manger.
31084 ^ having seen now, they proclaimed abroad concerning the saying
31090 ^ - having been told them concerning the child this.
31097 ^ and
31098 ^ all those having heard marveled
31102 ^ concerning the things having been spoken by the shepherds to them.
31110 ^ - but
31112 ^ mary all was treasuring up
31115 ^ - matters these,
31118 ^ pondering [them] in the heart of her.
31123 ^ and returned the shepherds,
31127 ^ glorifying
31128 ^ and praising - god for all things
31134 ^ which they had heard
31136 ^ and seen,
31138 ^ as it was said to them.
31142 ^ and when were fulfilled days eight
31147 ^ - to circumcise him, then was called the name of him jesus,
31156 ^ which he had been called by the angel
31161 ^ before - was conceived he in the womb.
31168 ^ and when were fulfilled the days of the purification of them according to the law of moses,
31180 ^ they brought him to jerusalem,
31184 ^ to present to the lord
31187 ^ as it has been written in [the] law of [the] lord
31192 ^ -: every male
31195 ^ opening a womb holy to the lord shall be called,”
31201 ^ and - to offer a sacrifice,
31205 ^ according to that having been said in the law of [the] lord,
31212 ^ a pair of turtle doves
31214 ^ or two young pigeons.”
31218 ^ and behold,
31220 ^ a man there was in jerusalem,
31224 ^ whose name [was] simeon;
31227 ^ and the man this [was] righteous and devout,
31234 ^ waiting for [the] consolation - of israel,
31238 ^ and [the] spirit was
31241 ^ holy upon him.
31244 ^ and it was
31246 ^ to him divinely revealed by the spirit - holy
31253 ^ not to see death
31256 ^ before that - he should see the christ of [the] lord.
31263 ^ and he came in the spirit into the temple;
31271 ^ and
31272 ^ in the [time when] were bringing in the parents the child jesus,
31280 ^ the [thing] were doing they
31283 ^ according to that having become customary by the law for him, then he received him into the arms,
31297 ^ and blessed - god,
31301 ^ and said:
31303 ^ now you dismiss the servant of you, lord, according to the word of you, in peace;
31315 ^ for have seen the eyes of me the salvation of you,
31323 ^ which you have prepared before [the] face of all the peoples,
31330 ^ a light for revelation of [the] gentiles,
31334 ^ and glory of [the] people of you, israel.
31339 ^ and were the father of him, and the mother,
31347 ^ marveling
31348 ^ at the things having been spoken concerning him.
31353 ^ and blessed them simeon,
31357 ^ and said to mary the mother of him:
31364 ^ behold,
31365 ^ this [child] is appointed for [the] falling and rising up of many in - israel, and for a sign
31378 ^ spoken against —
31379 ^ and of you also
31382 ^ of her the soul will go through a sword —
31387 ^ so that - may be revealed of many hearts [the] thoughts.
31394 ^ and there was anna, a prophetess, daughter of phanuel, of [the] tribe of asher,
31403 ^ she
31404 ^ being advanced in years great,
31408 ^ having lived with a husband years seven from the marriage of herself,
31417 ^ and she [was] a widow of about years eighty [and] four,
31424 ^ who not departed the temple,
31429 ^ with fastings and prayers serving night and day.
31436 ^ and she at that hour
31440 ^ having come up, was giving praise - to god,
31444 ^ and was speaking concerning him
31448 ^ to all those waiting for [the] redemption of jerusalem.
31453 ^ and when they had performed everything - according to the law of [the] lord,
31462 ^ they returned to - galilee, to the town of them, nazareth.
31470 ^ - and
31472 ^ the child continued to grow
31474 ^ and become strong,
31476 ^ being filled with wisdom,
31478 ^ and [the] grace of god was upon him.
31484 ^ and were going the parents of him every year to jerusalem at the feast of the passover.
31497 ^ and when he was years [old] twelve,
31502 ^ having gone up they according to the custom of the feast,
31509 ^ and having completed the days,
31513 ^ in the returning of them, remained behind jesus the boy in jerusalem.
31523 ^ but not knew the parents of him.
31529 ^ having supposed now
31531 ^ him to be in their company, they went a day’s journey,
31539 ^ and began seeking him among the relatives and the acquaintances;
31548 ^ and
31549 ^ not having found [him], they returned to jerusalem,
31554 ^ seeking him.
31556 ^ and it came to pass
31558 ^ after days three, they found him
31563 ^ in the temple, sitting in [the] midst of the teachers,
31571 ^ both hearing them
31574 ^ and questioning them.
31577 ^ were amazed then
31579 ^ all those hearing him at the understanding and the answers of him.
31590 ^ and
31591 ^ having seen him, they were astonished,
31594 ^ and said to him the mother of him,
31601 ^ child why have you done to us thus?
31606 ^ behold,
31607 ^ the father of you, and i,
31611 ^ distressing were seeking you.
31614 ^ and he said to them,
31618 ^ why [is it]
31619 ^ that you were seeking me?
31622 ^ not knew you
31624 ^ that
31625 ^ in the [house] of the father of me it behooves to be me?”
31633 ^ and they not understood the word
31639 ^ that he spoke to them.
31642 ^ and he went down with them
31646 ^ and came to nazareth,
31650 ^ and he was
31652 ^ subject to them.
31654 ^ and the mother of him was treasuring up all the [these] matters in the heart of her.
31666 ^ and jesus continued to advance in - wisdom and stature, and in favor with god and men.
31680 ^ in year then
31683 ^ fifteenth of the reign of tiberius caesar,
31688 ^ being governor pontius pilate - of judea,
31693 ^ and being tetrarch - of galilee herod,
31698 ^ philip now
31700 ^ the brother of him being tetrarch - of ituraea and of trachonitis [the] region,
31709 ^ and lysanias - of abilene being tetrarch, during [the] high priesthood of annas and caiaphas, came [the] word of god upon john, - of zechariah son, in the wilderness.
31730 ^ and he went into all the surrounding region of the jordan,
31738 ^ proclaiming a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins,
31744 ^ as it has been written in [the] book of [the] words of isaiah the prophet:
31752 ^ [the] voice
31753 ^ of one crying in the wilderness,
31757 ^ prepare the way of [the] lord;
31761 ^ straight make the paths of him.
31766 ^ every valley will be filled,
31769 ^ and every mountain and hill will be made low;
31775 ^ and will become the crooked into straight,
31781 ^ and the rough into ways smooth;
31787 ^ and will see all flesh the salvation - of god.”
31795 ^ he was saying therefore to the coming out crowds
31800 ^ to be baptized by him,
31803 ^ offspring of vipers, who forewarned you
31808 ^ to flee from
31810 ^ the coming wrath?
31813 ^ produce therefore fruits worthy - of repentance;
31819 ^ and not begin
31822 ^ to say in yourselves,
31825 ^ [as] father we have - abraham.
31829 ^ i say for to you,
31832 ^ that is able - god
31836 ^ from - stones these to raise up children - to abraham.
31844 ^ already now also the ax to the root of the trees is applied;
31855 ^ every therefore
31857 ^ tree
31858 ^ not producing fruit good is cut down
31863 ^ and into [the] fire is thrown.
31867 ^ and were asking him the crowds,
31872 ^ saying,
31873 ^ what then shall we do?
31876 ^ answering now, he was saying to them,
31880 ^ the [one] having two tunics, let him impart
31885 ^ to the [one] none
31887 ^ having;
31888 ^ and
31889 ^ the [one] having food, likewise let him do.
31894 ^ came then also tax collectors
31898 ^ to be baptized,
31899 ^ and they said to him,
31903 ^ teacher, what shall we do?
31906 ^ - and he said to them,
31911 ^ nothing more
31913 ^ beyond that having been appointed to you collect.
31918 ^ were asking then him also
31922 ^ those being soldiers,
31923 ^ saying,
31924 ^ what shall do also we?
31928 ^ and he said to them,
31931 ^ no one extort
31933 ^ nor accuse falsely,
31935 ^ and be content with the wages of you.
31940 ^ are expecting then the people
31944 ^ and wondering all in the hearts of them concerning - john,
31954 ^ whether ever he might be the christ.
31959 ^ answered
31960 ^ saying [to] all - john,
31964 ^ i indeed with water baptize you;
31969 ^ comes however the [one] mightier than i,
31974 ^ of whom not i am worthy
31978 ^ to untie the strap of the sandals of him;
31984 ^ he you will baptize with [the] spirit holy, and with fire,
31992 ^ of whom the winnowing fork [is] in the hand of him,
31999 ^ to clear the threshing floor of him
32003 ^ and to gather the wheat into the barn of him.
32011 ^ - but
32013 ^ the chaff he will burn up with fire unquenchable.
32017 ^ many indeed therefore other
32021 ^ things exhorting, he was preaching the good news to the people.
32026 ^ - and
32028 ^ herod the tetrarch,
32031 ^ being reproved by him concerning herodias, the wife of the brother of him, and concerning all
32044 ^ that had done
32046 ^ [the] evils - herod, added yet this to all:
32054 ^ also he locked up - john in prison.
32060 ^ it came to pass now
32062 ^ in - having been baptized all the people,
32068 ^ and jesus having been baptized,
32071 ^ and having prayed,
32073 ^ was opened the heaven,
32076 ^ and descended the spirit - holy in a bodily form as a dove upon him,
32088 ^ and a voice out of heaven came:
32093 ^ you are the son of me, the beloved;
32100 ^ in you i am well pleased.
32103 ^ and himself was
32106 ^ jesus
32107 ^ beginning about years [old] thirty,
32111 ^ being son,
32113 ^ as was supposed, of joseph, - of heli, - of matthat, - of levi, - of melchi, - of jannai, - of joseph, - of mattathias, - of amos, - of nahum, - of esli, - of naggai, - of maath, - of mattathias, - of semein, - of josech, - of joda, - of joannen, - of rhesa, - of zerubbabel, - of shealtiel, - of neri, - of melchi, - of addi, - of cosam, - of elmadam, - of er, - of joshua, - of eliezer, - of jorim, - of matthat, - of levi, - of simeon, - of judah, - of joseph, - of jonam, - of eliakim, - of melea, - of menna, - of mattatha, - of nathan, - of david, - of jesse, - of obed, - of boaz, - of sala, - of nahshon, - of amminadab, - of admin, - of arni, - of hezron, - of perez, - of judah, - of jacob, - of isaac, - of abraham, - of terah, - of nahor, - of serug, - of reu, - of peleg, - of heber, - of shelah, - of cainan, - of arphaxad, - of shem, - of noah, - of lamech, - of methuselah, - of enoch, - of jared, - of mahalalel, - of cainan, - of enosh, - of seth, - of adam, - of god.
32268 ^ jesus then,
32270 ^ full of [the] spirit holy, returned from the jordan
32277 ^ and was led by the spirit into the wilderness,
32285 ^ days forty being tempted by the devil.
32291 ^ and not he ate nothing in the days those,
32299 ^ and having ended they,
32302 ^ he was hungry.
32303 ^ said then to him the devil,
32308 ^ if [the] son you are
32311 ^ - of god,
32313 ^ speak to the stone this,
32317 ^ that it should become bread.
32320 ^ and answered to him - jesus,
32326 ^ it has been written
32327 ^ -: not on bread alone shall live the man.’
32335 ^ and
32336 ^ having led up him, he showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
32348 ^ and said to him the devil,
32353 ^ to you will i give the authority this all, and the glory of it;
32363 ^ for to me it has been delivered,
32366 ^ and
32367 ^ to whom if i wish, i give it.
32372 ^ you therefore,
32374 ^ if you will worship before me,
32378 ^ will be yours all.
32381 ^ and
32382 ^ answering, - jesus said to him,
32387 ^ it has been written:
32388 ^ [the] lord - god of you, you shall worship
32393 ^ and him only you shall serve.’
32397 ^ he led also him to jerusalem
32402 ^ and set upon the pinnacle of the temple,
32409 ^ and said to him,
32412 ^ if [the] son you are
32415 ^ - of god,
32417 ^ cast yourself from here down.
32421 ^ it has been written for
32423 ^ -: to the angels of him he will give orders concerning you,
32430 ^ - to guard you;
32433 ^ and - in [their] hands will they bear you,
32439 ^ lest ever you strike against a stone the foot of you.’
32446 ^ and
32447 ^ answering, said to him - jesus
32452 ^ -, it has been said,
32454 ^ not you shall test [the] lord the god of you.’
32460 ^ and
32461 ^ having finished every temptation, the devil departed from him until an opportune time.
32471 ^ and returned - jesus in the power of the spirit to - galilee;
32483 ^ and a report went out into all the surrounding region concerning him.
32492 ^ and he was teaching in the synagogues of them,
32499 ^ being glorified by all.
32502 ^ and he came to nazareth,
32506 ^ where he had been
32508 ^ brought up;
32509 ^ and he entered
32511 ^ according to the custom to him, on the day of the sabbaths, into the synagogue,
32523 ^ and stood up
32525 ^ to read.
32526 ^ and there was given to him [the] scroll of the prophet isaiah,
32533 ^ and
32534 ^ having unrolled the scroll, he found the place
32540 ^ where it was
32542 ^ written:
32543 ^ [the] spirit of [the] lord [is] upon me,
32547 ^ of which because he has anointed me
32551 ^ to preach good news to [the] poor.
32553 ^ he has sent me
32555 ^ to proclaim to [the] captives deliverance, and to [the] blind recovery of sight,
32561 ^ to send forth
32562 ^ [the] oppressed in deliverance,
32565 ^ to proclaim [the] year of [the] lord’s favor.”
32569 ^ and
32570 ^ having rolled up the scroll,
32573 ^ having delivered [it] to the attendant, he sat down,
32577 ^ and of all the eyes
32581 ^ in the synagogue were
32585 ^ fixed upon him.
32587 ^ he began then
32589 ^ to say to them
32592 ^ -, today is fulfilled the scripture this, in the hearing of you.
32602 ^ and all were bearing witness to him
32606 ^ and marveling at the words of the grace
32613 ^ that are proceeding out of the mouth of him;
32619 ^ and they were saying,
32621 ^ not the son is
32624 ^ of joseph this?
32626 ^ and he said to them,
32630 ^ surely you will say to me the proverb this,
32636 ^ physician heal yourself!
32639 ^ whatsoever we have heard
32641 ^ has been done in - capernaum,
32645 ^ do also here in the hometown of you.
32652 ^ he said then,
32654 ^ truly i say to you
32657 ^ that no prophet acceptable is in the hometown of him.
32666 ^ in truth now i say to you,
32671 ^ many widows there were in the days of elijah in - israel,
32681 ^ when was shut up the heaven for years three and months six,
32691 ^ when there was a famine great upon all the land;
32699 ^ and to none of them was sent elijah,
32705 ^ if not to zarephath - of sidon, to a woman, a widow.
32714 ^ and many lepers were in - israel in the time of elisha the prophet,
32725 ^ and none of them was cleansed,
32729 ^ if not naaman the syrian.”
32734 ^ and were filled all with anger in the synagogue,
32741 ^ hearing these things;
32743 ^ and
32744 ^ having risen up, they cast him out of [the] city
32750 ^ and led him unto brow of the hill
32757 ^ upon which the town had been built
32762 ^ of them,
32763 ^ in order to throw over him;
32766 ^ he however,
32768 ^ having passed through [the] midst of them, went away.
32773 ^ and he went down to capernaum, a city - of galilee.
32780 ^ and he was
32782 ^ teaching them on the sabbaths;
32787 ^ and they were astonished at the teaching of him,
32793 ^ for with authority was the message of him.
32800 ^ and in the synagogue was a man
32806 ^ having a spirit of a demon unclean;
32810 ^ and he cried out in a voice loud,
32814 ^ ha! what to us and to you, jesus, of nazareth?
32821 ^ are you come
32822 ^ to destroy us?
32824 ^ i know you
32826 ^ who are,
32828 ^ the holy [one] - of god.
32832 ^ and rebuked him - jesus,
32837 ^ saying,
32838 ^ be silent
32839 ^ and come forth out of him!
32843 ^ and
32844 ^ having thrown him the demon into the midst, it came out from him,
32854 ^ in nothing having hurt him.
32857 ^ and came astonishment upon all,
32862 ^ and they were speaking to one another,
32866 ^ saying,
32867 ^ what - word [is] this,
32871 ^ that with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits,
32880 ^ and they come out?
32882 ^ and was spreading the report concerning him into every place of the surrounding region.
32892 ^ having risen up then out of the synagogue, he entered into the house of simon.
32902 ^ [the] mother-in-law then
32904 ^ - of simon was
32907 ^ oppressed with a fever great;
32910 ^ and they appealed to him for her.
32915 ^ and
32916 ^ having stood over her, he rebuked the fever,
32922 ^ and it left her;
32925 ^ immediately then
32927 ^ having arisen, she began to serve them.
32930 ^ at the setting now of the sun,
32934 ^ all
32935 ^ as many as had [any]
32937 ^ ailing with diseases various, brought them to him,
32944 ^ - and
32946 ^ on one each of them, the hands having laid, he would heal them.
32954 ^ were going out now also demons from many,
32960 ^ crying out
32961 ^ and saying
32963 ^ -, you are the son - of god.
32970 ^ and
32971 ^ rebuking [them], not did he allow them
32975 ^ to speak,
32976 ^ because they knew
32978 ^ the christ him to be.
32982 ^ having arrived now daybreak,
32985 ^ having gone out, he went into a solitary place,
32990 ^ and the crowds were seeking him,
32995 ^ and they came up to him
32999 ^ and were detaining him,
33002 ^ of the not
33004 ^ to go from them.
33007 ^ - but he said to them
33012 ^ -,
33013 ^ also to the other towns to preach [the] good news me it behooves, of the kingdom - of god;
33024 ^ because for this have i been sent forth.
33028 ^ and he was
33030 ^ preaching in the synagogues - of judea.
33036 ^ it came to pass then
33038 ^ in - the crowd
33042 ^ pressing on him
33044 ^ also to hear the word of god,
33050 ^ and he was
33053 ^ standing by the lake of gennesaret,
33058 ^ and he saw two boats
33062 ^ lying by the lake;
33066 ^ - but
33068 ^ the fishermen
33069 ^ from them having gone out, were washing the nets.
33075 ^ having entered then into one of the boats,
33081 ^ which was simon’s, he asked him
33086 ^ from the land to put off a little.
33091 ^ having sat down then, from the boat he was teaching the crowds.
33099 ^ when then he left off
33102 ^ speaking,
33103 ^ he said to - simon,
33107 ^ put off into the deep
33111 ^ and let down the nets of you for a catch.
33118 ^ and
33119 ^ answering, simon said,
33122 ^ master,
33123 ^ through whole night having toiled, nothing have we taken;
33129 ^ at however
33131 ^ the word of you, i will let down the nets.
33137 ^ and
33138 ^ this having done, they enclosed a multitude of fishes great;
33144 ^ were breaking now the nets of them.
33149 ^ and they beckoned to the partners in the other boat,
33157 ^ -
33158 ^ having come,
33159 ^ to help them,
33161 ^ and they came
33163 ^ and filled both the boats
33168 ^ so that were sinking they.
33171 ^ having seen now, simon peter fell at the knees of jesus,
33179 ^ saying,
33180 ^ depart from me,
33183 ^ for a man sinful am i, lord.
33188 ^ amazement for laid hold on him, and on all those with him, at the catch of the fish
33202 ^ which they had taken,
33204 ^ likewise now also james and john, [the] sons of zebedee,
33212 ^ who were partners - with simon.
33217 ^ and said to - simon, - jesus,
33224 ^ not fear;
33226 ^ from - now on
33229 ^ men you will be catching.
33232 ^ and
33233 ^ having brought the boats to the land,
33239 ^ having left all, they followed him.
33243 ^ and it came to pass
33245 ^ in - being his in one of the cities,
33253 ^ that behold,
33255 ^ a man full of leprosy,
33258 ^ having seen then - jesus,
33262 ^ having fallen upon [his] face, begged him,
33267 ^ saying,
33268 ^ lord, if you would be willing,
33271 ^ you are able
33272 ^ me to cleanse.
33274 ^ and
33275 ^ having stretched out the hand, he touched him,
33280 ^ saying,
33281 ^ i am willing;
33282 ^ be you cleansed!
33283 ^ and immediately the leprosy departed from him.
33290 ^ and he ordered him
33294 ^ no one to tell:
33296 ^ but
33297 ^ having gone, show yourself to the priest,
33302 ^ and offer for the cleansing of you,
33308 ^ as commanded moses, for a testimony to them.
33314 ^ was spread abroad now still more the report concerning him;
33321 ^ and were coming crowds great
33325 ^ to hear
33326 ^ and to be healed from the sicknesses of them.
33332 ^ he himself now was
33335 ^ withdrawing into the wilderness
33339 ^ and praying.
33341 ^ and it came to pass on one of the days
33347 ^ that he was
33350 ^ teaching,
33351 ^ and there were
33353 ^ sitting by pharisees and teachers of the law,
33357 ^ who were
33359 ^ come out of every village - of galilee, and of judea, and of jerusalem.
33369 ^ and [the] power of [the] lord was [there]
33373 ^ for - to heal him.
33377 ^ and behold,
33379 ^ men
33380 ^ carrying upon a mat a man
33384 ^ who was
33386 ^ paralyzed,
33387 ^ and they were seeking
33389 ^ him to bring in
33391 ^ and to place him before him.
33396 ^ and
33397 ^ not having found
33399 ^ what way they should bring in him on account of the crowd,
33405 ^ having gone up on the housetop, through the tiles they let down him, with the mat into the midst before - jesus.
33423 ^ and
33424 ^ having seen the faith of them, he said,
33429 ^ man, have been forgiven you the sins of you.
33435 ^ and began
33437 ^ to reason the scribes and the pharisees,
33443 ^ saying,
33444 ^ who is this
33447 ^ who speaks blasphemies?
33450 ^ who is able
33452 ^ sins to forgive,
33454 ^ if not alone - god?
33459 ^ having known now - jesus the reasonings of them,
33466 ^ answering, he said to them,
33470 ^ why reason you in the hearts of you?
33476 ^ which is easier,
33479 ^ to say,
33480 ^ have been forgiven you the sins of you,
33485 ^ or to say,
33487 ^ arise
33488 ^ and walk?
33490 ^ that however you may know
33493 ^ that the son - of man authority has on the earth
33503 ^ to forgive sins...
33505 ^ he said
33506 ^ to the [one] having been paralyzed,
33508 ^ to you i say,
33510 ^ arise,
33511 ^ and having taken up the mat of you,
33516 ^ go to the house of you.
33521 ^ and immediately
33523 ^ having stood up before them,
33526 ^ having taken up
33527 ^ [that] on which he was lying, he departed to the home of him,
33535 ^ glorifying - god.
33538 ^ and amazement seized all,
33542 ^ and they were glorifying - god,
33546 ^ and were filled with fear,
33549 ^ saying
33550 ^ -, we have seen remarkable things today.
33554 ^ and after these things he went forth
33558 ^ and he saw a tax collector named levi
33563 ^ sitting at the tax booth;
33567 ^ and he said to him,
33570 ^ follow me.
33572 ^ and
33573 ^ having left all,
33575 ^ having arisen, he began to follow him.
33578 ^ and made a banquet great levi for him in the house of him,
33588 ^ and there was a multitude great of tax collectors and others,
33595 ^ who were with them
33599 ^ reclining.
33600 ^ and were grumbling the pharisees and the scribes of them at the disciples of him,
33612 ^ saying,
33613 ^ because of why with the tax collectors and sinners do you eat
33621 ^ and drink?
33623 ^ and
33624 ^ answering, - jesus said to them,
33630 ^ no need have
33633 ^ those being well
33635 ^ of a physician,
33636 ^ but
33637 ^ those sick
33639 ^ being.
33640 ^ not i have come
33642 ^ to call righteous [ones],
33644 ^ but sinners, to repentance.
33648 ^ - and they said to him,
33653 ^ the disciples of john fast often,
33658 ^ and prayers make,
33661 ^ likewise also those of the pharisees;
33666 ^ those however
33668 ^ of you eat
33670 ^ and drink.
33672 ^ - and
33674 ^ jesus said to them,
33678 ^ not are you able
33680 ^ the sons of the bridechamber
33684 ^ in which [time] the bridegroom with them is, to make
33692 ^ to fast?
33693 ^ will come however days
33696 ^ also when shall be taken away from them the bridegroom;
33703 ^ then they will fast in those - days.
33709 ^ he was speaking now also a parable to them
33715 ^ -: no one
33717 ^ a piece of a garment new having torn, puts [it] on a garment old;
33726 ^ if however otherwise
33729 ^ also the new he will tear,
33733 ^ and the old not will match, which [is] [the] piece - of the new.
33744 ^ and no one puts wine new into wineskins old;
33752 ^ if now otherwise,
33755 ^ will burst the wine - new the wineskins,
33762 ^ and it will be spilled out,
33765 ^ and the wineskins will be destroyed.
33769 ^ but wine new into wineskins fresh must be put.
33776 ^ and no one
33778 ^ having drunk old [wine] desires new;
33782 ^ he says for,
33784 ^ the old better is.
33788 ^ it came to pass then on a sabbath
33792 ^ is passing along he through grainfields,
33796 ^ and were plucking the disciples of him,
33801 ^ and were eating the heads of grain,
33805 ^ rubbing [them] in the hands.
33808 ^ some however
33810 ^ of the pharisees said,
33813 ^ why do you
33815 ^ that which not it is lawful [on] the sabbaths?
33820 ^ and
33821 ^ answering to them, said - jesus,
33827 ^ not even this have you read,
33830 ^ that which did david,
33833 ^ when was hungry he himself,
33836 ^ and those who with him
33840 ^ were:
33841 ^ how he entered into the house - of god,
33848 ^ and
33849 ^ the loaves of the presentation having taken, ate,
33855 ^ and gave to those with him,
33860 ^ which not it is lawful to eat,
33864 ^ if not only to the priests?
33869 ^ and he was saying to them,
33872 ^ lord is
33874 ^ of the sabbath the son - of man.
33880 ^ it came to pass then on another sabbath,
33885 ^ entered he into the synagogue
33890 ^ and taught;
33892 ^ and there was a man there,
33896 ^ and the hand of him the right was withered.
33904 ^ were closely watching now him the scribes and the pharisees,
33912 ^ whether on the sabbath he will heal,
33917 ^ that they might find [reason]
33919 ^ to accuse him.
33921 ^ he now knew the thoughts of them;
33927 ^ he said now to the man
33931 ^ the withered
33933 ^ having
33934 ^ the hand,
33936 ^ arise
33937 ^ and stand in the midst.
33942 ^ and
33943 ^ having risen up, he stood.
33945 ^ said then - jesus to them,
33951 ^ i ask you,
33953 ^ whether it is lawful on the sabbath
33957 ^ to do good
33958 ^ or to do evil?
33960 ^ life to save
33962 ^ or to destroy?
33964 ^ and
33965 ^ having looked around all on them, he said to him,
33970 ^ stretch out the hand of you.
33974 ^ - and he did,
33977 ^ and was restored the hand of him.
33982 ^ they themselves then were filled with rage,
33986 ^ and were discussing with one another
33990 ^ what - they might do - to jesus.
33995 ^ it came to pass then in the days those,
34001 ^ went out he to the mountain
34006 ^ to pray,
34007 ^ and he was
34009 ^ spending the night in - prayer - to god.
34015 ^ and when it became day,
34019 ^ he called to [him] the disciples of him,
34023 ^ also having chosen out from them twelve,
34028 ^ whom also apostles he named:
34032 ^ simon
34033 ^ whom also he named peter, and andrew the brother of him; and james and john; and philip and bartholomew; and matthew and thomas; and james [son of] alphaeus; and simon
34059 ^ the [one] called zealot; and judas [son] of james; and judas iscariot,
34068 ^ who became [the] betrayer.
34071 ^ and
34072 ^ having descended with them, he stood on a place level,
34079 ^ and a crowd large of disciples of him, and a multitude great of the people from all - judea, and jerusalem, and the sea coast of tyre, and sidon,
34101 ^ who came
34103 ^ to hear him
34105 ^ and to be healed of the diseases of them.
34111 ^ and
34112 ^ those troubled with spirits unclean were healed.
34118 ^ and all the multitude were seeking
34123 ^ to touch him,
34125 ^ because power from him was going out
34130 ^ and healing all.
34133 ^ and he,
34135 ^ having lifted up the gaze of him upon the disciples of him, was saying:
34144 ^ blessed [are] the poor,
34147 ^ for yours is the kingdom - of god.
34154 ^ blessed [are]
34155 ^ those hungering now,
34158 ^ for you will be filled.
34160 ^ blessed [are]
34161 ^ those weeping now,
34164 ^ for you will laugh.
34166 ^ blessed are you
34168 ^ when shall hate you - men,
34173 ^ and when they shall exclude you,
34177 ^ and shall insult [you],
34179 ^ and shall cast out the name of you as evil, on account of the son - of man.
34191 ^ rejoice in that - day,
34196 ^ and leap for joy;
34198 ^ behold for,
34200 ^ the reward of you [is] great in - heaven.
34207 ^ according to these things of them for used to treat the prophets the fathers likewise.
34217 ^ but woe to you who are rich,
34222 ^ for you are receiving the comfort of you.
34227 ^ woe to you
34229 ^ who having been filled now,
34232 ^ for you will hunger.
34234 ^ woe to
34235 ^ those laughing now,
34238 ^ for you will mourn
34240 ^ and will weep.
34242 ^ woe to you
34243 ^ when of you well speak all - men,
34250 ^ according to these things of them for used to treat the false prophets the fathers likewise.
34260 ^ but to you i say,
34263 ^ to those hearing:
34265 ^ love the enemies of you,
34269 ^ good do
34271 ^ to those hating you,
34274 ^ bless
34275 ^ those cursing you,
34278 ^ pray
34279 ^ for those mistreating you.
34283 ^ to the [one] striking you on the cheek, offer also the other;
34293 ^ and
34294 ^ from the [one] taking away your - cloak, also the tunic not do withhold.
34305 ^ to everyone asking you, give,
34309 ^ and
34310 ^ from the [one] taking away what [is] yours, not ask [it] back.
34317 ^ and as you desire
34320 ^ that should do to you - men,
34325 ^ do to them likewise.
34328 ^ and if you love
34331 ^ those loving you,
34334 ^ what to you credit is it?
34338 ^ even for - sinners
34342 ^ those loving them, love.
34346 ^ and for if you do good
34350 ^ to those doing good to you,
34353 ^ what to you credit is it?
34357 ^ for even - sinners the same do.
34363 ^ and if you lend [to those]
34366 ^ from whom you expect to receive back,
34370 ^ what to you credit is it?
34374 ^ even sinners to sinners lend,
34378 ^ that they might receive the same amount.
34382 ^ but love the enemies of you,
34387 ^ and do good,
34389 ^ and lend,
34391 ^ nothing expecting in return,
34393 ^ and will be the reward of you great,
34399 ^ and you will be sons of the most high;
34403 ^ for he kind is to the ungrateful and evil.
34412 ^ be you merciful,
34414 ^ as also the father of you merciful is.
34421 ^ and not judge,
34424 ^ that no not you should be judged;
34428 ^ and not condemn,
34431 ^ that no not you should be condemned.
34435 ^ forgive,
34436 ^ and you will be forgiven.
34438 ^ give,
34439 ^ and it will be given to you.
34442 ^ measure good,
34444 ^ pressed down,
34445 ^ shaken together,
34446 ^ running over, will they put into the lap of you,
34452 ^ with that for
34454 ^ measure you measure,
34456 ^ it will be measured again to you.
34458 ^ he spoke then also a parable to them,
34463 ^ not is able a blind [man],
34466 ^ a blind [man] to lead?
34468 ^ not both into a pit will fall?
34473 ^ not is a disciple above the teacher;
34479 ^ fully trained however, everyone will be like the teacher of him.
34487 ^ why now look you at the splinter that [is] in the eye of the brother of you,
34499 ^ - and
34501 ^ the beam that [is] in the own eye not notice?
34509 ^ how are you able
34511 ^ to say to brother of you,
34515 ^ brother, let [that]
34517 ^ i might cast out the splinter that [is] in the eye of you,
34525 ^ yourself the in the eye of you beam not seeing?
34534 ^ hypocrite, cast out first the beam from the eye of you,
34543 ^ and then you will see clearly
34546 ^ the splinter - in the eye of the brother of you to cast out.
34556 ^ no for there is tree good,
34561 ^ producing fruit bad;
34564 ^ nor again a tree bad,
34568 ^ producing fruit good.
34571 ^ each for
34573 ^ tree by the own fruit is known.
34579 ^ not for from thorns do they gather figs,
34585 ^ nor from a bramble bush grapes gather they.
34590 ^ the good man, out of the good treasure of the [his] heart brings forth that which [is] good;
34602 ^ and the evil, out of the evil, brings forth that which [is] evil.
34611 ^ out of for
34613 ^ the abundance of his heart, speaks the mouth of him.
34619 ^ why now me do you call lord, lord,
34625 ^ and not do
34628 ^ what i say?
34630 ^ everyone who is coming to me,
34635 ^ and hearing of me the words,
34640 ^ and doing them,
34643 ^ i will show you
34645 ^ whom he is
34647 ^ like.
34648 ^ like he is
34650 ^ to a man
34651 ^ building a house,
34653 ^ who dug
34655 ^ and deepened,
34657 ^ and laid a foundation on the rock;
34663 ^ a flood then having come,
34666 ^ burst upon the stream the house that,
34672 ^ and not was able
34675 ^ to shake it,
34677 ^ because - well
34680 ^ had been built it.
34682 ^ the [one] however
34684 ^ having heard,
34685 ^ and not having done, like is
34690 ^ to a man
34691 ^ having built a house on the ground without a foundation,
34698 ^ on which burst the stream,
34702 ^ and immediately it fell,
34705 ^ and was the ruin of the house that great.
34713 ^ and when he had completed all the words of him in the hearing of the people,
34724 ^ he entered into capernaum.
34727 ^ of a centurion then
34729 ^ a certain servant,
34731 ^ sick being, was about
34734 ^ to die,
34735 ^ who was to him valued highly.
34739 ^ having heard then about - jesus, he sent to him elders of the jews,
34750 ^ begging him
34752 ^ that
34753 ^ having come, he might save the servant of him.
34758 ^ - and having come to - jesus, they were begging him earnestly,
34767 ^ saying
34768 ^ that, worthy he is,
34771 ^ to whom you will grant this;
34774 ^ he loves for the nation of us,
34779 ^ and the synagogue he built for us.
34785 ^ - and
34787 ^ jesus was going with them.
34791 ^ already then, he not far being distant from the house,
34800 ^ sent friends the centurion,
34804 ^ saying to him,
34806 ^ lord, not trouble yourself,
34809 ^ not for worthy i am
34813 ^ that under the roof of me you should come;
34819 ^ therefore neither myself counted i worthy
34823 ^ to you to come;
34826 ^ but say in a word,
34829 ^ and shall be healed the servant of me.
34834 ^ also for i a man am
34839 ^ under authority appointed,
34842 ^ having under me soldiers;
34846 ^ and i say to this [one],
34849 ^ go,
34850 ^ and he goes;
34852 ^ and to another,
34854 ^ come,
34855 ^ and he comes;
34857 ^ and to [the] servant of me,
34861 ^ do this,
34863 ^ and he does [it].
34865 ^ having heard then these things, - jesus marveled at him;
34872 ^ and
34873 ^ having turned to the
34875 ^ following him crowd, he said,
34879 ^ i say to you,
34881 ^ not even in - israel such great faith did i find.
34888 ^ and
34889 ^ having returned to the house,
34893 ^ those having been sent found the servant
34898 ^ in good health.
34899 ^ and it came to pass on the next [day],
34904 ^ he went into a town
34907 ^ called nain,
34909 ^ and were going with him the disciples of him, and a crowd great.
34918 ^ as then he drew near to the gate of the town,
34925 ^ also behold,
34927 ^ was being carried out
34928 ^ [one] having died, only begotten son of the mother of him;
34934 ^ and she was a widow.
34938 ^ and a crowd of the town, considerable, was with her.
34946 ^ and
34947 ^ having seen her, the lord was moved with compassion on her,
34954 ^ and said to her,
34957 ^ not weep.
34959 ^ and
34960 ^ having come up, he touched the bier;
34964 ^ those then bearing [it] stopped.
34968 ^ and he said,
34970 ^ young man, to you i say,
34973 ^ arise!
34974 ^ and sat up the dead [man],
34978 ^ and began
34980 ^ to speak,
34981 ^ and he gave him to the mother of him.
34987 ^ seized then fear all,
34991 ^ and they began glorifying - god,
34995 ^ saying
34996 ^ -, a prophet great has risen up among us!
35002 ^ and -, has visited - god the people of him!
35010 ^ and went out the report this in all - judea concerning him,
35021 ^ and in all the surrounding region.
35025 ^ and brought word to john the disciples of him concerning all these things.
35034 ^ and
35035 ^ having called near two certain - disciples of him, - john sent [them] to the lord,
35047 ^ saying,
35048 ^ you are
35050 ^ the coming [one],
35052 ^ or another are we to look for?
35055 ^ having come then to him, the men said,
35062 ^ john the baptist has sent us to you,
35069 ^ saying,
35070 ^ you are
35072 ^ the coming [one],
35074 ^ or another are we to look for?
35077 ^ at that very - hour, he healed many of diseases, and afflictions, and spirits evil,
35090 ^ and to blind many he granted
35094 ^ to see.
35095 ^ and
35096 ^ answering, he said to them,
35099 ^ having gone, relate to john
35102 ^ what you have seen
35104 ^ and heard:
35106 ^ blind receive sight,
35108 ^ lame walk,
35110 ^ lepers are cleansed,
35112 ^ and deaf hear,
35115 ^ dead are raised,
35117 ^ poor are gospelized.
35119 ^ and blessed is
35122 ^ who if not shall be offended in me.
35128 ^ having departed then the messengers of john,
35133 ^ he began
35134 ^ to speak to the crowds concerning john:
35140 ^ what have you gone out into the wilderness to see?
35146 ^ a reed
35147 ^ by [the] wind shaken?
35150 ^ but
35151 ^ what have you gone out to see?
35154 ^ a man
35155 ^ in fine clothing arrayed?
35159 ^ behold,
35160 ^ those in clothing splendid and in luxury
35166 ^ living, in the palaces are.
35171 ^ but
35172 ^ what have you gone out to see?
35175 ^ a prophet?
35176 ^ yes,
35177 ^ i say to you,
35179 ^ and [one] more excellent than a prophet.
35182 ^ this is he
35184 ^ concerning whom it has been written:
35187 ^ behold,
35188 ^ i send the messenger of me before [the] face of you,
35195 ^ who will prepare the way of you before you.’
35202 ^ i say to you,
35204 ^ a greater among [those] born of women
35208 ^ than john no one is;
35211 ^ - yet
35213 ^ the least in the kingdom of god, greater than he is.
35222 ^ and all the people
35226 ^ having heard,
35227 ^ even the tax collectors, declared as righteous - god,
35233 ^ having been baptized [with] the baptism of john;
35237 ^ - but
35239 ^ the pharisees and the lawyers, the counsel - of god rejected as to themselves,
35250 ^ not having been baptized by him.
35254 ^ to what therefore will i liken the men of the generation this?
35262 ^ and to what are they
35265 ^ like?
35266 ^ like are they
35268 ^ to little children
35269 ^ - in the marketplace
35272 ^ sitting,
35273 ^ and calling to each other
35276 ^ one, saying:
35278 ^ we piped to you,
35280 ^ and not you did dance;
35283 ^ we sang a dirge,
35284 ^ and not you did weep.
35287 ^ has come for john the baptist,
35292 ^ neither eating bread,
35295 ^ nor drinking wine,
35298 ^ and you say,
35300 ^ a demon he has.
35302 ^ has come the son - of man,
35307 ^ eating
35308 ^ and drinking,
35310 ^ and you say,
35312 ^ behold,
35313 ^ a man, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and of sinners.
35321 ^ and was justified - wisdom by all the children of her.
35330 ^ was asking now one him
35334 ^ of the pharisees,
35336 ^ that he should eat with him;
35340 ^ and
35341 ^ having entered into the house of the pharisee, he reclined.
35348 ^ and behold,
35350 ^ a woman
35351 ^ who was in the city, a sinner.
35357 ^ and
35358 ^ she having known
35359 ^ that he had reclined in the house of the pharisee,
35366 ^ having taken an alabaster flask of fragrant oil,
35369 ^ and having stood behind him at the feet of him
35376 ^ weeping,
35377 ^ the tears she began to wet with the feet of him,
35384 ^ and with the hairs of the head of her, she was wiping [them],
35391 ^ and was kissing the feet of him,
35396 ^ and was anointing [them] with the fragrant oil.
35400 ^ having seen now the pharisee,
35404 ^ the [one] having invited him, he spoke within himself,
35410 ^ saying,
35411 ^ this,
35412 ^ if he were a prophet,
35415 ^ would have known -
35417 ^ who and what the woman [is]
35422 ^ who touches him,
35425 ^ for a sinner she is.
35428 ^ and
35429 ^ answering, - jesus said to him,
35435 ^ simon, i have
35437 ^ to you something to say.
35440 ^ - and,
35442 ^ teacher, say [it],
35444 ^ he says.
35445 ^ two debtors there were to a creditor certain;
35450 ^ the one owed denarii five hundred;
35455 ^ - and
35457 ^ the other, fifty.
35459 ^ nothing having they
35462 ^ to pay,
35463 ^ both he forgave.
35465 ^ which therefore
35467 ^ of them, more will love him?
35471 ^ answering, simon said,
35474 ^ i take it
35475 ^ that
35476 ^ [he] to whom the most he forgave.
35480 ^ - and he said to him,
35484 ^ rightly you have judged.
35486 ^ and
35487 ^ having turned to the woman, - to simon he was saying,
35494 ^ see you this the woman?
35498 ^ i entered of you into the house,
35503 ^ water of me for feet not you gave;
35509 ^ with her however - tears she wet my - feet,
35517 ^ and with [the] hair of her wiped [them].
35522 ^ a kiss to me not you gave;
35526 ^ she herself however,
35528 ^ from which [time] i came in, not has ceased
35533 ^ kissing my - feet.
35537 ^ with oil the head of me not you did anoint;
35543 ^ she herself however, with fragrant oil anointed the feet of me.
35550 ^ this therefore i say to you,
35554 ^ have been forgiven the sins of her - many,
35560 ^ for she loved much;
35563 ^ to whom however little is forgiven, little he loves.
35569 ^ he said then to her,
35572 ^ have been forgiven your - sins.
35576 ^ and began
35578 ^ those reclining
35580 ^ to say within themselves,
35583 ^ who this is
35586 ^ who even sins forgives?
35590 ^ he said then to the woman,
35595 ^ the faith of you has saved you;
35600 ^ go in peace.
35603 ^ and it came to pass afterward - soon,
35608 ^ that he was traveling throughout city and village,
35615 ^ preaching
35616 ^ and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom - of god.
35622 ^ and the twelve [were] with him,
35627 ^ and women certain
35630 ^ who had been
35632 ^ cured from spirits evil and infirmities: mary
35639 ^ who is called magdalene,
35642 ^ from whom demons seven had gone out; and joanna wife of chuza, a steward of herod, and susanna, and others many,
35658 ^ who were ministering to them
35661 ^ out of the means their own.
35665 ^ [as] is assembling now a crowd great,
35669 ^ and those from each town
35673 ^ are coming to him,
35676 ^ he spoke by a parable:
35679 ^ went out
35680 ^ the [one] sowing
35682 ^ - to sow the seed of him.
35687 ^ and
35688 ^ in the sowing of him, some indeed fell along the road,
35698 ^ and it was trampled upon,
35700 ^ and the birds of the air devoured it.
35707 ^ and other fell upon the rock,
35713 ^ and
35714 ^ having sprung up it withered
35716 ^ through - no
35719 ^ having moisture.
35721 ^ and other fell in [the] midst of the thorns,
35728 ^ and
35729 ^ having sprung up with [it], the thorns choked it.
35734 ^ and other fell upon the soil - good,
35742 ^ and
35743 ^ having sprung up, it produced fruit a hundredfold.
35747 ^ these things saying, he was calling out,
35750 ^ the [one] having ears
35753 ^ to hear, let him hear.
35755 ^ were asking then him the disciples of him,
35761 ^ what this means,
35764 ^ the parable?
35766 ^ - and he said,
35769 ^ to you it has been given
35771 ^ to know the mysteries of the kingdom - of god;
35778 ^ to however
35780 ^ [the] rest, [it is] in parables,
35783 ^ so that,
35784 ^ seeing, not may they see;
35787 ^ and
35788 ^ hearing, not may they understand.’
35791 ^ is now this the parable:
35796 ^ the seed is the word - of god.
35803 ^ those now
35805 ^ along the road are
35809 ^ those having heard;
35811 ^ then comes the devil
35815 ^ and takes away the word from the heart of them,
35823 ^ that not
35825 ^ having believed they should be saved.
35827 ^ those now
35829 ^ upon the rock,
35832 ^ those who when they hear,
35835 ^ with joy receive the word,
35840 ^ and these a root not have,
35845 ^ who for a time believe,
35849 ^ and in time of testing fall away.
35854 ^ that now into the thorns
35859 ^ having fallen,
35860 ^ these are
35862 ^ those having heard,
35864 ^ and under cares, and riches, and pleasures - of life,
35873 ^ moving along are choked,
35875 ^ and not do mature.
35878 ^ that now
35880 ^ in the good soil,
35884 ^ these are
35886 ^ those in a heart worthy and good,
35892 ^ having heard the word keep [it],
35896 ^ and bring forth fruit by perseverance.
35900 ^ no one now
35902 ^ a lamp having lighted, covers it with a vessel,
35907 ^ or under a bed puts [it],
35911 ^ but on a lampstand puts [it],
35915 ^ so that
35916 ^ those entering in may see the light.
35921 ^ nothing for is hidden
35925 ^ which not manifest will become,
35929 ^ nor secret
35931 ^ which nothing not shall be known,
35935 ^ and to light come.
35939 ^ take heed therefore
35941 ^ how you hear;
35943 ^ whoever - for might have,
35947 ^ will be given to him;
35949 ^ and whoever - not might have,
35954 ^ even
35955 ^ what he seems to have will be taken away from him.
35961 ^ came then to him the mother and the brothers of him,
35971 ^ and not they were able
35974 ^ to get to him, because of the crowd.
35979 ^ it was told also him,
35982 ^ the mother of you and the brothers of you are standing outside,
35991 ^ to see wanting you.
35994 ^ - but
35996 ^ answering, he said to them,
36000 ^ mother of me and brothers of me,
36005 ^ those are
36007 ^ who the word - of god
36012 ^ are hearing
36013 ^ and doing.
36015 ^ it came to pass then, on one of the days
36021 ^ also he entered into a boat
36026 ^ with the disciples of him,
36030 ^ and he said to them,
36034 ^ let us pass over to the other side of the lake.
36040 ^ and they launched out.
36042 ^ sailing then of them,
36045 ^ he fell asleep.
36046 ^ and came down a storm of wind on the lake,
36053 ^ and they were being swamped
36055 ^ and were in danger.
36057 ^ having come to [him] then, they awoke him,
36061 ^ saying,
36062 ^ master, master, we are perishing!
36065 ^ - and
36067 ^ having arisen, he rebuked the wind and the raging of the water,
36076 ^ and they ceased,
36078 ^ and there was a calm.
36081 ^ he said then to them,
36084 ^ where is the faith of you?
36088 ^ having been afraid then, they marveled,
36091 ^ saying to one another,
36094 ^ who then this is,
36098 ^ that even the winds he commands
36103 ^ and the water,
36106 ^ and they obey him?
36109 ^ and they sailed down to the region of the gerasenes,
36116 ^ which is opposite - galilee.
36121 ^ having gone forth then he upon the land,
36127 ^ met [him] a man certain out of the city,
36133 ^ having demons,
36135 ^ and time a long not was wearing clothing,
36141 ^ and in a house not did abide,
36146 ^ but in the tombs.
36150 ^ having seen then - jesus,
36154 ^ having cried out, he fell down before him,
36157 ^ and in a voice loud said,
36161 ^ what to me and to you, jesus, son - of god, the most high?
36171 ^ i implore of you
36173 ^ not me you might torment!
36176 ^ he was commanding for the spirit - unclean
36182 ^ to come out from the man.
36186 ^ many for
36188 ^ times it had seized him,
36191 ^ and he was bound, with chains and shackles
36196 ^ being kept;
36197 ^ and breaking the chains,
36201 ^ he was driven by the demon into the deserts.
36208 ^ asked now him - jesus,
36213 ^ what your name is?
36217 ^ - and he said,
36220 ^ legion,
36221 ^ because were entered demons many into him.
36227 ^ and they were begging him,
36230 ^ that not he would command them
36234 ^ into the abyss to go away.
36238 ^ there was now there a herd of pigs many
36244 ^ feeding, in the mountain,
36248 ^ and they begged him
36251 ^ that he would allow them
36254 ^ into them to enter;
36257 ^ and he allowed them.
36260 ^ having gone out then the demons from the man, they entered into the pigs,
36271 ^ and rushed the herd down the steep bank into the lake
36281 ^ and was drowned.
36283 ^ having seen then
36285 ^ those feeding [them]
36287 ^ that having taken place, they fled
36290 ^ and reported [it] to the city and to the country.
36299 ^ they went out then
36301 ^ to see
36302 ^ that having taken place,
36304 ^ and they came to - jesus
36309 ^ and found
36311 ^ sitting the man
36314 ^ from whom the demons had gone out,
36319 ^ clothed
36320 ^ and being of sound mind, at the feet - of jesus.
36327 ^ and they were afraid.
36329 ^ related then to them
36332 ^ those having seen [it],
36334 ^ how was healed the [one] having been possessed by demons.
36338 ^ and asked him all the multitude of the surrounding region of the gerasenes
36348 ^ to depart from them,
36351 ^ because with fear great they were seized.
36355 ^ he now,
36357 ^ having entered into the boat, turned back.
36361 ^ was begging however him the man
36366 ^ from whom had gone the demons
36371 ^ to be [taken] with him.
36374 ^ he sent away however him
36377 ^ saying,
36378 ^ return to the house of you,
36383 ^ and relate
36385 ^ all that for you has done - god.
36390 ^ and he departed,
36392 ^ through all the city proclaiming
36397 ^ all that had done for him - jesus.
36402 ^ when then - returned - jesus, received him the crowd;
36412 ^ they were for all
36415 ^ looking for him.
36417 ^ and behold,
36419 ^ came a man
36421 ^ whose name [was] jairus,
36424 ^ and he a ruler of the synagogue was,
36430 ^ and
36431 ^ having fallen at the feet - of jesus, he began begging him
36439 ^ to come to the house of him,
36444 ^ because daughter an only was to him,
36449 ^ about years [old] twelve,
36452 ^ and she was dying.
36455 ^ as then - went he, the crowds were pressing around him.
36464 ^ and a woman
36466 ^ being with a flux of blood for years twelve,
36473 ^ who on physicians having spent all her living,
36479 ^ neither was able
36481 ^ by no one to be healed,
36484 ^ having come behind, touched the fringe the of cloak of him,
36492 ^ and immediately stopped the flux of the blood of her.
36500 ^ and said - jesus,
36504 ^ who [is]
36505 ^ the [one] having touched me?
36508 ^ were denying [it] however all;
36511 ^ said - peter,
36514 ^ master, the people surround you
36519 ^ and press in.
36521 ^ - but
36523 ^ jesus said,
36525 ^ touched me someone;
36528 ^ i for know
36531 ^ power has gone out from me.
36535 ^ having seen then the woman
36539 ^ that not she was hid,
36542 ^ trembling she came,
36544 ^ and
36545 ^ having fallen down before him,
36547 ^ for what cause she touched him she declared before all the people,
36557 ^ and how she was healed immediately.
36561 ^ - and he said to her,
36565 ^ daughter, the faith of you has healed you;
36571 ^ go in peace.
36574 ^ still of him speaking,
36577 ^ comes one from the synagogue ruler,
36582 ^ saying
36583 ^ -, has died the daughter of you;
36588 ^ no longer trouble the teacher.
36592 ^ - but
36594 ^ jesus
36595 ^ having heard, answered him,
36598 ^ not fear;
36600 ^ only believe,
36602 ^ and she will be saved.
36604 ^ having entered then into the house, not he did allow
36611 ^ to go in anyone with him,
36615 ^ if not
36617 ^ peter, and john, and james, and the father of the child, and the mother.
36630 ^ they were weeping now all
36633 ^ and mourning for her.
36636 ^ - but he said,
36639 ^ not weep;
36641 ^ not for she is dead,
36644 ^ but sleeps.
36646 ^ and they were laughing at him,
36649 ^ knowing
36650 ^ that she was dead.
36652 ^ he now,
36654 ^ having taken hold of the hand of her, called out,
36659 ^ saying
36660 ^ -, child, arise!
36663 ^ and returned the spirit of her,
36668 ^ and she arose immediately;
36671 ^ and he directed to her
36674 ^ to be given
36675 ^ to eat.
36676 ^ and were amazed the parents of her;
36681 ^ - and he instructed them
36685 ^ no one to tell
36687 ^ what had happened.
36689 ^ having called together then the twelve, he gave to them power and authority over all the demons,
36702 ^ and diseases to heal,
36705 ^ and he sent them
36708 ^ to proclaim the kingdom - of god
36713 ^ and to heal the sick,
36717 ^ and he said to them,
36721 ^ nothing take for the journey;
36726 ^ neither staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money, nor apiece two tunics to have.
36739 ^ and into whatever -
36743 ^ house you might enter,
36745 ^ there remain,
36747 ^ and from there go forth.
36750 ^ and as many as - not might receive you,
36756 ^ going forth from the city that, the dust from the feet of you shake off, as a testimony against them.
36772 ^ going forth then, they were passing through the villages,
36778 ^ proclaiming the gospel
36779 ^ and healing everywhere.
36782 ^ heard of now herod the tetrarch
36787 ^ the things being done all,
36790 ^ and was perplexed,
36792 ^ because - it was said by some
36797 ^ - john has been raised out from [the] dead,
36802 ^ by some also
36805 ^ that elijah had appeared,
36808 ^ by others also
36810 ^ that a prophet one of the ancients had arisen.
36816 ^ said then herod,
36819 ^ john i beheaded;
36822 ^ who however is this
36826 ^ concerning whom i hear such things?
36830 ^ and he was seeking
36832 ^ to see him.
36834 ^ and
36835 ^ having returned, the apostles related to him
36840 ^ whatever they had done.
36842 ^ and
36843 ^ having taken them, he withdrew by himself into a town
36850 ^ called bethsaida.
36852 ^ the now
36854 ^ crowds
36855 ^ having known [it], followed him;
36858 ^ and
36859 ^ having received them, he was speaking to them concerning the kingdom - of god,
36868 ^ and
36869 ^ those need
36871 ^ having
36872 ^ of healing, he was healing.
36874 ^ - and
36876 ^ the day began
36878 ^ to decline;
36879 ^ having come then the twelve said to him,
36885 ^ dismiss the crowd,
36888 ^ that
36889 ^ having gone into the surrounding villages and countryside they might lodge,
36897 ^ and might find provisions;
36900 ^ for here in a desolate place we are.
36906 ^ he said now to them,
36910 ^ give to them you.
36913 ^ to eat
36914 ^ - but they said,
36917 ^ not there are to us more than loaves five, and fish two,
36927 ^ if not
36929 ^ having gone, we should buy for all the people this food.
36938 ^ they were for about men five thousand.
36943 ^ he said then to the disciples of him,
36949 ^ make sit down them, groups of about in fifty.
36955 ^ and they did so
36958 ^ and made sit down all.
36961 ^ having taken then the five loaves and the two fish,
36970 ^ having looked up to the heaven, he blessed them
36976 ^ and broke [them],
36978 ^ and he kept giving [them] to the disciples
36982 ^ to set before the crowd.
36985 ^ and they ate
36987 ^ and were satisfied all;
36990 ^ and was taken up
36992 ^ that having been a surplus to them of fragments, hand-baskets twelve.
36998 ^ and it came to pass
37000 ^ as - was he
37004 ^ praying in solitary,
37007 ^ were with him the disciples,
37011 ^ and he questioned them,
37014 ^ saying,
37015 ^ whom me do pronounce the crowds to be?
37021 ^ - and
37023 ^ answering, they said,
37025 ^ john the baptist;
37028 ^ others also,
37030 ^ elijah;
37031 ^ others now,
37033 ^ that a prophet, one of the ancients, has arisen.
37039 ^ he said then to them,
37042 ^ you however,
37044 ^ whom me do pronounce to be?
37048 ^ peter then
37050 ^ answering said,
37052 ^ the christ - of god.
37056 ^ - and
37058 ^ having strictly warned them, he instructed [them]
37061 ^ to no one to tell this,
37064 ^ having said
37065 ^ -, it is necessary for
37067 ^ the son - of man many things to suffer,
37073 ^ and to be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes,
37082 ^ and to be killed,
37084 ^ and on the third day to be raised.
37089 ^ he was saying then to all,
37093 ^ if anyone desires
37096 ^ after me to come,
37099 ^ let him deny himself,
37101 ^ and let him take up the cross of him every day,
37108 ^ and let him follow me.
37111 ^ whoever for - might desire
37115 ^ the life of him to save, will lose it;
37121 ^ whoever however - might lose the life of him on account of me,
37130 ^ he will save it.
37133 ^ what for is profited a man,
37137 ^ having gained the world whole,
37141 ^ himself now having destroyed,
37144 ^ or having suffered the loss of?
37146 ^ whoever for - may have been ashamed of me and - my words,
37155 ^ him the son - of man will be ashamed of
37161 ^ when he shall come in the glory of himself, and of the father, and of the holy angels.
37174 ^ i say now to you
37177 ^ truthfully, there are some
37180 ^ of those here
37182 ^ standing,
37183 ^ who no not shall taste of death
37188 ^ until - they shall have seen the kingdom - of god.
37195 ^ it came to pass now after the sayings these, about days eight,
37204 ^ and
37205 ^ having taken peter and john and james, he went up on the mountain
37215 ^ to pray.
37216 ^ and it came to pass
37218 ^ in the praying of him,
37222 ^ the appearance of the face of him [was] altered,
37228 ^ and the clothing of him white
37233 ^ became dazzling.
37234 ^ and behold,
37236 ^ men two began talking with him,
37240 ^ who were moses and elijah.
37245 ^ those
37246 ^ having appeared in glory were speaking of the going out of him,
37253 ^ which he was about to accomplish in jerusalem.
37258 ^ - and
37260 ^ peter and those with him were
37266 ^ heavy with sleep;
37268 ^ having awoken fully then they saw the glory of him, and the two men
37278 ^ - standing with him.
37281 ^ and it came to pass
37283 ^ in the departing of them from him,
37289 ^ said - peter to - jesus,
37295 ^ master, good it is
37298 ^ for us here to be;
37301 ^ also let us make tabernacles three: one for you, and one for moses, and one for elijah,
37313 ^ not knowing
37315 ^ what he is saying.
37317 ^ these things then as he is saying,
37321 ^ came a cloud
37323 ^ and was overshadowing them;
37326 ^ they feared then
37328 ^ in the entering of them into the cloud.
37335 ^ and a voice came out of the cloud,
37341 ^ saying,
37342 ^ this is the son of me,
37347 ^ - whom i have chosen;
37349 ^ him listen to!
37351 ^ and
37352 ^ as - occurred the voice, was found jesus alone.
37360 ^ and they were silent,
37363 ^ and to no one they told in those the days anything
37371 ^ of what they had seen.
37373 ^ it came to pass then the next day,
37378 ^ on having come down of them from the mountain,
37383 ^ met him a crowd great.
37387 ^ and behold,
37389 ^ a man from the crowd cried out,
37394 ^ saying,
37395 ^ teacher, i implore you
37398 ^ to look upon the son of me,
37403 ^ for an only child to me he is.
37407 ^ and behold,
37409 ^ a spirit takes him,
37412 ^ and suddenly he cries out,
37415 ^ and it throws into convulsions him with foaming,
37420 ^ and with difficulty it departs from him,
37425 ^ bruising him.
37427 ^ and i begged the disciples of you
37432 ^ that they might cast out it,
37435 ^ and not they were able.
37438 ^ answering now, - jesus said,
37443 ^ o generation unbelieving
37446 ^ and perverted, until when will i be with you
37453 ^ and bear with you?
37456 ^ bring here the son of you.
37461 ^ while then he was coming near of him,
37465 ^ threw down him the demon
37469 ^ and threw [him] into convulsions.
37471 ^ rebuked then - jesus the spirit - unclean,
37479 ^ and healed the boy,
37483 ^ and gave back him to father of him.
37489 ^ were astonished then all at the majesty - of god.
37497 ^ of all however wondering at all
37502 ^ which he did,
37504 ^ he said to the disciples of him,
37509 ^ let sink you into the ears of you the words these;
37518 ^ - for
37520 ^ the son - of man is about
37524 ^ to be betrayed into [the] hands of men.
37528 ^ - but they understand not the saying this,
37534 ^ and it was
37536 ^ veiled from them,
37539 ^ that not they should understand it.
37543 ^ and they were afraid
37545 ^ to ask him concerning the saying this.
37551 ^ came up then an argument among them,
37556 ^ this, who -
37559 ^ might be greatest of them.
37562 ^ - but
37564 ^ jesus,
37565 ^ having known the reasoning of the heart of them,
37571 ^ having taken hold of a child, set it by him,
37577 ^ and he said to them,
37580 ^ whoever if shall receive this - child in the name of me, me receives;
37592 ^ and
37593 ^ whoever - me shall receive, receives
37598 ^ the [one] having sent me.
37601 ^ the [one] for least among all you being,
37608 ^ he shall be great.
37611 ^ answering now, john said,
37615 ^ master, we saw someone
37618 ^ in the name of you casting out demons,
37624 ^ and we were forbidding him,
37627 ^ because not he follows with us.
37632 ^ said then to him - jesus,
37638 ^ not forbid;
37640 ^ whoever for not is against you, for you is.
37649 ^ it came to pass then
37651 ^ in the completing the days of the ascension of him,
37659 ^ that he the face steadfastly set
37664 ^ - to go to jerusalem.
37668 ^ and he sent messengers before [the] face of him.
37674 ^ and
37675 ^ having gone, they entered into a village of the samaritans,
37680 ^ so as to make ready for him.
37683 ^ and not they did receive him,
37687 ^ because the face of him was [as]
37692 ^ going toward jerusalem.
37695 ^ having seen [it] now, the disciples james and john said,
37703 ^ lord, will you [that]
37705 ^ we should call
37706 ^ fire to come down from - heaven
37711 ^ and to consume them?”
37714 ^ having turned then, he rebuked them.
37718 ^ and they went to another village.
37723 ^ and going of them along the road,
37729 ^ said someone to him,
37733 ^ i will follow you
37735 ^ wherever if you may go.
37738 ^ and said to him - jesus,
37743 ^ the foxes holes have,
37747 ^ and the birds of the air nests;
37753 ^ - but
37755 ^ the son - of man not has
37760 ^ where the head he might lay.
37764 ^ he said then to another,
37768 ^ follow me.
37770 ^ - but he said,
37773 ^ lord allow me
37776 ^ having gone away, first, to bury the father of me.
37782 ^ he said then to him,
37785 ^ leave the dead
37788 ^ to bury - their own dead;
37792 ^ you however,
37794 ^ having gone forth, declare the kingdom - of god.
37800 ^ said then also another,
37804 ^ i will follow you, lord;
37807 ^ first however allow me
37811 ^ to bid farewell to those at the home of me.
37817 ^ said then to him - jesus,
37823 ^ no one
37824 ^ having laid the hand upon [the] plow,
37829 ^ and looking on the things behind, fit is
37836 ^ for the kingdom - of god.
37840 ^ after now
37842 ^ these things, appointed the lord others seventy two
37849 ^ and sent them in two [by] two before [the] face of himself into every city and place
37863 ^ where was about he himself
37866 ^ to go.
37867 ^ he was saying then to them,
37871 ^ the indeed
37873 ^ harvest [is] plentiful,
37875 ^ - but
37877 ^ the workmen [are] few.
37879 ^ pray earnestly to therefore the lord of the harvest,
37885 ^ that workmen he may send out into the harvest of him.
37892 ^ go;
37893 ^ behold,
37894 ^ i send forth you
37896 ^ as lambs in [the] midst of wolves.
37901 ^ neither carry purse,
37904 ^ nor bag,
37906 ^ nor sandals;
37908 ^ and no one on the road greet.
37914 ^ into whatever now - you might enter
37919 ^ house,
37920 ^ first say
37922 ^ peace to the house this.
37926 ^ and if there is a son of peace,
37932 ^ will rest upon him the peace of you;
37938 ^ if however not so,
37941 ^ to you it will return.
37944 ^ in the same now
37947 ^ - house remain,
37950 ^ eating
37951 ^ and drinking the things [supplied] by them;
37956 ^ worthy [is] for the workman
37960 ^ of the wages of him.
37963 ^ not move from house to house.
37969 ^ and into whatever -
37973 ^ city you might enter,
37975 ^ and they receive you,
37978 ^ eat
37979 ^ the things set before you.
37982 ^ and heal - in it [the] sick,
37988 ^ and say to them,
37991 ^ has drawn near to you the kingdom - of god.
37998 ^ into whatever now -
38002 ^ city you might enter,
38004 ^ and not they receive you,
38008 ^ having gone out into the streets of it, say,
38014 ^ even the dust
38017 ^ - having clung to us out of the city of you to the feet, we wipe off against you;
38029 ^ yet this know,
38032 ^ that has drawn near the kingdom - of god.
38038 ^ i say to you
38040 ^ that for sodom in the day that,
38046 ^ more tolerable it will be
38048 ^ than the city for that.
38052 ^ woe to you, chorazin!
38055 ^ woe to you, bethsaida!
38058 ^ for if in tyre and sidon had taken place the miracles
38067 ^ - having taken place in you,
38071 ^ long ago - in sackcloth and ashes sitting, they would have repented.
38079 ^ but for tyre and sidon, more tolerable will it be in the judgment
38088 ^ than for you.
38090 ^ and you, capernaum,
38093 ^ not to heaven will you be lifted up;
38097 ^ to - hades you will be brought down.
38101 ^ the [one] hearing you, me hears;
38106 ^ and
38107 ^ the [one] rejecting you, me rejects;
38112 ^ the [one] now me rejecting, rejects
38117 ^ the [one] having sent me.
38120 ^ returned then the seventy two with joy,
38127 ^ saying,
38128 ^ lord, even the demons are subject to us through the name of you.
38138 ^ he said then to them,
38141 ^ i beheld - satan
38144 ^ as lightning out of the heaven having fallen.
38150 ^ behold,
38151 ^ i give you the authority
38155 ^ - to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and upon all the power of the enemy,
38168 ^ and nothing you no not will injure.
38174 ^ yet in this not rejoice,
38179 ^ that the spirits to you are subjected;
38184 ^ rejoice however
38186 ^ that the names of you are written in the heavens.
38194 ^ in the same - hour, he rejoiced in the spirit - holy
38204 ^ and said,
38206 ^ i fully consent to you, father, lord of the heaven and of the earth,
38215 ^ that you have hidden these things from wise and intelligent,
38222 ^ and have revealed them to little children;
38226 ^ yes, - father,
38229 ^ for thus well-pleasing was it before you.
38235 ^ all things to me have been delivered by the father of me.
38242 ^ and no one knows
38245 ^ who is the son,
38249 ^ if not the father;
38253 ^ and
38254 ^ who is the father,
38258 ^ if not the son,
38262 ^ and
38263 ^ to whom if might resolve the son to reveal [him].
38269 ^ and
38270 ^ having turned to the disciples in private, he said,
38277 ^ blessed [are] the eyes
38280 ^ - seeing
38282 ^ what you see!
38284 ^ i say for to you
38287 ^ that many prophets and kings desired
38293 ^ to see
38294 ^ what you see,
38297 ^ and not saw;
38300 ^ and
38301 ^ to hear
38302 ^ what you hear,
38304 ^ and not heard.
38307 ^ and behold,
38309 ^ a lawyer certain stood up,
38312 ^ testing him,
38314 ^ saying,
38315 ^ teacher,
38316 ^ what having done, life eternal will i inherit?
38321 ^ - and he said to him,
38326 ^ in the law what has been written?
38331 ^ how read you?
38333 ^ - and
38335 ^ answering, he said,
38337 ^ you shall love [the] lord the god of you with all the heart of you, and with all the soul of you, and with all the strength of you, and with all the mind of you’
38365 ^ and the neighbor of you
38369 ^ as yourself.’
38371 ^ he said then to him,
38374 ^ correctly you have answered.
38376 ^ this do,
38378 ^ and you will live.
38380 ^ - but
38382 ^ desiring
38383 ^ to justify himself, he said to - jesus,
38389 ^ and who is my neighbor?
38394 ^ having taken [it] up, - jesus said,
38398 ^ a man certain was going down from jerusalem to jericho,
38405 ^ and robbers fell among,
38408 ^ who
38409 ^ both having stripped him,
38412 ^ and wounds having inflicted, went away,
38416 ^ having left [him] half dead.
38418 ^ by chance now a priest certain was going down on the road that,
38428 ^ and
38429 ^ having seen him he passed by on the opposite side.
38432 ^ likewise now also a levite
38436 ^ having come to the spot,
38440 ^ having come
38441 ^ and having seen [him], passed by on the opposite side.
38444 ^ a samaritan however,
38446 ^ one
38447 ^ journeying, came to him,
38451 ^ and
38452 ^ having seen was moved with compassion,
38454 ^ and
38455 ^ having approached, he bound up the wounds of him,
38460 ^ pouring on oil and wine;
38464 ^ having put then him on the own beast, he brought him to an inn
38475 ^ and took care of him.
38478 ^ and on the next day,
38482 ^ having taken out he gave [them] two denarii, to the innkeeper
38488 ^ and said,
38490 ^ take care of him,
38492 ^ and
38493 ^ whatever more - you might expend, of me
38498 ^ on - returning, i will repay you.
38504 ^ which of these - three a neighbor seems to you to have been
38512 ^ of the [one] having fallen among the robbers?
38517 ^ - and he said,
38520 ^ the [one] having shown - compassion toward him.
38526 ^ said then to him - jesus,
38531 ^ go
38532 ^ and you do likewise.
38536 ^ in now the proceeding of them, he entered into a village certain;
38546 ^ a woman now
38548 ^ certain named martha received him.
38553 ^ and she had
38556 ^ a sister
38557 ^ called mary,
38559 ^ who
38560 ^ also having sat down at the feet of the lord, was listening to the word of him.
38571 ^ - but
38573 ^ martha was distracted about much service;
38578 ^ having come up now, she said,
38581 ^ lord, not is it concerning to you
38585 ^ that the sister of me
38589 ^ alone me has left to serve?
38593 ^ speak therefore to her
38596 ^ that me she might help!
38599 ^ answering now, said to her the lord,
38605 ^ martha, martha, you are anxious
38608 ^ and troubled about many things;
38612 ^ one [thing] however is
38615 ^ necessary,
38616 ^ mary for the good portion has chosen,
38622 ^ which not will be taken away from her.
38626 ^ and it came to pass
38628 ^ in - being his in a place certain
38635 ^ praying,
38636 ^ when he ceased,
38638 ^ said one of the disciples of him to him,
38645 ^ lord, teach us
38648 ^ to pray,
38649 ^ as also john taught the disciples of him.
38656 ^ he said then to them,
38659 ^ when you pray,
38661 ^ say:
38662 ^ father, hallowed be the name of you.
38667 ^ come the kingdom of you.
38671 ^ the bread of us - daily give us
38678 ^ - each day.
38681 ^ and forgive us the sins of us,
38687 ^ also for ourselves we forgive
38691 ^ everyone indebted to us;
38694 ^ and not lead us into temptation.’”
38700 ^ and he said to them,
38704 ^ who among you will have a friend,
38709 ^ and will go to him at midnight
38714 ^ and say to him,
38717 ^ friend, lend me three loaves,
38722 ^ since a friend of my is come off a journey to me,
38730 ^ and nothing i have
38733 ^ what i will set before him.
38736 ^ and he
38737 ^ from within answering will say,
38740 ^ not me trouble cause;
38744 ^ already the door has been shut,
38748 ^ and the children of me with me in the bed are;
38758 ^ not i am able
38760 ^ having risen up, to give to you.
38763 ^ i say to you,
38765 ^ if even not he will give to him,
38770 ^ having risen up,
38771 ^ because of - being friend of him,
38776 ^ because of yet
38778 ^ the persistence of him,
38781 ^ having risen he will give him
38784 ^ as much as he needs.
38786 ^ and i to you say,
38789 ^ ask
38790 ^ and it will be given to you;
38793 ^ seek
38794 ^ and you will find;
38796 ^ knock
38797 ^ and it will be opened to you.
38800 ^ everyone for - asking receives;
38805 ^ and
38806 ^ the [one] seeking finds;
38809 ^ and
38810 ^ to the [one] knocking, it will be opened.
38813 ^ which now
38815 ^ of you who [is] a father, will ask for the son a fish,
38823 ^ and instead of a fish, a serpent to him will he give?
38829 ^ or also [if] he will ask for an egg,
38833 ^ will he give to him a scorpion?
38836 ^ if therefore you,
38839 ^ evil being, know
38842 ^ gifts good to give to the children of you,
38848 ^ how much more the father who [is] in heaven will give [the] spirit holy
38858 ^ to those asking him!
38861 ^ and he was
38863 ^ casting out a demon,
38865 ^ and it was mute;
38869 ^ it came to pass then
38871 ^ the demon having gone out,
38874 ^ spoke the mute [man].
38877 ^ and marveled the crowds.
38881 ^ some then
38883 ^ of them said,
38886 ^ by beelzebul the prince of the demons he casts out the demons.
38895 ^ others now,
38897 ^ testing, a sign from heaven were seeking from him.
38904 ^ he now,
38906 ^ knowing their - thoughts, said to them,
38912 ^ every kingdom
38914 ^ against itself having been divided is brought to desolation;
38918 ^ and a house against a house falls.
38923 ^ if now also - satan against himself is divided,
38931 ^ how will stand the kingdom of him?
38936 ^ for you say,
38938 ^ by beelzebul cast out i the demons.
38944 ^ if now i by beelzebul cast out the demons,
38952 ^ the sons of you, by whom do they cast out?
38958 ^ on account of this, they of you judges will be.
38964 ^ if however by [the] finger of god i cast out the demons,
38973 ^ then has come upon you the kingdom - of god.
38981 ^ when the strong [man]
38984 ^ being armed might guard - his house,
38989 ^ in peace are
38992 ^ the possessions of him;
38995 ^ when however [one] stronger than he,
38999 ^ having come upon [him], shall overcome him,
39002 ^ the complete armor of him he takes away
39006 ^ in which he had trusted,
39009 ^ and the plunder of him he divides.
39014 ^ the [one] not
39016 ^ being with me against me is;
39022 ^ and
39023 ^ the [one] not
39025 ^ gathering with me scatters.
39029 ^ when the unclean spirit is gone out from the man,
39037 ^ it passes through waterless places
39041 ^ seeking rest;
39043 ^ and
39044 ^ not finding [any], then it says,
39048 ^ i will return to the house of me,
39053 ^ from where i came out.
39055 ^ and
39056 ^ having come, it finds [it]
39058 ^ swept
39059 ^ and put in order.
39061 ^ then it goes
39063 ^ and takes other spirits more evil than itself, seven,
39070 ^ and
39071 ^ having entered, they dwell there;
39074 ^ and becomes the last of the man that worse than the first.
39084 ^ it came to pass then,
39086 ^ in - saying his these things,
39091 ^ having lifted up one [her] voice,
39094 ^ a woman from the crowd said to him,
39100 ^ blessed [is] the womb
39103 ^ - having borne you, and [the] breasts
39108 ^ at which you nursed.
39110 ^ he then said,
39113 ^ no rather, blessed [are]
39115 ^ those hearing the word - of god
39121 ^ and keeping it.
39123 ^ of the now
39125 ^ crowds being pressed around together,
39127 ^ he began
39128 ^ to say,
39129 ^ the generation this, generation an evil is;
39135 ^ a sign it seeks after,
39137 ^ and a sign not will be given to it,
39142 ^ if not the sign of jonah.
39147 ^ as for was jonah to the ninevites a sign,
39154 ^ thus will be also the son - of man to the generation this.
39164 ^ the queen of [the] south will rise up in the judgment with the men of the generation this,
39176 ^ and will condemn them.
39179 ^ for she came from the ends of the earth
39186 ^ to hear the wisdom of solomon,
39190 ^ and behold,
39192 ^ greater than solomon here.
39195 ^ [the] men of nineveh will stand up in the judgment with the generation this,
39205 ^ and will condemn it.
39208 ^ for they repented at the preaching of jonah,
39214 ^ and behold,
39216 ^ greater than jonah [is] here.
39219 ^ but no one
39220 ^ a lamp having lit, in secret sets it,
39225 ^ nor under the basket,
39229 ^ but upon the lampstand,
39233 ^ that
39234 ^ those entering in the light may see.
39239 ^ the lamp of your body is the eye of you.
39247 ^ when the eye of you clear is,
39253 ^ also all the body of you light is;
39260 ^ when however evil it be,
39264 ^ also the body of you [is] dark.
39269 ^ take heed therefore,
39271 ^ lest the light that [is] in you darkness be.
39279 ^ if therefore the body of you [is] full of light,
39286 ^ not having part any dark,
39291 ^ it will be light all,
39294 ^ as when the lamp - shining might light you.
39302 ^ in then the speaking, asked him a pharisee
39309 ^ that he would dine with him,
39313 ^ having entered then, he reclined.
39316 ^ - and
39318 ^ the pharisee,
39319 ^ having seen [it], marveled
39321 ^ that not first he washed before the dinner.
39328 ^ said then the lord to him,
39334 ^ now you - pharisees, the outside of the cup and of the dish you cleanse,
39346 ^ - and
39348 ^ the inside of you is full of plundering and wickedness.
39354 ^ fools! [did] not
39356 ^ the [one] having made the outside, also the inside make?
39364 ^ but [of]
39365 ^ the things being within give alms,
39369 ^ and behold,
39371 ^ all things clean to you are.
39375 ^ but woe to you - pharisees,
39380 ^ for you pay tithes of - mint and - rue and every herb;
39390 ^ and you pass by the justice and the love - of god.
39399 ^ these things also it behooved [you] to do,
39403 ^ and those not to neglect.
39406 ^ woe to you - pharisees,
39410 ^ for you love the first seat in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces.
39423 ^ woe to you,
39425 ^ for you are like - graves - unmarked,
39432 ^ and the men
39435 ^ - walking above not have known [it].
39440 ^ answering now, one of the lawyers says to him,
39447 ^ teacher,
39448 ^ these things saying, also us you insult.
39453 ^ - and he said,
39456 ^ also to you the lawyers, woe!
39461 ^ for you burden the men [with] burdens heavy to bear,
39467 ^ and yourselves with one of the fingers of you, not do touch the burdens.
39477 ^ woe to you,
39479 ^ for you build the tombs of the prophets,
39485 ^ - yet
39487 ^ the fathers of you killed them.
39491 ^ so witnesses you are,
39494 ^ and consent to the works of the fathers of you.
39501 ^ for they indeed killed them;
39506 ^ you now build [their tombs].
39509 ^ because of this also the wisdom - of god said,
39517 ^ i will send to them prophets and apostles,
39523 ^ and [some] of them they will kill
39527 ^ and persecute,
39529 ^ so that might be charged the blood of all the prophets
39536 ^ - having been poured out from [the] foundation of [the] world against the generation this, from the blood of abel to the blood of zechariah,
39551 ^ the [one] having perished between the altar and the house.
39559 ^ yes, i say to you,
39562 ^ it will be required of the generation this.
39567 ^ woe to you, the lawyers,
39571 ^ for you have taken away the key of the knowledge.
39577 ^ you yourselves not did enter,
39580 ^ and
39581 ^ those who are entering you hindered.
39584 ^ from there having gone forth of him,
39587 ^ began the scribes and the pharisees
39593 ^ urgently to press upon [him]
39595 ^ and to make speak him about many things,
39600 ^ watching him
39602 ^ to catch in something out of the mouth of him.
39608 ^ in these [times], having been gathered together the myriads of the crowd
39615 ^ so as to trample upon one another,
39618 ^ he began
39619 ^ to say to the disciples of him
39624 ^ first, take heed to yourselves of the leaven,
39630 ^ which is hypocrisy, of the pharisees.
39635 ^ nothing now
39637 ^ concealed up is,
39639 ^ which not will be revealed,
39642 ^ nor hidden
39644 ^ which not will be known.
39647 ^ instead, that
39649 ^ whatever in the darkness you have said, in the light will be heard;
39658 ^ and
39659 ^ what into the ear you have spoken in the inner rooms will be proclaimed upon the housetops.
39671 ^ i say now to you, those friends of me,
39677 ^ not you should fear
39679 ^ because of those killing the body
39684 ^ and after these things not being able
39689 ^ more abundantly anything to do.
39692 ^ i will show however you
39695 ^ whom you should fear:
39697 ^ fear
39698 ^ the [one who]
39699 ^ after the killing,
39702 ^ has authority
39704 ^ to cast into - hell.
39708 ^ yes, i say to you,
39711 ^ him fear.
39713 ^ not five sparrows are sold for assarion two?
39719 ^ and one of them not is
39725 ^ forgotten before - god.
39729 ^ but even the hairs of the head of you all have been numbered.
39738 ^ not fear,
39740 ^ than many sparrows you are more valuable.
39743 ^ i say now to you,
39746 ^ everyone who - will confess in me before the men,
39755 ^ also the son - of man will confess in him before the angels - of god;
39768 ^ the [one] now having denied me before - men, will be denied before the angels - of god.
39781 ^ and everyone who will speak a word against the son - of man,
39791 ^ it will be forgiven him;
39793 ^ the [one] however against the holy spirit having blasphemed, not will be forgiven.
39802 ^ when then they bring you before the synagogues, and the rulers, and the authorities,
39815 ^ not be anxious
39817 ^ how
39818 ^ or what you shall reply in defense,
39821 ^ or what you should say;
39824 ^ the for
39826 ^ holy spirit will teach you in same the hour
39834 ^ what it behooves [you] to say.
39837 ^ said then one from the crowd to him,
39844 ^ teacher, say to the brother of me
39849 ^ to divide with me the inheritance.
39854 ^ - and he said to him,
39858 ^ man, who me appointed a judge or partitioner over you?
39867 ^ he said then to them,
39871 ^ beware
39872 ^ and keep yourselves from all covetousness;
39877 ^ for not
39879 ^ in the abundance to anyone, the life to him is
39887 ^ of that which possesses of him.
39891 ^ he spoke then a parable to them,
39896 ^ saying,
39897 ^ of a man certain rich brought forth abundantly
39901 ^ the ground.
39903 ^ and he was reasoning within himself,
39907 ^ saying,
39908 ^ what shall i do,
39910 ^ for not i have
39913 ^ where i will store up the fruits of me?
39918 ^ and he said,
39920 ^ this will i do:
39922 ^ i will tear down my - barns
39926 ^ and greater will build,
39929 ^ and will store up there all the grain and the goods of me.
39939 ^ and i will say to the soul of me,
39944 ^ soul, you have many good things
39948 ^ laid up for years many;
39952 ^ take your rest;
39953 ^ eat,
39954 ^ drink,
39955 ^ be merry.
39956 ^ said then to him - god,
39961 ^ fool! this - night, the soul of you is required of you;
39971 ^ what now you did prepare — to whom will [it] be?
39976 ^ so [is]
39977 ^ the [one] treasuring up for himself,
39980 ^ and not toward god being rich.
39985 ^ he said then to the disciples of him,
39991 ^ because of this i say to you,
39995 ^ not be anxious for the life,
39999 ^ what you should eat,
40001 ^ nor for the body
40004 ^ what you should put on.
40006 ^ the for
40008 ^ life more than is
40011 ^ the food,
40013 ^ and the body than the clothing.
40018 ^ consider the ravens,
40021 ^ that not they sow
40024 ^ nor reap;
40026 ^ to them not there is a storehouse
40030 ^ nor barn —
40032 ^ and - god feeds them.
40037 ^ how much more you are valuable than the birds!
40043 ^ which now
40045 ^ of you,
40047 ^ being anxious, is able
40049 ^ to the lifespan of him to add one hour?
40055 ^ if then not even
40058 ^ [the] least you are able [to do],
40060 ^ why about the rest are you anxious?
40065 ^ consider the lilies,
40068 ^ how they grow:
40070 ^ not do they labor,
40072 ^ nor do they spin.
40074 ^ i say however to you,
40077 ^ not even solomon in all the glory of him was arrayed
40085 ^ as one of these.
40088 ^ if however in [the] field the grass,
40094 ^ being [here] today
40096 ^ and tomorrow into the furnace being thrown, - god thus clothes,
40105 ^ how much more you, o [you] of little faith!
40109 ^ and you not seek
40113 ^ what you might eat,
40115 ^ and what you might drink,
40118 ^ and not be in suspense;
40121 ^ these things for
40123 ^ all the nations of the world seek after;
40129 ^ of you now
40131 ^ the father knows
40134 ^ that you have need of these.
40137 ^ but seek you the kingdom of him,
40142 ^ and these things will be added to you.
40146 ^ not fear, - little flock,
40151 ^ for took delight the father of you
40156 ^ to give you the kingdom.
40160 ^ sell
40161 ^ the possessions of you
40164 ^ and give alms;
40167 ^ make to yourselves purses
40170 ^ not growing old, a treasure unfailing in the heavens,
40177 ^ where thief not does draw near,
40181 ^ nor moth destroy.
40184 ^ where for is the treasure of you,
40190 ^ there also the heart of you will be.
40196 ^ let be your - waist
40200 ^ girded about,
40201 ^ and the lamps
40204 ^ burning;
40205 ^ and you, like to men
40209 ^ waiting for the master of themselves,
40213 ^ whenever he shall return from the wedding feasts,
40218 ^ that having come
40220 ^ and having knocked,
40222 ^ immediately they might open to him.
40225 ^ blessed [are] the servants those,
40229 ^ whom
40230 ^ having come, the master will find
40234 ^ watching.
40235 ^ truly i say to you
40238 ^ that he will gird himself
40240 ^ and will make recline them,
40243 ^ and
40244 ^ having come up, will serve them.
40247 ^ and if in the second and if in the third watch he comes
40257 ^ and finds [them] thus,
40260 ^ blessed are those!
40263 ^ this however know,
40266 ^ that if had known the master of the house
40271 ^ in what hour the thief is coming,
40276 ^ not - he would have allowed
40279 ^ to be broken into the house of him.
40283 ^ also you be ready;
40287 ^ for
40288 ^ in the hour not you expect, the son - of man comes.
40297 ^ said then - peter,
40301 ^ lord, to us the parable this speak you,
40308 ^ or also to all?
40312 ^ and said the lord,
40316 ^ who then is the faithful manager [and] the wise,
40324 ^ whom will set the master over the care [of servants] of him,
40332 ^ - to give [them] in season the measure of food?
40338 ^ blessed [is] the servant that
40342 ^ whom
40343 ^ having come, the master of him will find
40348 ^ doing thus.
40350 ^ of a truth i say to you
40353 ^ that
40354 ^ over all the possessions of him he will set him.
40361 ^ if however should say the servant that in the heart of him,
40371 ^ delays the master of me
40375 ^ to come,
40376 ^ and should begin
40378 ^ to beat the men-servants and the maid-servants,
40384 ^ to eat also
40386 ^ and to drink
40388 ^ and to get drunk,
40390 ^ will come the master of the servant that in a day
40398 ^ in which not he does expect, and in an hour
40404 ^ that not he knows,
40407 ^ and he will cut in two him
40410 ^ and the place of him with the unbelievers will appoint.
40418 ^ that now
40420 ^ - servant,
40422 ^ the [one] having known the will of the master of him
40429 ^ and not having prepared,
40432 ^ nor having done according to the will of him, will be beaten with many [blows];
40440 ^ the [one] however
40442 ^ not having known,
40444 ^ having done however [things] worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few.
40450 ^ everyone now
40452 ^ to whom has been given much,
40455 ^ much will be required from him;
40459 ^ and to whom has been committed much,
40463 ^ the more will they ask of him.
40466 ^ fire i came to cast upon the earth,
40472 ^ and how i wish
40475 ^ if already it be kindled!
40478 ^ baptism however i have
40481 ^ to be baptized [with],
40482 ^ and how i am distressed
40485 ^ until while it should be accomplished!
40488 ^ think you
40489 ^ that
40490 ^ peace i came to give on the earth?
40496 ^ no,
40497 ^ i say to you,
40499 ^ but rather division.
40502 ^ there will be for from - now five in one house
40511 ^ divided,
40512 ^ three against two,
40515 ^ and two against three.
40519 ^ they will be divided father against son
40523 ^ and son against father,
40527 ^ mother against - daughter
40531 ^ and daughter against - mother,
40536 ^ mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law of her
40541 ^ and daughter-in-law against - mother-in-law.
40546 ^ he was saying now also to the crowds,
40551 ^ when you see a cloud
40555 ^ rising up from [the] west,
40558 ^ immediately you say
40560 ^ -, a shower is coming,
40563 ^ and it happens so.
40566 ^ and when a south wind
40569 ^ is blowing,
40570 ^ you say
40571 ^ -, heat there will be,
40574 ^ and it happens.
40576 ^ hypocrites!
40577 ^ the appearance of the earth and of the sky you know [how] to discern;
40586 ^ the time however this, how not do you know
40593 ^ to discern?
40594 ^ why now even for yourselves not judge you what [is] right?
40603 ^ as for you are going with the adversary of you before a magistrate, in the way
40615 ^ give earnestness
40617 ^ to be set free from him,
40620 ^ lest ever he should drag away you to the judge,
40626 ^ and the judge you will deliver to the officer,
40633 ^ and the officer you will cast into prison.
40640 ^ i say to you,
40642 ^ no not shall you come out from there
40646 ^ until even the last lepton you shall have paid.”
40652 ^ were present now some at the same - time,
40659 ^ telling him about the galileans
40664 ^ of whom the blood pilate had mingled with the sacrifices of them.
40673 ^ and
40674 ^ answering, he said to them,
40677 ^ think you
40678 ^ that - galileans these, sinners beyond all the galileans were,
40688 ^ because such things they have suffered?
40691 ^ no,
40692 ^ i say to you;
40694 ^ but if not you repent,
40698 ^ all likewise you will perish.
40701 ^ or those - ten [and] eight
40705 ^ on whom fell the tower in - siloam
40713 ^ and killed them,
40716 ^ think you
40717 ^ that these debtors were beyond all the men
40725 ^ - dwelling in jerusalem?
40728 ^ no,
40729 ^ i say to you;
40731 ^ but if not you repent,
40735 ^ all likewise you will perish.
40738 ^ he was speaking then this - parable:
40743 ^ a fig tree had a certain [man]
40746 ^ planted in the vineyard of him;
40751 ^ and he came
40753 ^ seeking fruit on it,
40757 ^ and not did find [any].
40760 ^ he said then to the vinedresser,
40765 ^ behold,
40766 ^ three years
40768 ^ throughout these i come
40771 ^ seeking fruit on the fig tree this,
40777 ^ and not do find [any].
40780 ^ cut down therefore it,
40783 ^ that why even the ground should it use up?
40788 ^ - and
40790 ^ answering, he says to him,
40793 ^ sir, let alone it also this the year,
40800 ^ until when i shall dig around it,
40805 ^ and put [in] manure,
40808 ^ and if indeed it should bear fruit
40812 ^ in the [time], so be it.
40815 ^ if however not,
40818 ^ you will cut down it.
40820 ^ he was now
40822 ^ teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbaths.
40830 ^ and behold,
40832 ^ a woman
40833 ^ a spirit having
40835 ^ of infirmity, years ten [and] eight.
40838 ^ and she was
40840 ^ bent over
40841 ^ and not able
40844 ^ to lift up herself to the full.
40848 ^ having seen then her, - jesus called [her] near
40854 ^ and said to her,
40857 ^ woman, you have been freed from the sickness of you.
40862 ^ and he laid upon her the hands,
40867 ^ and immediately she was made straight
40870 ^ and began to glorify - god.
40874 ^ answering now the ruler of the synagogue,
40878 ^ indignant
40879 ^ because on the sabbath had healed - jesus, he was saying to the crowd
40888 ^ -, six days there are
40892 ^ in which it behooves to work;
40896 ^ in these therefore coming be healed,
40901 ^ and not on the day of the sabbath.
40907 ^ answered therefore him the lord
40912 ^ and said,
40914 ^ hypocrites! each one of you on the sabbath, not does he untie the ox of him, or the donkey, from the stall,
40930 ^ and
40931 ^ having led [it] away, give [it] to drink?
40933 ^ this now,
40935 ^ a daughter of abraham being,
40938 ^ whom has bound - satan,
40942 ^ behold, ten and eight years,
40947 ^ not ought [she]
40949 ^ to be loosed from the bond this on the day of the sabbath?
40958 ^ and these things on saying of him,
40962 ^ were ashamed
40963 ^ all those opposed to him;
40967 ^ and all the crowd was rejoicing at all the glorious things
40976 ^ that were being done by him.
40980 ^ he was saying then,
40982 ^ to what like is the kingdom - of god?
40989 ^ and to what shall i liken it?
40993 ^ like it is
40995 ^ to a grain of mustard,
40997 ^ which having taken, a man cast into garden his;
41004 ^ and it grew
41006 ^ and came into a tree,
41010 ^ and the birds of the air encamped in the branches of it.
41020 ^ and again he said,
41023 ^ to what shall i liken the kingdom - of god?
41029 ^ like it is
41031 ^ to leaven,
41032 ^ which having taken, a woman hid in of meal measures three
41040 ^ until it was leavened all.
41044 ^ and he was going through by towns and villages,
41050 ^ teaching,
41051 ^ and progress making toward jerusalem.
41056 ^ said then one to him,
41060 ^ lord, if [are] few
41063 ^ those being saved?
41065 ^ - and he said to them,
41070 ^ strive
41071 ^ to enter in through the narrow door;
41076 ^ for many,
41078 ^ i say to you, will seek
41081 ^ to enter in,
41082 ^ and not will be able.
41085 ^ from what - shall have risen up the master of the house,
41091 ^ and shall have shut the door,
41095 ^ then you should begin
41097 ^ outside to stand
41099 ^ and to knock at the door,
41103 ^ saying,
41104 ^ lord, open to us.
41107 ^ and
41108 ^ he answering, will say to you,
41111 ^ not i do know you,
41114 ^ from where are.
41116 ^ then will you begin
41118 ^ to say,
41119 ^ we ate in presence of you
41122 ^ and drank,
41124 ^ and in the streets of us you taught.
41130 ^ and he will say,
41132 ^ i tell you,
41134 ^ not i do know you
41137 ^ from where you are;
41139 ^ depart from me, all [you] workers of unrighteousness.
41145 ^ there will be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth
41154 ^ when you see abraham, and isaac, and jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom - of god; you however
41172 ^ are being cast out.
41174 ^ and they will come from east and west, and from north and south,
41185 ^ and will recline in the kingdom - of god.
41192 ^ and behold,
41194 ^ there are last
41196 ^ who will be first,
41199 ^ and there are first
41202 ^ who will be last.
41205 ^ in same the hour came near certain pharisees,
41212 ^ saying to him,
41214 ^ go out
41215 ^ and proceed from here,
41218 ^ for herod desires
41221 ^ you to kill.
41223 ^ and he said to them,
41226 ^ having gone, say to the fox that,
41231 ^ behold,
41232 ^ i cast out demons,
41234 ^ and cures i complete today and tomorrow,
41240 ^ and the third [day] i am perfected.
41244 ^ but it behooves
41246 ^ me today and tomorrow
41250 ^ and the [day] following to proceed;
41254 ^ for not it is possible [for]
41257 ^ a prophet to perish outside of jerusalem.
41261 ^ jerusalem, jerusalem,
41263 ^ - killing the prophets,
41267 ^ and stoning
41269 ^ those having been sent to her, how often i have wanted
41275 ^ to gather those children of you,
41279 ^ that way a hen [gathers] - her brood under the wings,
41288 ^ and not you were willing.
41291 ^ behold,
41292 ^ is left to you the house of you.
41297 ^ i say now to you,
41300 ^ no not shall you see me
41304 ^ until [the time] comes
41306 ^ when you say,
41308 ^ blessed is
41309 ^ the [one] coming in [the] name of [the] lord.’
41314 ^ and it came to pass
41316 ^ on the going of him into a house of one of the rulers of the pharisees on a sabbath
41328 ^ to eat bread,
41330 ^ and they were
41333 ^ watching him.
41335 ^ and behold,
41337 ^ a man certain there was
41340 ^ with dropsy before him.
41343 ^ and
41344 ^ answering, - jesus spoke to the lawyers and to [the] pharisees,
41353 ^ saying,
41354 ^ is it lawful on the sabbath
41357 ^ to heal
41358 ^ or not?
41360 ^ - but they were silent.
41363 ^ and
41364 ^ having taken hold [of him], he healed him
41367 ^ and let [him] go.
41369 ^ and to them he said,
41373 ^ which of you a son or an ox into a pit will fall,
41381 ^ also not immediately he will pull up him on day the sabbath?
41390 ^ and not they were able
41393 ^ to reply to these things.
41396 ^ he was speaking then
41398 ^ to those having been invited a parable,
41402 ^ remarking
41403 ^ how the first places they were choosing out,
41407 ^ saying to them,
41410 ^ when you are invited by anyone to wedding feasts,
41416 ^ not do recline in the first place,
41421 ^ lest ever [one] more honorable than you might have been
41425 ^ invited by him,
41428 ^ and
41429 ^ having come,
41430 ^ the [one] you and him
41434 ^ having invited will say to you,
41437 ^ give to this one [your] place,
41440 ^ and then you should begin
41443 ^ with shame the last place to take.
41449 ^ but when you are invited,
41452 ^ having gone, recline in the last place,
41458 ^ so that when might come
41461 ^ the [one] having invited you,
41464 ^ he will say to you,
41466 ^ friend, come up higher.
41469 ^ then will be to you glory
41473 ^ before all those reclining [with] you.
41478 ^ for
41479 ^ everyone - exalting himself will be humbled,
41484 ^ and
41485 ^ the [one] humbling himself will be exalted.
41489 ^ he was saying then also
41492 ^ to the [one] having invited him,
41495 ^ when you make a dinner or a supper,
41500 ^ not call - friends of you, nor the brothers of you, nor the relatives of you, nor neighbors rich,
41516 ^ lest ever also they should invite in return you,
41521 ^ and be made recompense to you.
41525 ^ but when a feast you make,
41529 ^ call the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind;
41534 ^ and blessed you will be,
41537 ^ because nothing they have
41540 ^ to repay you.
41542 ^ it will be recompensed for to you in the resurrection of the righteous.
41550 ^ having heard then one
41553 ^ of those reclining with [him]
41555 ^ these things, he said to him,
41558 ^ blessed [is he]
41559 ^ who will eat bread in the kingdom - of god.
41567 ^ - but he said to him,
41571 ^ a man certain was preparing a supper great,
41576 ^ and invited many.
41579 ^ and he sent the servant of him at the hour of the supper
41588 ^ to say
41589 ^ to those having been invited,
41591 ^ come,
41592 ^ for now ready [it] is.
41596 ^ and began with one [voice] all
41601 ^ to excuse themselves.
41602 ^ the first said to him,
41606 ^ a field i have bought,
41608 ^ and i have need
41611 ^ going out to see it;
41614 ^ i beg of you,
41616 ^ hold me
41618 ^ excused.
41619 ^ and another said,
41622 ^ yoke of oxen i have bought
41625 ^ five,
41626 ^ and i am going
41628 ^ to prove them;
41630 ^ i beg of you
41632 ^ hold me
41634 ^ excused.
41635 ^ and another said,
41638 ^ a wife i have married,
41640 ^ and because of this not i am able
41645 ^ to come.
41646 ^ and
41647 ^ having come, the servant reported to the master of him these things.
41655 ^ then
41656 ^ having become angry, the master of the house said to servant of him,
41663 ^ go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city,
41672 ^ and the poor and crippled and blind and lame bring in here.
41683 ^ and said the servant,
41687 ^ sir, it has been done
41689 ^ as you did command,
41691 ^ and still room there is.
41695 ^ and said the master to the servant,
41702 ^ go out into the highways and hedges
41708 ^ and compel [them]
41710 ^ to come in,
41711 ^ so that may be filled of me the house.
41716 ^ i say for to you
41719 ^ that not one the men of those
41724 ^ - having been invited will taste of me the supper.
41730 ^ were going with then him crowds great;
41735 ^ and
41736 ^ having turned, he said to them,
41740 ^ if anyone comes to me,
41745 ^ and not hates the father of himself and the mother and the wife and the children and the brothers and the sisters, yes, and even the life of him,
41772 ^ not he is able
41774 ^ to be of me disciple.
41777 ^ whoever not carries the cross of himself
41783 ^ and comes after me, not is able
41789 ^ to be my disciple.
41792 ^ which for
41794 ^ of you,
41796 ^ desiring
41797 ^ a tower to build, not first
41801 ^ having sat down, counts the cost,
41805 ^ whether he has for [its] completion?
41809 ^ thus not ever he having laid of it a foundation,
41814 ^ and not being able
41817 ^ to finish,
41818 ^ all - seeing [it] may begin
41822 ^ him to mock,
41824 ^ saying
41825 ^ -, this - man began
41830 ^ to build
41831 ^ and not was able
41834 ^ to finish.
41835 ^ or what king,
41838 ^ proceeding with another king
41841 ^ to engage in war, not,
41845 ^ having sat down, first will take counsel
41848 ^ whether able he is
41851 ^ with ten thousand to meet
41855 ^ the [one] with twenty thousand
41859 ^ coming against him?
41862 ^ if now not,
41865 ^ still of him far off being,
41869 ^ an embassy having sent, he asks - for peace.
41875 ^ so therefore every one of you
41880 ^ who not does give up
41883 ^ all that he himself possesses, not is able
41889 ^ to be my disciple.
41892 ^ good [is] therefore the salt;
41896 ^ if however even the salt becomes tasteless,
41902 ^ with what will it be seasoned?
41905 ^ neither for soil nor for manure fit is it;
41913 ^ out they cast it.
41916 ^ the [one] having ears
41919 ^ to hear, let him hear.
41921 ^ were now
41923 ^ to him drawing near all the tax collectors and the sinners
41931 ^ to hear him.
41933 ^ and were grumbling the both pharisees and the scribes,
41941 ^ saying
41942 ^ -, this [man] sinners receives
41946 ^ and eats with them.
41949 ^ he spoke then to them the parable this,
41956 ^ saying,
41957 ^ what man of you,
41961 ^ having a hundred sheep,
41964 ^ and having lost of them one, not leaves the ninety nine in the open field,
41977 ^ and goes
41979 ^ after the [one] having been lost,
41982 ^ until he finds it?
41985 ^ and
41986 ^ having found [it], he lays [it] on the shoulders of him,
41992 ^ rejoicing.
41993 ^ and
41994 ^ having come to the house, he calls together the friends and the neighbors,
42004 ^ saying to them,
42006 ^ rejoice with me,
42008 ^ for i have found the sheep of me,
42013 ^ the [one] having been lost!
42015 ^ i say to you
42017 ^ that in the same way joy in - heaven there will be over one sinner
42027 ^ repenting, rather than over ninety nine righteous ones,
42033 ^ who no need have
42037 ^ of repentance.
42038 ^ or what woman,
42041 ^ drachmas having
42043 ^ ten,
42044 ^ if she should lose drachma one,
42048 ^ not lights a lamp
42051 ^ and sweeps the house,
42055 ^ and seeks carefully
42058 ^ until it she finds?
42061 ^ and
42062 ^ having found [it], she calls together the friends and neighbors,
42068 ^ saying,
42069 ^ rejoice with me,
42071 ^ for i have found the drachma
42075 ^ that i lost.
42077 ^ thus
42078 ^ i say to you, there is joy before the angels - of god over one sinner
42090 ^ repenting.
42091 ^ he said then,
42093 ^ a man certain had two sons.
42098 ^ and said the younger of them to [the] father,
42105 ^ father, give to me the
42109 ^ falling [to me] portion of the property.
42113 ^ - and he divided between them the property.
42119 ^ and after not many days,
42124 ^ having gathered together all, the younger son went away into a country distant,
42133 ^ and there he wasted the estate of him,
42139 ^ living prodigally.
42141 ^ having spent however of him all,
42145 ^ there arose a famine severe throughout the country that,
42152 ^ and he began
42155 ^ to be in need.
42156 ^ and
42157 ^ having gone, he joined himself to one of the citizens the country of that,
42165 ^ and he sent him into the fields of him
42172 ^ to feed pigs.
42174 ^ and he was longing
42176 ^ to be filled from the pods
42180 ^ that were eating the pigs;
42184 ^ and no one was giving to him.
42188 ^ to himself however having come, he was saying,
42193 ^ how many hired servants of the father of me have abundance of bread,
42200 ^ i however with hunger here am perishing?
42205 ^ having risen up, i will go to the father of me,
42211 ^ and i will say to him,
42214 ^ father, i have sinned against - heaven and before you;
42222 ^ no longer am i worthy
42225 ^ to be called son of you.
42228 ^ make me like one of the servants of you.
42235 ^ and
42236 ^ having risen up, he went to the father of himself.
42242 ^ still now he far being distant,
42247 ^ saw him the father of him,
42252 ^ and was moved with compassion,
42254 ^ and
42255 ^ having run, fell upon the neck of him
42261 ^ and kissed him.
42264 ^ said then the son to him,
42269 ^ father, i have sinned against - heaven and before you;
42277 ^ no longer am i worthy
42280 ^ to be called son of you.
42283 ^ said then the father to the servants of him,
42291 ^ quickly bring out robe the best
42296 ^ and clothe him,
42299 ^ and give a ring for the hand of him,
42306 ^ and sandals for his feet;
42311 ^ and having brought the calf - fattened,
42317 ^ kill [it],
42318 ^ and
42319 ^ having eaten, let us be merry.
42321 ^ for this - son of mine dead was,
42328 ^ and is alive again;
42330 ^ he was
42331 ^ lost,
42332 ^ and is found.
42334 ^ and they began
42336 ^ to be merry.
42337 ^ was now the son of him, the elder, in [the] field;
42346 ^ and while
42348 ^ coming [up], he drew near to the house,
42352 ^ he heard music and dancing.
42356 ^ and
42357 ^ having called near one of the servants, he began inquiring
42362 ^ what - might be these things.
42366 ^ - and he said to him
42370 ^ -, the brother of you is come,
42375 ^ and has killed the father of you the calf - fattened,
42384 ^ because
42385 ^ in good health him he has received.
42388 ^ he was angry however,
42390 ^ and not was willing
42393 ^ to go in.
42394 ^ - and
42396 ^ the father of him,
42398 ^ having gone, was begging him.
42401 ^ - and
42403 ^ answering, he said to [the] father of him,
42408 ^ behold,
42409 ^ so many years i serve you,
42413 ^ and never a commandment of you i disobeyed,
42418 ^ and to me never did you give a young goat,
42423 ^ that with the friends of me i might make merry.
42429 ^ when however the son of you this,
42435 ^ the [one] having devoured your - living with prostitutes, came,
42443 ^ you have killed for him the fattened calf!
42448 ^ - and he said to him,
42452 ^ son, you always with me are,
42458 ^ and all that [is] mine, yours is.
42464 ^ to make merry however
42466 ^ and to rejoice it was fitting,
42469 ^ because the brother of you this, dead was,
42476 ^ and is alive again;
42478 ^ and
42479 ^ he was lost,
42480 ^ and is found.
42482 ^ he was saying now also to the disciples,
42488 ^ a man certain there was rich,
42492 ^ who had a manager,
42495 ^ and he was accused unto him
42499 ^ as is wasting
42501 ^ the possessions of him.
42504 ^ and
42505 ^ having called him, he said to him,
42509 ^ what [is]
42510 ^ this i hear concerning you?
42514 ^ give the account of the stewardship of you;
42520 ^ not for you are able
42523 ^ any longer to manage.
42525 ^ said then within himself the manager,
42531 ^ what shall i do,
42533 ^ for the master of me is taking away the management from me?
42542 ^ to dig not i am able;
42545 ^ to beg i am ashamed.
42547 ^ i know
42548 ^ what i will do
42550 ^ so that when i shall have been removed from the management,
42556 ^ they might receive me into the homes of them.
42562 ^ and
42563 ^ having called to [him] one each of the debtors of the master of him, he was saying to the first,
42574 ^ how much owe you to master of me?
42579 ^ - and he said,
42582 ^ a hundred baths of oil.
42585 ^ - and he said to him,
42589 ^ take your the bill
42593 ^ and,
42594 ^ having sat down quickly, write fifty.
42598 ^ then to another he said,
42601 ^ you now how much owe?
42605 ^ - and he said,
42608 ^ a hundred cors of wheat.
42611 ^ he says to him,
42613 ^ take your - bill
42617 ^ and write eighty.
42620 ^ and praised the master the manager - unrighteous,
42628 ^ because shrewdly he had acted.
42631 ^ for the sons of the age this more shrewd than the sons of the light in the generation - of themselves are.
42649 ^ and i to you say,
42653 ^ for yourselves make friends by the wealth - of unrighteousness,
42661 ^ that when it fails
42664 ^ they might receive you into the eternal dwellings.
42670 ^ the [one] faithful with very little, also with much faithful is;
42679 ^ and the [one] with very little unrighteous, also with much unrighteous is.
42689 ^ if therefore in the unrighteous wealth, faithful not you have been,
42698 ^ the true [riches] who to you will entrust?
42703 ^ and if in that which [is] of another, faithful not you have been,
42711 ^ that which [is] yours who to you? will give
42716 ^ no servant is able
42719 ^ two masters to serve;
42722 ^ either for the one he will hate,
42727 ^ and the other he will love;
42731 ^ or one he will be devoted to,
42734 ^ and the other he will despise.
42738 ^ not you are able
42740 ^ god to serve
42742 ^ and money.
42744 ^ were listening to now these things all the pharisees,
42750 ^ lovers of money being,
42752 ^ and they were ridiculing him.
42755 ^ and he said to them,
42758 ^ you are
42760 ^ those justifying themselves before - men,
42766 ^ - but
42768 ^ god knows the hearts of you;
42773 ^ for that which among men [is] exalted [is] an abomination before - god.
42782 ^ the law and the prophets [were] until john;
42789 ^ from that time the kingdom - of god is proclaimed,
42796 ^ and everyone into it forces his way.
42801 ^ easier for however it is
42804 ^ the heaven and the earth to pass away,
42810 ^ than
42811 ^ of the law one stroke of a pen to fail.
42816 ^ everyone
42817 ^ - putting away the wife of him
42822 ^ and marrying another commits adultery.
42826 ^ and
42827 ^ the [one]
42828 ^ her put away from a husband
42831 ^ marrying commits adultery.
42833 ^ a man now
42835 ^ certain there was rich,
42838 ^ and he was clothed in purple and fine linen,
42843 ^ making good cheer every day in splendor.
42847 ^ a poor man now
42849 ^ certain named lazarus was laid at the gate of him,
42857 ^ being full of sores
42858 ^ and desiring
42860 ^ to be fed
42861 ^ from that falling from the table of the rich man;
42869 ^ but even the dogs,
42873 ^ coming, were licking the sores of him.
42878 ^ it came to pass that then
42880 ^ died the poor man,
42883 ^ and was carried away he by the angels into the bosom of abraham.
42893 ^ died then also the rich man
42898 ^ and was buried.
42900 ^ and in - hades,
42904 ^ having lifted up the eyes of him,
42908 ^ being in torment, he sees abraham from afar,
42915 ^ and lazarus in the bosom of him.
42921 ^ and he
42923 ^ having cried out said,
42925 ^ father abraham, have mercy on me
42929 ^ and send lazarus,
42932 ^ that he might dip the tip of the finger of him in water
42940 ^ and cool the tongue of me;
42945 ^ for i am suffering in the flame this.
42951 ^ said then abraham,
42954 ^ child, remember
42956 ^ that you did fully receive the [things] good of you in the lifetime of you,
42965 ^ and lazarus likewise the [things] evil.
42970 ^ now however here he is comforted;
42974 ^ you now are suffering.
42977 ^ and besides all these things, between us and you a chasm great has been fixed,
42988 ^ so that
42989 ^ those desiring
42991 ^ to pass from here to you not are able,
42997 ^ nor from there to us can they pass.
43002 ^ he said then,
43004 ^ i implore you then, father,
43008 ^ that you would send him to the house of the father of me —
43017 ^ i have for five brothers —
43021 ^ so that he might warn them,
43024 ^ that not also they might come to the place this - of torment.
43035 ^ says however abraham,
43038 ^ they have moses and the prophets;
43043 ^ let them hear them.
43045 ^ - and he said,
43048 ^ no, father abraham,
43051 ^ but if one from [the] dead should go to them,
43059 ^ they will repent.
43060 ^ he said however to him,
43063 ^ if moses and the prophets not they hear,
43070 ^ not even
43071 ^ if one out from [the] dead should rise, will they be persuaded.
43077 ^ he said then to the disciples of him,
43083 ^ impossible it is
43085 ^ for the stumbling blocks not
43089 ^ to come,
43090 ^ but woe [to him]
43092 ^ by whom they come!
43095 ^ it is better for him
43097 ^ if a stone of a mill is hung around the neck of him
43105 ^ and he is thrown into the sea,
43110 ^ than that he should cause to stumble - little of these one.
43117 ^ take heed to yourselves.
43119 ^ if should sin the brother of you,
43124 ^ rebuke him;
43126 ^ and if he should repent,
43129 ^ forgive him.
43131 ^ and if seven times in the day he should sin against you,
43139 ^ and seven times should return to you,
43144 ^ saying
43145 ^ i repent,
43146 ^ you shall forgive him.
43148 ^ and said the apostles to the lord,
43154 ^ add to us faith!
43157 ^ said then the lord,
43161 ^ if you have faith like a grain of mustard,
43167 ^ you would have said - to the mulberry tree this,
43172 ^ be uprooted
43173 ^ and be planted in the sea,
43178 ^ and it would have obeyed - you.
43182 ^ which now
43184 ^ of you
43186 ^ a servant having,
43188 ^ plowing
43189 ^ or shepherding,
43191 ^ the [one]
43192 ^ having come in out of the field, will say to him,
43198 ^ immediately having come, recline?
43201 ^ but not will he say to him,
43205 ^ prepare
43206 ^ what i may eat,
43208 ^ and
43209 ^ having girded yourself about, serve me
43212 ^ while i eat
43214 ^ and drink;
43216 ^ and after these things shall eat
43220 ^ and drink you?’
43223 ^ not is he thankful to the servant
43228 ^ because he did
43230 ^ the things having been commanded?
43232 ^ thus also you,
43235 ^ when you may have done all
43238 ^ the [things] having been commanded you, say
43242 ^ -, servants unworthy are we;
43246 ^ that which we were bound to do, we have done.
43250 ^ and it came to pass
43252 ^ in the going up to jerusalem
43257 ^ that he was passing through [the] midst of samaria and galilee.
43265 ^ and on entering of him into a certain village,
43271 ^ met him ten leprous men,
43276 ^ who stood afar off.
43279 ^ and they lifted up [their] voice,
43283 ^ saying,
43284 ^ jesus, master, have compassion on us.
43288 ^ and
43289 ^ having seen [them], he said to them,
43292 ^ having gone, show yourselves to the priests.
43297 ^ and it came to pass
43299 ^ in the going them,
43303 ^ they were cleansed.
43304 ^ one then
43306 ^ of them,
43308 ^ having seen
43309 ^ that he was healed, turned back,
43312 ^ with a voice loud glorifying - god,
43318 ^ and he fell on [his] face at the feet of him,
43326 ^ giving thanks to him;
43328 ^ and he was a samaritan.
43332 ^ having answered then, - jesus said,
43337 ^ not the ten were cleansed?
43341 ^ - but
43343 ^ the nine are where?
43345 ^ none was there found
43347 ^ having returned to give glory - to god,
43352 ^ if not the foreigner this?
43357 ^ and he said to him,
43360 ^ having risen up go forth;
43362 ^ the faith of you has cured you!”
43367 ^ having been asked now by the pharisees
43372 ^ when is coming the kingdom - of god, he answered them
43380 ^ and said,
43382 ^ not comes the kingdom - of god with careful observation,
43390 ^ nor will they say,
43392 ^ behold here,
43394 ^ or there.
43396 ^ behold for,
43398 ^ the kingdom - of god in the midst of you is.”
43405 ^ he said then to the disciples,
43410 ^ will come days
43412 ^ when you will desire
43414 ^ one of the days of the son - of man to see,
43422 ^ and not you will see [it].
43425 ^ and they will say to you,
43428 ^ behold there,
43430 ^ or behold here.
43433 ^ not go forth
43435 ^ nor follow.
43437 ^ as for the lightning
43441 ^ flashing from the [one end] of the sky to the [other end] of the sky shines,
43452 ^ thus will be the son - of man in the day of him.
43462 ^ first however it behooves
43465 ^ him many things to suffer,
43468 ^ and to be rejected by the generation this.
43474 ^ and as it came to pass in the days of noah,
43481 ^ thus will it be also in the days of the son of man:
43491 ^ they were eating,
43492 ^ they were drinking,
43493 ^ they were marrying,
43494 ^ they were being given in marriage,
43495 ^ until that day entered noah into the ark,
43503 ^ and came the flood
43507 ^ and destroyed all.
43510 ^ likewise, as it came to pass in the days of lot,
43517 ^ they were eating,
43518 ^ they were drinking,
43519 ^ they were buying,
43520 ^ they were selling,
43521 ^ they were planting,
43522 ^ they were building;
43523 ^ in that then day went out lot from sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
43536 ^ and destroyed all.
43539 ^ according - to these will it be
43543 ^ in that day the son - of man is revealed.
43550 ^ in that - day,
43554 ^ the [one who] will be on the housetop,
43559 ^ and the goods of him in the house, not let him come down
43568 ^ to take away them;
43570 ^ and the [one] in [the] field, likewise not let him return to the things behind.
43580 ^ remember the wife of lot!
43584 ^ whoever if may seek
43587 ^ the life of him to save, will lose it;
43593 ^ whoever also - will lose [it], will preserve it.
43599 ^ i say to you,
43601 ^ in that - night there will be two upon bed one:
43609 ^ the one will be taken,
43612 ^ and the other will be left.
43616 ^ there will be two [women]
43618 ^ grinding at the same [place]:
43622 ^ the one will be taken,
43625 ^ - and
43627 ^ the other will be left.”
43629 ^ and
43630 ^ answering, they say to him,
43633 ^ where, lord?
43635 ^ - and he said to them,
43639 ^ where the body [is],
43642 ^ there also the vultures will be gathered together.
43647 ^ he was speaking then a parable to them
43651 ^ about the [way] it behooves
43654 ^ always to pray them
43657 ^ and not to lose heart,
43660 ^ saying,
43661 ^ a judge certain there was in a certain city,
43667 ^ - god not fearing
43671 ^ and man not respecting.
43675 ^ a widow then there was in the city that,
43682 ^ and she was coming to him,
43686 ^ saying,
43687 ^ avenge me of the adversary of me.
43693 ^ and not he would for a time;
43698 ^ afterward
43699 ^ however
43700 ^ he said within himself,
43704 ^ if even - god not i fear,
43710 ^ nor man respect,
43713 ^ because yet
43715 ^ - causes me trouble the widow this, i will avenge her,
43724 ^ so that not
43726 ^ to end coming, she exhaust me.
43731 ^ said then the lord,
43735 ^ hear
43736 ^ what the judge - unrighteous says.
43742 ^ - and
43744 ^ god no not shall execute the avenging of the elect of him,
43753 ^ the [ones] crying out to him day and night,
43759 ^ and be deferring in regard to them?
43763 ^ i say to you
43765 ^ that he will execute the avenging of them in quickness.
43772 ^ nevertheless, the son - of man
43777 ^ having come, indeed will he find - faith on the earth?
43785 ^ he spoke now also to some
43790 ^ - trusting in themselves
43794 ^ that they are righteous,
43797 ^ and despising the others, the parable this:
43804 ^ men two went up into the temple
43810 ^ to pray,
43811 ^ the one a pharisee,
43814 ^ and the other a tax collector.
43818 ^ the pharisee,
43820 ^ having stood, toward himself thus was praying,
43825 ^ - god, i thank you
43829 ^ that not i am like the rest of the men — swindlers, unrighteous, adulterers —
43840 ^ or even like this - tax collector.
43846 ^ i fast twice in the week;
43850 ^ i tithe all things,
43852 ^ as many as i gain.
43854 ^ - but
43856 ^ the tax collector,
43857 ^ afar off standing, not was willing
43861 ^ not even the eyes to lift up to - heaven,
43868 ^ but was striking the breast of himself,
43873 ^ saying
43874 ^ -, god, be merciful to me, the sinner!
43880 ^ i say to you,
43882 ^ went down this one
43884 ^ justified to the house of him, rather than that.
43891 ^ for everyone
43893 ^ - exalting himself will be humbled;
43897 ^ the [one] however humbling himself will be exalted.
43902 ^ they were bringing then to him also the infants,
43908 ^ that them he might touch;
43911 ^ having seen however, the disciples were rebuking them.
43917 ^ - but
43919 ^ jesus, having called to [him] them,
43922 ^ said,
43923 ^ permit the little children
43926 ^ to come to me,
43929 ^ and not do forbid them;
43933 ^ of the for
43935 ^ such is the kingdom - of god.
43941 ^ truly i say to you,
43944 ^ whoever - not shall receive the kingdom - of god as a child, no not shall enter into it.
43959 ^ and asked a certain him
43963 ^ ruler,
43964 ^ saying,
43965 ^ teacher good,
43967 ^ what having done, life eternal will i inherit?
43972 ^ said then to him - jesus,
43977 ^ why me call you good?
43981 ^ no one [is] good,
43983 ^ if not alone - god.
43988 ^ the commandments you know:
43991 ^ not shall you commit adultery,
43993 ^ not shall you murder,
43995 ^ not shall you steal,
43997 ^ not shall you bear false witness,
43999 ^ you shall honor the father of you and the mother.’
44006 ^ - and he said,
44009 ^ these all have i kept from [the] youth
44014 ^ having heard then, - jesus said to him,
44020 ^ yet one thing to you is lacking:
44024 ^ all,
44025 ^ as much as you have, sell,
44028 ^ and distribute to [the] poor,
44031 ^ and you will have treasure in the heavens;
44037 ^ and come,
44039 ^ follow me.
44041 ^ - and
44043 ^ having heard these things, very sorrowful he became;
44047 ^ he was for rich extremely.
44051 ^ having seen then him, - jesus
44056 ^ sorrowful became, saying,
44059 ^ how difficultly
44061 ^ those - riches
44064 ^ having, into the kingdom - of god shall enter.
44071 ^ easier for it is
44074 ^ a camel through an eye of a needle to go,
44079 ^ than
44080 ^ a rich man into the kingdom - of god to enter.
44087 ^ said then
44089 ^ those having heard,
44091 ^ then who is able
44094 ^ to be saved?
44095 ^ - but he said,
44098 ^ the things impossible with men, possible with - god are.
44107 ^ said then - peter,
44111 ^ behold,
44112 ^ we
44113 ^ having left the own, followed you.
44118 ^ - and he said to them,
44122 ^ truly i say to you
44125 ^ that no one there is
44128 ^ who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom - of god,
44144 ^ who no nothing shall receive manifold more in the time this —
44153 ^ and in the age
44157 ^ that is coming, life eternal.
44161 ^ having taken aside then the twelve, he said to them,
44168 ^ behold,
44169 ^ we go up to jerusalem,
44172 ^ and will be accomplished all things
44175 ^ - having been written by the prophets about the son - of man.
44184 ^ he will be betrayed for to the gentiles,
44188 ^ and will be mocked,
44190 ^ and will be insulted,
44192 ^ and will be spit upon.
44194 ^ and
44195 ^ having flogged [him], they will kill him;
44198 ^ and on the day - third he will rise again.
44204 ^ and they none of these things understood;
44209 ^ and was the word this
44214 ^ hidden from them,
44217 ^ and neither they knew
44220 ^ the things being spoken.
44222 ^ it came to pass then
44224 ^ in the drawing near of him to jericho,
44230 ^ a blind [man] certain was sitting beside the road,
44236 ^ begging.
44237 ^ having heard now a crowd
44240 ^ passing along, he was asking
44242 ^ what might be this.
44245 ^ they told then him
44248 ^ -, jesus of nazareth is passing by.
44253 ^ and he called out
44255 ^ saying,
44256 ^ jesus, son of david, have mercy on me.
44261 ^ and
44262 ^ those going before were rebuking him,
44266 ^ that he should be silent.
44268 ^ he however much more kept crying out,
44273 ^ son of david, have mercy on me.
44277 ^ having stopped then, - jesus commanded
44282 ^ him to be brought to him.
44286 ^ having drawn near then him,
44289 ^ he asked him,
44291 ^ what to you desire you i shall do?
44295 ^ - and he said,
44298 ^ lord, that i might receive sight.
44301 ^ and - jesus said to him,
44306 ^ receive sight!
44307 ^ the faith of you has healed you.
44312 ^ and immediately he received sight
44315 ^ and began following him,
44318 ^ glorifying - god.
44321 ^ and all the people,
44325 ^ having seen [it], gave praise - to god.
44330 ^ and
44331 ^ having entered, he was passing through - jericho.
44335 ^ and behold,
44337 ^ a man
44338 ^ by name called
44340 ^ zacchaeus,
44341 ^ and he was a chief tax collector,
44345 ^ and he [was] rich.
44348 ^ and he was seeking
44350 ^ to see
44351 ^ - jesus, who he is,
44355 ^ and not he was able because of the crowd,
44361 ^ because - in stature small he was.
44366 ^ and
44367 ^ having run to the front he went up into a sycamore-fig tree,
44374 ^ so that he might see him,
44377 ^ for
44378 ^ that [way] he was about to pass.
44381 ^ and as he came to the place,
44387 ^ having looked up, - jesus said to him,
44393 ^ zacchaeus,
44394 ^ having hurried come down;
44396 ^ today for in the house of you it behooves
44403 ^ me to stay.
44405 ^ and
44406 ^ having hurried, he came down
44408 ^ and received him,
44411 ^ rejoicing.
44412 ^ and
44413 ^ having seen [it], all were grumbling,
44416 ^ saying
44417 ^ -,
44418 ^ with a sinful man he has entered to stay.
44423 ^ having stood then, zacchaeus said to the lord,
44430 ^ behold,
44431 ^ the half
44433 ^ of me of the possessions, lord, to the poor i give;
44440 ^ and if of anyone anything i have defrauded,
44445 ^ i restore [it] fourfold.
44447 ^ said then to him - jesus
44453 ^ -, today salvation to the house this has come,
44460 ^ because also he a son of abraham is.
44466 ^ came for the son - of man
44472 ^ to seek
44473 ^ and to save
44475 ^ that having been lost.
44477 ^ were hearing while they these things,
44481 ^ having proceeded, he spoke a parable,
44484 ^ because - near
44487 ^ being
44488 ^ jerusalem of his,
44490 ^ and thinking their
44493 ^ that immediately is about the kingdom - of god
44500 ^ to appear.
44501 ^ he said therefore,
44503 ^ a man certain of noble birth proceeded to a country distant,
44510 ^ to receive for himself a kingdom
44513 ^ and to return.
44515 ^ having called then ten servants of himself, he gave to them ten minas
44524 ^ and said to them,
44528 ^ do business
44529 ^ until that i come back.
44532 ^ - but
44534 ^ the citizens of him hated him
44538 ^ and sent a delegation after him,
44543 ^ saying,
44544 ^ not we are willing [for]
44546 ^ this [man] to reign over us.
44550 ^ and it came to pass
44552 ^ on the returning of him,
44556 ^ having received the kingdom,
44559 ^ that he directed
44561 ^ to be called to him the servants these
44566 ^ to whom he had given the money,
44570 ^ in order that he might know
44572 ^ what they had gained by trading.
44574 ^ came up then the first,
44578 ^ saying,
44579 ^ lord, the mina of you, ten has produced
44585 ^ more minas.
44586 ^ and he said to him,
44589 ^ well done, good servant!
44592 ^ because in very little, faithful you were,
44597 ^ to be
44598 ^ having authority you are
44600 ^ over ten cities.
44603 ^ and came the second,
44607 ^ saying,
44608 ^ the mina of you, lord, has made five minas.
44615 ^ he said then also to this one,
44619 ^ and you over are to be
44623 ^ five cities.
44625 ^ and - another came,
44629 ^ saying,
44630 ^ lord, behold
44632 ^ the mina of you,
44635 ^ which i kept lying away in a piece of cloth.
44640 ^ i was afraid for of you,
44643 ^ because a man harsh you are.
44647 ^ you take up
44648 ^ what not you did lay down,
44651 ^ and you reap
44653 ^ what not you did sow.
44656 ^ he says to him,
44658 ^ out of the mouth of you i will judge you, evil servant.
44666 ^ you knew
44667 ^ that i a man harsh am,
44672 ^ taking up
44673 ^ what not i did lay down
44676 ^ and reaping
44678 ^ what not i did sow?
44681 ^ then because of why not did you give of me the money to [the] bank,
44691 ^ and i
44692 ^ having come, with interest - it might have collected?
44698 ^ and
44699 ^ to those standing by he said,
44702 ^ take from him the mina,
44707 ^ and give [it]
44709 ^ to the [one] the ten minas
44713 ^ having.
44714 ^ and they said to him,
44717 ^ master, he has ten minas.
44721 ^ i say to you
44723 ^ that
44724 ^ to everyone - having will be given;
44728 ^ from however the [one] not
44732 ^ having, even
44734 ^ that which he has will be taken away.
44737 ^ furthermore, the enemies of mine these,
44742 ^ those not
44744 ^ having been willing [for]
44745 ^ me to reign over them, bring here
44751 ^ and slay them before me.
44756 ^ and
44757 ^ having said these things he went on ahead,
44761 ^ going up to jerusalem.
44764 ^ and it came to pass
44766 ^ as he drew near to bethphage and bethany, toward the mount
44775 ^ - called olivet,
44778 ^ he sent two of the disciples,
44782 ^ saying,
44783 ^ go into the ahead village,
44788 ^ in which
44790 ^ entering you will find a colt
44793 ^ having been tied,
44794 ^ on which no one ever yet
44798 ^ of men has sat;
44800 ^ and
44801 ^ having untied it, bring [it].
44804 ^ and if anyone you asks,
44809 ^ because of why do you untie [it]?
44812 ^ thus will you say,
44814 ^ because the lord of it need has.’
44820 ^ having departed then,
44822 ^ those having been sent found [it]
44825 ^ as he had said to them.
44828 ^ on untying then of them the colt,
44833 ^ said the masters of it to them,
44839 ^ why untie you the colt?
44843 ^ - and they said
44846 ^ -, the lord of it need has.
44852 ^ and they led it to - jesus,
44858 ^ and
44859 ^ having cast their - garments on the colt, they put on [it] - jesus.
44869 ^ going then of him,
44872 ^ they were spreading the garments of them on the road.
44879 ^ drawing near then of him already at the descent of the mount - of olives,
44890 ^ began all the multitude of the disciples,
44896 ^ rejoicing, to praise - god in a voice loud for all
44904 ^ which they had seen [the] mighty works,
44907 ^ saying:
44908 ^ blessed is the coming - king in [the] name of [the] lord.”
44916 ^ in heaven peace,
44919 ^ and glory in [the] highest.
44923 ^ and some of the pharisees from the crowd said to him,
44933 ^ teacher, rebuke the disciples of you.
44938 ^ and
44939 ^ answering, he said,
44941 ^ i say to you
44943 ^ if these will be silent,
44946 ^ the stones will cry out.
44949 ^ and as he drew near,
44952 ^ having seen the city, he wept over it,
44958 ^ saying
44959 ^ -, if you had known in the day this, even you, the things for peace!
44971 ^ now however they are hidden from eyes of you.
44977 ^ for will come days upon you
44982 ^ that will cast around the enemies of you a barricade you;
44989 ^ and they will surround you
44992 ^ and will hem in you on every side,
44996 ^ and will level to the ground you and the children of you within you,
45005 ^ and not will leave a stone upon a stone within you,
45013 ^ in place of which not you knew the season the of visitation of you.
45022 ^ and
45023 ^ having entered into the temple, he began
45028 ^ to cast out
45029 ^ those selling,
45031 ^ saying to them,
45033 ^ it has been written:
45034 ^ and will be the house of me a house of prayer.’
45041 ^ you however it have made a den of robbers.’
45047 ^ and he was
45049 ^ teaching - every day in the temple;
45056 ^ the however
45058 ^ chief priests and the scribes were seeking
45063 ^ him to destroy,
45065 ^ and the foremost of the people.
45070 ^ and not they found
45073 ^ - what they might do;
45076 ^ the people for
45079 ^ all were hanging on
45081 ^ his [words], listening.
45083 ^ and it came to pass on one of the days,
45089 ^ as was teaching he the people in the temple
45096 ^ and proclaiming the gospel,
45098 ^ came up the chief priests and the scribes with the elders
45107 ^ and spoke,
45109 ^ saying to him,
45112 ^ tell us
45114 ^ by what authority these things you do,
45119 ^ or who is
45122 ^ the [one] having given to you the authority this?
45128 ^ answering now, he said to them,
45133 ^ will ask you i also one thing,
45137 ^ and you tell me:
45140 ^ the baptism of john, from heaven was it,
45146 ^ or from men?
45149 ^ - and they reasoned among themselves,
45154 ^ saying
45155 ^ -, if we should say
45158 ^ from heaven,
45160 ^ he will say,
45161 ^ because of why not did you believe him?
45166 ^ if however we should say,
45169 ^ from men,
45171 ^ the people all will stone us;
45176 ^ having been persuaded for they are,
45179 ^ john a prophet to be.
45182 ^ and they answered,
45184 ^ not they knew from where.
45187 ^ and - jesus said to them,
45192 ^ neither i tell you
45196 ^ by what authority these things i am doing.
45201 ^ he began then
45203 ^ to the people to speak the parable this:
45210 ^ a man certain planted a vineyard,
45214 ^ and rented it to farmers,
45218 ^ and went abroad a time long.
45222 ^ and [in the] season, he sent to the farmers a servant,
45229 ^ that from the fruit of the vineyard they will give to him.
45237 ^ - but
45239 ^ the farmers sent away him,
45242 ^ having beaten [him], empty-handed.
45244 ^ and he proceeded
45246 ^ another to send
45248 ^ a servant;
45249 ^ - but
45251 ^ him having beaten
45253 ^ and having dishonored, they sent away empty-handed.
45257 ^ and he proceeded
45259 ^ a third to send;
45261 ^ - then
45263 ^ also him having wounded, they cast out.
45267 ^ said then the master of the vineyard,
45273 ^ what shall i do?
45275 ^ i will send the son of me, the beloved;
45281 ^ perhaps him they will respect.
45284 ^ having seen now him, the farmers began reasoning among themselves,
45292 ^ saying,
45293 ^ this is the heir;
45297 ^ let us kill him,
45299 ^ so that ours might become the inheritance.
45304 ^ and
45305 ^ having cast forth him outside the vineyard, they killed [him].
45311 ^ what therefore will do to them the master of the vineyard?
45319 ^ he will come
45320 ^ and will destroy the farmers these,
45325 ^ and will give the vineyard to others.
45330 ^ having heard [it], then they said,
45333 ^ never may it be!
45335 ^ - but
45337 ^ having looked at them, he said,
45340 ^ what then is
45343 ^ that has been written this:
45346 ^ [the] stone
45347 ^ which rejected
45349 ^ those building,
45351 ^ this has become into [the] head of [the] corner’
45356 ^ everyone
45357 ^ - falling on that - stone will be broken;
45364 ^ on whomever but - it might fall,
45369 ^ it will grind into powder him.
45371 ^ and sought the scribes and the chief priests
45378 ^ to lay on him - hands in that - hour;
45387 ^ and they feared the people;
45391 ^ they perceived for
45393 ^ that against them he was speaking the parable this.
45400 ^ and
45401 ^ having watched [him], they sent spies,
45404 ^ feigning
45405 ^ themselves righteous to be,
45408 ^ that they might catch him in talk,
45412 ^ in order to deliver him to the rule and to the authority of the governor.
45422 ^ and they questioned him,
45425 ^ saying,
45426 ^ teacher, we know
45428 ^ that rightly you speak
45431 ^ and teach,
45433 ^ and not receive [any] person,
45437 ^ but on the basis of truth the way - of god teach.
45445 ^ is it lawful
45446 ^ for us to caesar tribute to give,
45450 ^ or not?
45452 ^ having perceived however of them the craftiness, he said to them,
45460 ^ show me a denarius.
45463 ^ of whom has it
45465 ^ [the] image and inscription?
45468 ^ - and they said,
45471 ^ caesar’s.
45472 ^ - and he said to them,
45477 ^ therefore give back the things of caesar to caesar,
45482 ^ and the things - of god - to god.
45488 ^ and not they were able
45491 ^ to catch him in his word before the people;
45497 ^ and
45498 ^ having marveled at the answer of him, they became silent.
45504 ^ having approached then some of the sadducees,
45509 ^ the ones denying
45511 ^ a resurrection not there is, they questioned him,
45516 ^ saying,
45517 ^ teacher, moses wrote to us
45521 ^ if anyone’s brother should die
45525 ^ having a wife,
45527 ^ and he childless is,
45531 ^ that should take the brother of him the wife
45538 ^ and should raise up seed to the brother of him.
45544 ^ seven therefore
45546 ^ brothers there were;
45548 ^ and the first,
45551 ^ having taken a wife, died childless;
45555 ^ and the second,
45558 ^ and the third took her;
45563 ^ likewise then also the seven
45568 ^ not did leave children,
45571 ^ and died.
45573 ^ finally also the woman died.
45578 ^ the woman therefore, in the resurrection, of which of them does she become
45587 ^ wife?
45588 ^ - for
45590 ^ the seven had her as wife.
45594 ^ and said to them - jesus,
45599 ^ the sons of the age this marry
45605 ^ and are given in marriage;
45607 ^ those however having been considered worthy
45610 ^ to the age that which [is] to obtain,
45614 ^ and the resurrection which [is] out from [the] dead, neither marry
45622 ^ nor are given in marriage;
45624 ^ neither for
45626 ^ to die any more are they able,
45629 ^ like [the] angels for they are;
45632 ^ and sons they are
45635 ^ of god,
45636 ^ of the resurrection sons being.
45640 ^ that however are raised the dead,
45645 ^ even moses showed at the bush,
45651 ^ when he calls
45653 ^ [the] lord the god of abraham, and god of isaac, and god of jacob.’
45663 ^ god now not he is
45667 ^ of [the] dead,
45668 ^ but
45669 ^ of [the] living;
45670 ^ all for to him live.
45674 ^ answering now, some of the scribes said,
45680 ^ teacher, well you have spoken.
45683 ^ no longer then did they dare
45686 ^ to ask him anything.
45689 ^ he said then to them,
45693 ^ how do they declare
45695 ^ the christ to be of david son?
45700 ^ himself for
45702 ^ david says in [the] book of psalms:
45707 ^ said [the] lord to the lord of me,
45712 ^ sit at [the] right hand of me,
45716 ^ until - i place the enemies of you, [as] a footstool of the feet of you.”’
45726 ^ david therefore lord him calls,
45731 ^ and how of him son is he?
45736 ^ were listening now all the people,
45741 ^ he said to the disciples of him,
45745 ^ beware of the scribes,
45749 ^ - desiring
45751 ^ to walk in long robes,
45754 ^ and loving greetings in the marketplaces, and first seats in the synagogues, and first places in the banquets;
45770 ^ who devour the houses of widows,
45776 ^ and as a pretext at great length pray.
45780 ^ these will receive more abundant condemnation.
45784 ^ having looked up now, he saw the ones
45788 ^ casting into the treasury the gifts of them rich.
45796 ^ he saw then a certain widow poor
45801 ^ casting in lepta two.
45805 ^ and he said,
45807 ^ truly i say to you
45810 ^ that the widow this - poor, more than all has cast in;
45819 ^ all for
45821 ^ these
45822 ^ out of that which was abounding to them cast in the gifts;
45830 ^ she however, out of the poverty of her, all the livelihood
45839 ^ that she had did cast.
45842 ^ and as some were speaking about the temple,
45848 ^ that with stones goodly and consecrated gifts it was adorned,
45854 ^ he said,
45855 ^ [as to] these things
45856 ^ which you are beholding,
45858 ^ will come [the] days
45860 ^ in which not will be left stone upon stone
45867 ^ which not will be thrown down.
45870 ^ they asked then him,
45873 ^ saying,
45874 ^ teacher, when then these things will be,
45879 ^ and what [will be] the sign
45883 ^ when are about these things
45886 ^ to take place?
45887 ^ - and he said,
45890 ^ take heed,
45891 ^ lest you be led astray;
45893 ^ many for will come in the name of me,
45900 ^ saying,
45901 ^ i am [he],
45903 ^ and the time is drawn near.
45907 ^ not go after them.
45911 ^ when then you should hear of wars and commotions,
45917 ^ not be terrified;
45919 ^ it behooves for
45921 ^ these things to take place first,
45924 ^ but not immediately [is] the end.
45929 ^ then he was saying to them,
45932 ^ will rise up nation against nation,
45936 ^ and kingdom against kingdom.
45940 ^ earthquakes both great, and in different places famines and pestilences there will be;
45950 ^ fearful sights also and from heaven signs great will there be.
45958 ^ before however
45960 ^ these things all, they will lay upon you the hands of them,
45968 ^ and will persecute [you],
45970 ^ delivering [you] to the synagogues and prisons,
45976 ^ bringing [you] before kings and governors on account of the name of me.
45985 ^ it will result to you for a testimony.
45989 ^ settle therefore in the minds of you
45995 ^ not to premeditate
45997 ^ to make a defense;
45998 ^ i for will give you a mouth and wisdom,
46005 ^ which not will be able
46008 ^ to resist
46009 ^ nor to reply to all
46012 ^ those opposing you.
46015 ^ you will be betrayed then even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends,
46026 ^ and they will put to death [some] from among you.
46030 ^ and you will be
46032 ^ hated by all because of the name of me.
46039 ^ but a hair of the head of you no not should perish.
46048 ^ by the patient endurance of you, you will gain the souls of you.
46056 ^ when then you see
46059 ^ being encircled by encampments jerusalem,
46063 ^ then know
46065 ^ that has drawn near the desolation of her.
46070 ^ then those in - judea, let them flee to the mountains;
46079 ^ and those in midst of her, let them depart out;
46085 ^ and those in the countries, not let them enter into her;
46094 ^ for [the] days of avenging these are,
46099 ^ - to fulfill
46101 ^ all things - having been written.
46104 ^ but woe
46105 ^ to those in womb
46108 ^ having,
46109 ^ and to the [ones] nursing in those the days;
46116 ^ there will be for distress great upon the land and wrath to the people this.
46128 ^ and they will fall by [the] edge of [the] sword,
46132 ^ and will be led captive into the nations; all
46138 ^ and jerusalem will be
46141 ^ trodden down by [the] gentiles,
46144 ^ until that are fulfilled [the] times of [the] gentiles.
46149 ^ and there will be signs in sun, and moon, and stars;
46158 ^ and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity, [the] roaring of [the] sea and rolling surge,
46170 ^ fainting men from fear and expectation
46176 ^ of that which is coming on the earth;
46180 ^ - for
46182 ^ the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
46186 ^ and then will they see the son - of man
46193 ^ coming in a cloud, with power and glory great.
46201 ^ beginning then of these things
46204 ^ to come to pass,
46205 ^ look up
46206 ^ and lift up the heads of you,
46211 ^ because draws near the redemption of you.
46216 ^ and he spoke a parable to them:
46220 ^ behold the fig tree and all the trees.
46227 ^ when they sprout already,
46230 ^ looking [on them] for yourselves, you know
46234 ^ that already near the summer is.
46240 ^ so also you,
46243 ^ when you see these things
46246 ^ coming to pass, know
46248 ^ that near is the kingdom - of god.
46255 ^ truly i say to you,
46258 ^ that no not will have passed away the generation this,
46265 ^ until - all [these things] shall have taken place.
46269 ^ the heaven and the earth will pass away,
46275 ^ - but
46277 ^ the words of me no not will pass away.
46282 ^ take heed now to yourselves,
46285 ^ lest ever be burdened of you the hearts with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of life —
46297 ^ and would come upon you suddenly the day that as a snare.
46307 ^ it will come for
46309 ^ upon all those sitting upon the face of all the earth.
46318 ^ watch also at every season,
46323 ^ praying
46324 ^ that you may have strength
46326 ^ to escape these things all
46329 ^ that are about
46331 ^ to come to pass
46332 ^ and to stand before the son - of man.
46339 ^ he was now
46341 ^ during the day in the temple teaching,
46347 ^ - and
46349 ^ the evening
46350 ^ going out, he was lodging on the mount
46355 ^ - called olivet.
46358 ^ and all the people would come early in the morning to him in the temple
46368 ^ to hear him.
46370 ^ was drawing near now the feast of unleavened [bread],
46376 ^ - called passover.
46379 ^ and were seeking the chief priests and the scribes
46386 ^ - how they might put to death him;
46390 ^ they were afraid for of the people.
46394 ^ entered then satan into judas,
46399 ^ the [one] being called iscariot,
46402 ^ being of the number of the twelve.
46408 ^ and
46409 ^ having gone away, he spoke with the chief priests and captains,
46415 ^ the how to them he might betray him.
46420 ^ and they rejoiced
46422 ^ and agreed
46424 ^ him money to give.
46427 ^ and he promised,
46429 ^ and began seeking opportunity
46432 ^ - to betray him apart from [a] crowd to them.
46438 ^ came then the day of unleavened [bread]
46444 ^ on which it was necessary for to be sacrificed the passover lamb.
46450 ^ and he sent peter and john,
46455 ^ having said,
46456 ^ having gone, prepare for us the passover,
46461 ^ that we might eat [it].
46463 ^ - and they said to him,
46467 ^ where will you we should prepare?
46470 ^ - and he said to them,
46474 ^ behold,
46475 ^ having entered of you into the city,
46480 ^ will meet you a man,
46483 ^ a pitcher of water carrying;
46486 ^ follow him into the house
46491 ^ into which he enters;
46494 ^ and you shall say to the master of the house,
46500 ^ says to you the teacher,
46504 ^ where is the guest room,
46508 ^ where the passover with the disciples of me i may eat?
46516 ^ and he you will show an upper room large,
46521 ^ furnished;
46522 ^ there prepare.
46524 ^ having gone then, they found [it]
46527 ^ as he had said to them;
46530 ^ and they prepared the passover.
46534 ^ and when was come the hour,
46539 ^ he reclined,
46540 ^ and the apostles with him.
46545 ^ and he said to them,
46549 ^ with desire i have desired
46551 ^ this - passover to eat with you
46557 ^ before - i
46560 ^ suffer.
46561 ^ i say for to you
46564 ^ that never not will i eat thereof,
46569 ^ until when it is fulfilled in the kingdom - of god.
46577 ^ and
46578 ^ having received [the] cup,
46580 ^ having given thanks, he said,
46582 ^ take this,
46584 ^ and divide [it] among yourselves.
46588 ^ i say for to you,
46591 ^ that no not will i drink from - now of the fruit of the vine,
46603 ^ until that the kingdom - of god shall come.
46610 ^ and
46611 ^ having taken [the] bread,
46613 ^ having given thanks, he broke [it]
46615 ^ and gave to them,
46618 ^ saying,
46619 ^ this is the body of me,
46624 ^ which for you
46627 ^ is given;
46628 ^ this do in the of me remembrance,
46634 ^ and the cup likewise
46638 ^ after which having supped,
46641 ^ saying,
46642 ^ this - cup [is] the new covenant in the blood of me,
46652 ^ which for you
46655 ^ is being poured out.
46656 ^ but, behold,
46658 ^ the hand
46660 ^ of him betraying me [is] with me on the table.
46668 ^ for the son indeed
46672 ^ of man,
46674 ^ according to that having been determined goes,
46678 ^ but woe to the man that
46683 ^ by whom he is betrayed.
46686 ^ and they began
46689 ^ to question among themselves
46692 ^ - who then it might be
46696 ^ of them
46698 ^ who
46699 ^ this
46700 ^ is about
46701 ^ to do.
46702 ^ there was then also a dispute among them,
46708 ^ - which of them is thought
46712 ^ to be [the] greatest.
46714 ^ - and he said to them,
46718 ^ the kings of the gentiles rule over them,
46724 ^ and
46725 ^ those exercising authority over them, benefactors are called.
46730 ^ you however not thus [shall be].
46734 ^ instead, the greatest among you, let him be as the younger;
46743 ^ and
46744 ^ the [one] leading,
46746 ^ as the [one] serving.
46749 ^ who for [is] greater,
46752 ^ the [one] reclining
46754 ^ or the [one] serving?
46757 ^ [is] not
46758 ^ the [one] reclining?
46760 ^ i however in [the] midst of you am,
46766 ^ as the [one] serving.
46769 ^ you now are
46772 ^ those having remained with me in the trials of me.
46780 ^ and i appoint to you,
46783 ^ as appointed to me the father of me, a kingdom,
46790 ^ so that you may eat
46792 ^ and may drink at the table of me in the kingdom of me,
46802 ^ and may sit on thrones,
46806 ^ the twelve tribes judging
46810 ^ of israel.
46812 ^ simon, simon, behold,
46815 ^ - satan demanded to have
46818 ^ all of you - to sift like - wheat;
46824 ^ i however begged for you,
46829 ^ that not may fail the faith of you;
46835 ^ and you,
46837 ^ when you have turned back, strengthen the brothers of you.
46843 ^ - and he said to him,
46847 ^ lord,
46848 ^ with you ready i am both to prison and to death to go.
46859 ^ - and he said,
46862 ^ i tell you peter,
46865 ^ not will crow today [the] rooster,
46869 ^ until three times
46871 ^ me you will deny knowing.
46874 ^ and he said to them,
46877 ^ when i sent you without purse and bag and sandals,
46886 ^ not anything did you lack?
46889 ^ - and they said,
46892 ^ nothing.
46893 ^ he said then to them,
46896 ^ but now
46898 ^ the [one] having a purse, let him take [it];
46902 ^ likewise also a bag;
46905 ^ and
46906 ^ the [one] not
46908 ^ having, let him sell the cloak of him
46913 ^ and buy [one] a sword.
46916 ^ i say for to you
46919 ^ that this
46921 ^ which has been written, it behooves
46924 ^ to be accomplished in me:
46927 ^ -
46928 ^ and with the lawless he was reckoned.’
46932 ^ and for the things concerning me an end have.
46939 ^ - and they said,
46942 ^ lord, behold,
46944 ^ swords here [are]
46946 ^ two.
46947 ^ - and he said to them,
46951 ^ enough it is.
46953 ^ and
46954 ^ having gone forth, he went according to the custom to the mount - of olives;
46964 ^ followed then him also the disciples.
46970 ^ having come then to the place, he said to them,
46977 ^ pray
46978 ^ not to enter into temptation.
46982 ^ and he withdrew from them about a stone’s throw,
46990 ^ and
46991 ^ having fallen on the knees, he was praying,
46995 ^ saying,
46996 ^ father, if you are willing,
46999 ^ take away this - cup from me.
47005 ^ yet not the will of me,
47010 ^ but - of you be done.
47014 ^ appeared then to him an angel from heaven,
47020 ^ strengthening him.
47022 ^ and
47023 ^ having been in agony, more earnestly he was praying.
47028 ^ and became the sweat of him like great drops of blood,
47036 ^ falling down upon the ground.
47040 ^ and
47041 ^ having risen up from the prayer,
47045 ^ having come to the disciples, he found sleeping them from the grief,
47055 ^ and he said to them,
47058 ^ why are you sleeping?
47060 ^ having risen up pray,
47062 ^ that not you might enter into temptation.
47067 ^ while still of him speaking,
47070 ^ behold,
47071 ^ a crowd,
47072 ^ and he who is called judas,
47076 ^ one of the twelve, was going before them,
47081 ^ and he drew near - to jesus
47085 ^ to kiss him.
47087 ^ jesus then said to him,
47091 ^ judas, with a kiss the son - of man are you betraying?
47098 ^ having seen then those around him
47103 ^ what would be, they said,
47106 ^ lord, if will we strike with [the] sword?
47111 ^ and struck one a certain of them of the high priest the servant,
47121 ^ and cut off the ear, his - right.
47128 ^ answering now, - jesus said,
47133 ^ allow you as far as thus!
47136 ^ and
47137 ^ having touched the ear, he healed him.
47142 ^ said then jesus to those
47147 ^ having come out against him, chief priests, and captains of the temple, and elders,
47157 ^ as against a robber have you come out with swords and clubs?
47165 ^ every day being of me with you in the temple,
47174 ^ not did you stretch out the hands against me;
47180 ^ but this is of you the hour, and the power of the darkness.
47191 ^ having seized then him, they led [him] away,
47195 ^ and led [him] into the house of the high priest.
47202 ^ - and
47204 ^ peter was following afar off.
47207 ^ they having kindled then a fire in [the] midst of the courtyard,
47214 ^ and having sat down together,
47216 ^ was sitting - peter among them.
47221 ^ having seen then
47223 ^ him a servant girl certain
47226 ^ sitting by the light,
47230 ^ and having looked intently on him, she said,
47234 ^ also this one with him was.
47239 ^ - but he denied [it],
47242 ^ saying,
47243 ^ not i do know him, woman.
47247 ^ and after a little, another
47251 ^ having seen him, was saying,
47254 ^ also you of them are.
47259 ^ - but
47261 ^ peter was saying,
47263 ^ man, not i am.
47266 ^ and having elapsed about hour one,
47271 ^ other a certain strongly affirmed [it],
47274 ^ saying,
47275 ^ of a truth, also this one with him was;
47282 ^ also for a galilean he is.
47286 ^ said however - peter,
47290 ^ man, not i know
47293 ^ what you say.
47295 ^ and immediately
47297 ^ while he was speaking of him, crowed the rooster.
47302 ^ and
47303 ^ having turned, the lord looked at - peter,
47309 ^ and remembered - peter the word of the lord,
47317 ^ how he had said to him
47320 ^ -,
47321 ^ before [the] rooster
47323 ^ crows today, you will deny me three times.
47328 ^ and
47329 ^ having gone forth outside, he wept bitterly.
47333 ^ and the men
47336 ^ who are holding him began mocking him,
47341 ^ beating [him].
47342 ^ and
47343 ^ having blindfolded him, they were questioning [him],
47346 ^ saying,
47347 ^ prophesy,
47348 ^ who is
47350 ^ the [one] having struck you?
47353 ^ and other things many,
47356 ^ blaspheming, they were saying to him.
47360 ^ and when it became day,
47364 ^ were gathered together the elderhood of the people, chief priests both and scribes,
47373 ^ and they led him into the council of them,
47380 ^ saying,
47381 ^ if you are the christ,
47386 ^ tell us.
47388 ^ he said then to them,
47391 ^ if you i should tell,
47394 ^ no not would you believe;
47397 ^ if then i should ask [you],
47400 ^ no not would you answer.
47403 ^ from - now on also will be the son - of man
47412 ^ sitting at [the] right hand of the power - of god.
47419 ^ they said then all,
47422 ^ you then are the son - of god?
47429 ^ - and to them he was saying,
47434 ^ you say
47436 ^ that i am.
47439 ^ - and they said,
47442 ^ what any more have we of witness need?
47447 ^ we ourselves for have heard [it] from the mouth of him.
47454 ^ and
47455 ^ having risen up, all the multitude of them led him to - pilate.
47465 ^ they began then
47467 ^ to accuse him,
47469 ^ saying,
47470 ^ this [man] we found
47472 ^ misleading the nation of us
47476 ^ and forbidding
47478 ^ tribute to caesar to be given,
47481 ^ and declaring
47483 ^ himself christ, a king, to be.
47487 ^ - and
47489 ^ pilate questioned him,
47492 ^ saying,
47493 ^ you are the king of the jews?
47499 ^ - and
47501 ^ answering him, he was saying,
47504 ^ you say.
47506 ^ - and
47508 ^ pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds,
47516 ^ not find i
47518 ^ guilt in the man this.
47523 ^ - but they kept insisting,
47526 ^ saying
47527 ^ -, he stirs up the people,
47531 ^ teaching throughout all - of judea,
47536 ^ and he has begun from - galilee even to here.
47543 ^ pilate now
47545 ^ having heard, asked
47547 ^ whether the man a galilean is,
47552 ^ and
47553 ^ having learned
47554 ^ that from the jurisdiction of herod he is, he sent up him to herod,
47564 ^ being also he himself in jerusalem in those - days.
47573 ^ - and
47575 ^ herod,
47576 ^ having seen - jesus, [was] glad exceedingly;
47581 ^ he was for of a long time
47586 ^ wishing
47587 ^ to see him,
47589 ^ because of - hearing concerning him;
47594 ^ and he was hoping
47596 ^ some sign to see
47599 ^ by him done.
47602 ^ he kept questioning then him in words many;
47608 ^ he however nothing answered him.
47613 ^ had been standing by now the chief priests and the scribes,
47620 ^ vehemently accusing him.
47623 ^ having set at naught then
47625 ^ him, also - herod with the troops of him,
47633 ^ and having mocked [him],
47635 ^ having put on [him] apparel splendid, sent back him to pilate.
47642 ^ became then friends - both herod and - pilate on that - day with one another;
47657 ^ previously it had been that for
47659 ^ at enmity they were between themselves.
47664 ^ pilate then,
47666 ^ having called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, said to them,
47678 ^ you brought to me the man this,
47683 ^ as misleading the people;
47687 ^ and behold,
47689 ^ i
47690 ^ before you having examined [him], nothing found in the man this
47699 ^ guilty
47700 ^ of that accusation you are bringing against him.
47704 ^ no, not even herod [did];
47707 ^ he sent back for him to us.
47712 ^ and behold,
47714 ^ nothing worthy of death is
47718 ^ done by him.
47720 ^ having chastised therefore him, i will release [him].”
47724 ^ they cried out however all together,
47727 ^ saying,
47728 ^ away with this [man],
47730 ^ release now to us - barabbas,
47735 ^ who was
47737 ^ on account of insurrection a certain
47740 ^ having been made in the city, and murder, having been cast into the prison.
47750 ^ again therefore - pilate called to them,
47756 ^ wishing
47757 ^ to release - jesus.
47760 ^ - but they were crying out,
47763 ^ saying,
47764 ^ crucify,
47765 ^ crucify him.
47767 ^ - and a third [time] he said to them,
47773 ^ what for
47775 ^ evil did commit this [man]?
47778 ^ no cause of death found i in him.
47784 ^ having chastised therefore him, i will release [him].
47788 ^ - but they were urgent, with voices loud,
47793 ^ asking for
47794 ^ him to be crucified.
47796 ^ and were prevailing the voices of them.
47801 ^ and pilate sentenced
47804 ^ to be done the demand of them.
47808 ^ he released then
47810 ^ the [one] on account of insurrection and murder
47815 ^ having been cast into prison,
47818 ^ whom they had asked for;
47820 ^ - and
47822 ^ jesus he delivered to the will of them.
47827 ^ and as they led away him,
47831 ^ having laid hold on simon, a certain of cyrene,
47835 ^ coming from the country, they put upon him the cross,
47842 ^ to carry behind - jesus.
47846 ^ were following now him a great multitude of the people, and of women,
47855 ^ who were mourning
47857 ^ and lamenting for him.
47860 ^ having turned then to them, - jesus said,
47867 ^ daughters of jerusalem, not weep for me,
47873 ^ but for yourselves weep,
47877 ^ and for the children of you.
47882 ^ for behold,
47884 ^ are coming days
47886 ^ in which they will say,
47889 ^ blessed [are] the barren, and the wombs
47895 ^ that never did bear, and breasts
47900 ^ that never nursed.
47903 ^ then they will begin
47905 ^ to say to the mountains,
47908 ^ fall upon us,
47911 ^ and to the hills,
47914 ^ cover us.”’
47916 ^ for if in the green tree, these things they do;
47924 ^ in the dry, what might take place?
47929 ^ were being led away now also other criminals two,
47935 ^ with him to be put to death.
47938 ^ and when they came to the place
47944 ^ - called the skull,
47947 ^ there they crucified him, and the criminals,
47953 ^ one - on [the] right;
47957 ^ one now on [the] left.
47961 ^ - and
47963 ^ jesus was saying,
47965 ^ father, forgive them,
47968 ^ not for they know
47971 ^ what they do.”
47973 ^ dividing then the garments of him, they cast lots.
47980 ^ and stood the people
47984 ^ beholding.
47985 ^ were deriding [him] then also the rulers,
47990 ^ saying,
47991 ^ others he saved;
47993 ^ let him save himself
47995 ^ if this is the christ - of god, the chosen [one].
48004 ^ mocked then him also the soldiers,
48010 ^ coming near,
48011 ^ sour wine offering him,
48014 ^ and saying,
48016 ^ if you are the king of the jews,
48023 ^ save yourself!
48025 ^ there was now also an inscription over him,
48031 ^ the king of the jews this.
48036 ^ one now
48038 ^ of the
48039 ^ having been hanged criminals was railing at him,
48043 ^ saying
48044 ^ not you are if the christ?
48049 ^ save yourself and us!
48053 ^ answering now, the other
48057 ^ was rebuking him, saying,
48060 ^ not even do fear you - god,
48065 ^ that under the same judgment you are,
48071 ^ and we indeed justly?
48075 ^ worthy for
48077 ^ of what we did we are receiving;
48080 ^ [this] man however nothing wrong did.
48085 ^ and he was saying,
48087 ^ jesus, remember me
48090 ^ when you come into the kingdom of you!
48096 ^ and he said to him,
48099 ^ truly to you i say,
48102 ^ today with me you will be in - paradise.
48109 ^ and it was now about [the] hour sixth,
48115 ^ and darkness came over all the land until [the] hour ninth.
48125 ^ the sun was darkened;
48128 ^ was torn then the veil of the temple in [the] middle.
48135 ^ and
48136 ^ having called out in a voice loud, - jesus said,
48142 ^ father, into [the] hands of you i commit the spirit of me.”
48150 ^ this now having said, he breathed his last.
48154 ^ having seen now the centurion
48158 ^ that having taken place, he began glorifying - god,
48163 ^ saying,
48164 ^ certainly the man this righteous was.
48170 ^ and all the
48173 ^ having come together crowds
48175 ^ to the spectacle this,
48179 ^ having seen
48180 ^ the things having taken place,
48182 ^ beating the breasts were returning [home].
48186 ^ stood now all those who knew him from afar off,
48194 ^ also women,
48196 ^ those having followed him from - galilee,
48202 ^ beholding these things.
48204 ^ and behold,
48206 ^ a man named joseph,
48209 ^ a council member, being
48211 ^ also a man good and righteous,
48216 ^ he not was
48219 ^ having consented to the counsel and the deed of them, from arimathea, a city of the jews,
48231 ^ who was waiting for the kingdom - of god.
48237 ^ he
48238 ^ having gone - to pilate, asked [for] the body - of jesus.
48246 ^ and
48247 ^ having taken it down, he wrapped it in a linen cloth
48251 ^ and placed it in a tomb cut in a rock,
48257 ^ in which no had been no one not yet
48262 ^ laid.
48263 ^ and [the] day it was
48266 ^ of preparation,
48267 ^ and sabbath was just beginning.
48270 ^ having followed then, the women
48274 ^ who were
48276 ^ come out of - galilee with him, saw the tomb
48284 ^ and how was laid the body of him.
48290 ^ having returned then, they prepared spices and anointing oils.
48296 ^ and on the indeed
48299 ^ sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
48304 ^ the however
48306 ^ first [day] of the week, dawn very early, to the tomb they came,
48315 ^ bringing
48316 ^ that they had prepared spices.
48319 ^ they found then the stone
48323 ^ having been rolled away from the tomb.
48327 ^ having entered however, not they found the body of the lord jesus.
48336 ^ and it came to pass
48338 ^ while - are perplexed they about this,
48344 ^ that behold,
48346 ^ men two stood by them in garments
48352 ^ dazzling.
48353 ^ terrified then having become of them
48357 ^ and bowing the faces to the ground,
48364 ^ they said to them,
48367 ^ why seek you
48369 ^ the living among the dead?
48374 ^ not he is here,
48377 ^ but he is risen!
48379 ^ remember
48380 ^ how he spoke to you,
48383 ^ yet being in - galilee,
48388 ^ saying,
48389 ^ the son - of man - it behooves
48395 ^ to be delivered into hands of men sinful,
48400 ^ and to be crucified,
48402 ^ and the third day to arise.
48407 ^ and they remembered the words of him.
48412 ^ and
48413 ^ having returned from the tomb, they related these things all to the eleven and to all the rest.
48426 ^ it was now - magdalene mary, and joanna, and mary the [mother] of james, and the other women with them,
48442 ^ telling to the apostles these things.
48447 ^ and appeared before them like folly the words of them,
48456 ^ and they did not believe them.
48459 ^ - but
48461 ^ peter,
48462 ^ having risen up, ran to the tomb,
48467 ^ and
48468 ^ having stooped down, he sees the linen strips only,
48473 ^ and he went away, in himself
48477 ^ wondering at
48478 ^ that having come to pass.
48480 ^ and behold,
48482 ^ two of them on same the day were
48490 ^ going to a village
48493 ^ being distant, stadia sixty from jerusalem,
48498 ^ whose name [is] emmaus;
48501 ^ and they were talking with one another about all -
48509 ^ having taken place these things.
48511 ^ and it came to pass
48513 ^ in the talking of them
48517 ^ and reasoning,
48519 ^ that himself jesus,
48522 ^ having drawn near, was walking along with them;
48525 ^ - but
48527 ^ the eyes of them were held
48530 ^ - not
48532 ^ to know him.
48534 ^ he said then to them,
48538 ^ what - words [are] these
48542 ^ that you exchange with one another
48546 ^ walking?
48547 ^ and they stood still, looking sad.
48550 ^ answering now, [the] one named cleopas said to him,
48558 ^ you alone visit jerusalem
48562 ^ and not have known
48565 ^ the things having come to pass in it in the days these?
48573 ^ and he said to them,
48576 ^ what things?
48577 ^ - and they said to him,
48581 ^ the things concerning jesus of nazareth,
48586 ^ who was a man, a prophet mighty in deed and word before - god and all the people;
48602 ^ that then delivered up him the chief priests and the rulers of us to [the] judgment of death,
48615 ^ and crucified him.
48618 ^ we however were hoping
48621 ^ - he it is
48624 ^ who is about
48626 ^ to redeem - israel.
48629 ^ but indeed also with all these things, [the] third this day brings,
48639 ^ away from which these things came to pass.
48643 ^ however also women certain out from us astonished us.
48651 ^ having been early to the tomb
48656 ^ and not having found the body of him, they came
48663 ^ declaring
48664 ^ also a vision of angels to have seen,
48668 ^ who say
48670 ^ he is alive.
48672 ^ and went some of those with us to the tomb
48681 ^ and found [it] so,
48684 ^ as also the women said;
48689 ^ him however not they saw.
48693 ^ and he said to them,
48698 ^ o foolish and slow - of heart
48704 ^ - to believe in all
48708 ^ that have spoken the prophets. not
48713 ^ these things was it necessary for
48715 ^ to suffer the christ
48718 ^ and to enter into the glory of him?
48724 ^ and
48725 ^ having begun from moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.
48742 ^ and they drew near to the village
48747 ^ where they were going,
48749 ^ and he appeared
48752 ^ farther to be going.
48754 ^ and they constrained him,
48757 ^ saying,
48758 ^ abide with us,
48761 ^ for toward evening it is,
48765 ^ and has declined now the day.
48770 ^ and he entered in
48772 ^ - to abide with them.
48776 ^ and it came to pass
48778 ^ in the reclining of him with them,
48784 ^ having taken the bread he blessed [it],
48788 ^ and
48789 ^ having broken [it], he began giving [it] to them.
48792 ^ of them then were opened
48795 ^ the eyes,
48797 ^ and they knew him.
48800 ^ and he vanished being seen from them.
48806 ^ and they said to one another,
48810 ^ not the heart of us
48814 ^ burning was within us
48818 ^ as he was speaking with us on the road,
48824 ^ as he was opening to us the scriptures?
48829 ^ and
48830 ^ having risen up [that] same - hour, they returned to jerusalem,
48837 ^ and they found
48839 ^ gathered together the eleven and those with them,
48846 ^ saying
48847 ^ -, indeed has risen the lord
48852 ^ and he has appeared to simon.
48855 ^ and they began relating the things on the road,
48862 ^ and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.
48871 ^ these things now of them as they were telling, he himself stood in midst of them
48880 ^ and says to them,
48883 ^ peace to you.
48885 ^ having been terrified however,
48887 ^ and filled with fear having been, they were thinking [themselves]
48891 ^ a spirit to see.
48893 ^ and he said to them,
48896 ^ why
48897 ^ troubled are you,
48899 ^ and through why doubts do come up in the hearts of you?
48908 ^ see the hands of me and the feet of me,
48916 ^ that i am
48919 ^ he. touch me
48922 ^ and see,
48924 ^ for a spirit flesh and bones not has,
48931 ^ as me you see
48934 ^ having.
48935 ^ and
48936 ^ this having said, he showed to them the hands and the feet.
48945 ^ still now, while they were disbelieving of them for the joy
48952 ^ and amazement,
48954 ^ he said to them,
48956 ^ have you anything to eat here?
48960 ^ - and they gave to him of a fish broiled part.
48967 ^ and
48968 ^ having taken [it], before them he ate [it].
48972 ^ he said now unto to them,
48976 ^ these [are] the words of me,
48980 ^ which i spoke to you
48984 ^ still being with you,
48988 ^ that it behooves
48990 ^ to be fulfilled all things
48992 ^ - having been written in the law of moses, and the prophets and [the] psalms concerning me.
49005 ^ then he opened their - mind
49010 ^ - to understand the scriptures.
49014 ^ and he said to them
49017 ^ -, thus it has been written:
49020 ^ was to suffer the christ,
49023 ^ and to rise out from [the] dead the third day;
49030 ^ and to be proclaimed in the name of him repentance and forgiveness of sins to all - nations,
49044 ^ having begun from jerusalem.
49047 ^ you [are] witnesses of these things.
49050 ^ and behold,
49052 ^ i am sending the promise of the father of me upon you;
49061 ^ you however remain in the city
49067 ^ until that you should be clothed with from on high power.
49073 ^ he led now them out as far as to bethany,
49080 ^ and
49081 ^ having lifted up the hands of him, he blessed them.
49087 ^ and it came to pass
49089 ^ in the blessing of him them,
49094 ^ he was separated from them
49097 ^ and was carried up into - heaven.
49102 ^ and they
49104 ^ having worshiped him, returned to jerusalem with joy great,
49112 ^ and were
49114 ^ continually all in the temple, blessing - god.
49122 ^ in [the] beginning was the word,
49127 ^ and the word was with - god,
49134 ^ and god was the word.
49139 ^ he was in [the] beginning with - god.
49146 ^ all things through him came into being,
49150 ^ and without him came into being not even one [thing]
49156 ^ that has come into being.
49158 ^ in him life was,
49162 ^ and the life was the light - of men.
49170 ^ and the light in the darkness shines,
49177 ^ and the darkness it not overcame.
49183 ^ there came a man
49185 ^ having been sent from god;
49188 ^ [the] name to him [was] john.
49191 ^ he came as a witness,
49195 ^ that he might testify concerning the light,
49200 ^ that all might believe through him.
49205 ^ not was he the light,
49210 ^ but that he might witness concerning the light.
49216 ^ was the light - true,
49221 ^ who enlightens every man,
49225 ^ coming into the world.
49229 ^ in the world he was,
49233 ^ and the world through him came into being,
49239 ^ and the world him not knew.
49245 ^ to the own he came,
49249 ^ and the own him not received.
49255 ^ as many as however received him,
49259 ^ he gave to them authority
49262 ^ children of god to be,
49265 ^ to those believing in the name of him,
49271 ^ who not of blood, nor of will of flesh, nor of will of man,
49283 ^ but of god were born.
49287 ^ and the word flesh became
49292 ^ and dwelt among us,
49296 ^ and we beheld the glory of him, a glory as of an only begotten from [the] father, full of grace and truth.
49310 ^ john witnesses concerning him,
49314 ^ and he cried out,
49316 ^ saying,
49317 ^ this was he
49319 ^ of whom i was saying,
49321 ^ the [one] after me
49324 ^ coming, precedence over me has,
49328 ^ because before me he was.’
49332 ^ for from the fullness of him, we all have received
49340 ^ then grace for grace.
49344 ^ for the law through moses was given;
49350 ^ - grace and - truth through jesus christ came.
49359 ^ god no one has seen ever yet;
49363 ^ [the] only begotten god,
49365 ^ the [one] being in the bosom of the father,
49372 ^ he has made [him] known.
49374 ^ and this is the testimony - of john,
49381 ^ when sent to him the jews from jerusalem, priests and levites,
49392 ^ that they might ask him,
49395 ^ you, who are?
49398 ^ and he confessed
49400 ^ and not denied,
49403 ^ but confessed
49405 ^ -, i not am the christ.
49411 ^ and they asked him,
49414 ^ what then? you
49417 ^ elijah are?
49419 ^ and he says,
49421 ^ not i am.
49423 ^ the prophet are you?
49427 ^ and he answered,
49429 ^ no.
49430 ^ they said therefore to him,
49433 ^ who are you?
49435 ^ that an answer we might give
49438 ^ to those having sent us;
49441 ^ what say you about yourself?
49445 ^ he was saying,
49446 ^ i [am] a voice
49448 ^ crying in the wilderness,
49452 ^ make straight the way of [the] lord,’”
49456 ^ as said isaiah the prophet.
49461 ^ and
49462 ^ [those] having been sent were out from the pharisees.
49467 ^ and they asked him
49470 ^ and said to him,
49473 ^ why then baptize you,
49476 ^ if you not are the christ,
49482 ^ nor elijah,
49484 ^ nor the prophet?
49487 ^ answered them - john
49491 ^ saying,
49492 ^ i baptize with water;
49496 ^ but in [the] midst of you stands [one]
49499 ^ whom you not know,
49503 ^ the [one] after me
49506 ^ coming,
49507 ^ of whom not am i
49511 ^ worthy
49512 ^ that i should untie of him the strap
49517 ^ of the sandal.
49519 ^ these things in bethany took place, across the jordan,
49526 ^ where was - john
49530 ^ baptizing.
49531 ^ on the next day he sees - jesus
49536 ^ coming to him
49539 ^ and says,
49541 ^ behold
49542 ^ the lamb - of god,
49546 ^ - taking away the sin of the world.
49552 ^ he it is
49554 ^ concerning whom i said,
49558 ^ after me comes a man,
49562 ^ who precedence over me has,
49566 ^ because before me he was.
49570 ^ and i not knew him;
49574 ^ but that he might be revealed - to israel,
49579 ^ because of this, came i
49583 ^ with water baptizing.
49586 ^ and bore witness john
49589 ^ saying
49590 ^ -, i have beheld the spirit,
49594 ^ descending as a dove out of heaven,
49599 ^ and it remained upon him.
49603 ^ and i not knew him;
49607 ^ but
49608 ^ the [one] having sent me
49611 ^ to baptize with water,
49614 ^ he to me said,
49617 ^ upon whom - you shall see the spirit
49623 ^ descending
49624 ^ and abiding on him,
49628 ^ he is
49630 ^ the [one] baptizing with [the] spirit holy.
49635 ^ and i have seen
49637 ^ and have borne witness
49639 ^ that this is the son - of god.
49646 ^ on the next day again was standing - john,
49652 ^ and of the disciples of him two.
49658 ^ and
49659 ^ having looked at - jesus
49662 ^ walking, he says,
49664 ^ behold
49665 ^ the lamb - of god!
49669 ^ and heard the two disciples him
49675 ^ speaking,
49676 ^ and followed - jesus.
49680 ^ having turned then - jesus,
49684 ^ and having beheld them
49687 ^ following, he says to them,
49690 ^ what seek you?
49692 ^ - and they said to him,
49696 ^ rabbi
49697 ^ which is to say,
49699 ^ being translated, teacher — where are you staying?
49703 ^ he says to them,
49705 ^ come
49706 ^ and you will see.
49708 ^ they went therefore
49710 ^ and saw
49712 ^ where he abides;
49714 ^ and with him they stayed the day that.
49721 ^ [the] hour was about [the] tenth.
49725 ^ was andrew, the brother of simon peter, one of the two
49735 ^ - having heard from john,
49739 ^ and having followed him.
49742 ^ finds he first the brother - own simon,
49750 ^ and he says to him,
49753 ^ we have found the messiah,
49756 ^ which is
49758 ^ translated christ.
49760 ^ he led him to - jesus.
49765 ^ having looked at him, - jesus said,
49770 ^ you are simon the son of john;
49776 ^ you will be called cephas
49779 ^ which means peter.
49782 ^ on the next day he desired
49785 ^ to go forth into - galilee.
49789 ^ and he finds philip.
49792 ^ and says to him - jesus,
49797 ^ follow me.
49799 ^ was now - philip from bethsaida, from the city of andrew and peter.
49811 ^ finds philip - nathanael
49815 ^ and says to him,
49818 ^ [him] whom wrote of moses in the law,
49824 ^ also the prophets, we have found,
49828 ^ jesus son - of joseph, - of nazareth.
49835 ^ and said to him nathanael,
49839 ^ out of nazareth is able any good thing to be?
49845 ^ says to him - philip,
49849 ^ come
49850 ^ and see.
49852 ^ saw - jesus - nathanael
49857 ^ coming to him,
49860 ^ and he says concerning him,
49864 ^ behold
49865 ^ truly an israelite,
49867 ^ in whom deceit not there is.
49872 ^ says to him nathanael,
49875 ^ from where me know you?
49878 ^ answered jesus
49880 ^ and said to him,
49883 ^ before - you philip
49887 ^ calling,
49888 ^ being under the fig tree, i saw you.
49894 ^ answered him nathanael,
49897 ^ rabbi, you are the son - of god;
49904 ^ you king are
49907 ^ - of israel.
49909 ^ answered jesus
49911 ^ and said to him,
49914 ^ because i said to you
49917 ^ that i saw you under the fig tree,
49923 ^ believe you?
49924 ^ greater things than these you will see.
49927 ^ and he says to him,
49930 ^ truly, truly, i say to all of you,
49934 ^ you will see the heaven
49937 ^ opened and the angels - of god
49943 ^ ascending
49944 ^ and descending on the son - of man.”
49951 ^ and on the day - third a wedding took place in cana - of galilee,
49962 ^ and was the mother - of jesus there.
49969 ^ was invited then also - jesus and the disciples of him to the wedding.
49981 ^ and having been deficient of wine,
49984 ^ says the mother - of jesus to him,
49991 ^ wine not they have.
49994 ^ and says to her - jesus,
49999 ^ what to me and to you, woman?
50004 ^ not yet is come the hour of me.
50009 ^ says the mother of him to the servants,
50015 ^ whatever anyhow - he may say to you, do.
50021 ^ there were now
50023 ^ there of stone, water jars six, according to the purification of the jews, standing,
50033 ^ having space for metretae two or three.
50039 ^ says to them - jesus,
50043 ^ fill the jars with water.
50047 ^ and they filled them up to [the] brim.
50052 ^ and he says to them,
50055 ^ draw out now
50057 ^ and carry to the master of the feast.
50061 ^ - and they carried [it].
50064 ^ when then had tasted the master of the feast the water
50071 ^ wine having become,
50073 ^ and not he knew
50076 ^ from where it is —
50078 ^ the however
50080 ^ servants knew
50082 ^ - having drawn the water —
50086 ^ calls the bridegroom the master of the feast
50091 ^ and says to him,
50094 ^ every man first the good wine sets out,
50101 ^ and when they might have drunk freely,
50104 ^ the inferior;
50106 ^ you have kept the good wine until now.
50113 ^ this did, [the] beginning of the signs, - jesus in cana - of galilee,
50124 ^ and he revealed the glory of him,
50129 ^ and believed in him the disciples of him.
50136 ^ after this he went down to capernaum, he
50142 ^ and the mother of him and the brothers of him and the disciples of him,
50154 ^ and there they stayed not many days.
50160 ^ and near was the passover of the jews,
50167 ^ and went up to jerusalem - jesus.
50173 ^ and he found in the temple
50178 ^ those selling oxen and sheep and doves,
50185 ^ and the money changers sitting.
50189 ^ and
50190 ^ having made a whip of cords, all he drove out from the temple,
50199 ^ - both sheep and - oxen;
50205 ^ and
50206 ^ of the money changers he poured out
50209 ^ the coins,
50211 ^ and the tables he overthrew.
50215 ^ and
50216 ^ to those - doves
50219 ^ selling he said,
50221 ^ take these things from here;
50224 ^ not make the house of the father of me a house of trade.
50233 ^ remembered the disciples of him
50237 ^ that
50238 ^ written it is:
50240 ^ the zeal of the house of you will consume me.”
50247 ^ answered therefore the jews
50251 ^ and said to him,
50254 ^ what sign show you to us,
50258 ^ that these things you do?
50261 ^ answered jesus
50263 ^ and said to them,
50266 ^ destroy the temple this,
50270 ^ and in three days i will raise up it.
50276 ^ said therefore the jews,
50280 ^ forty and six years was built the temple this,
50288 ^ and you in three days will raise up it?
50295 ^ he however was speaking concerning the temple of the body of him.
50304 ^ when therefore he was raised up out from [the] dead,
50309 ^ remembered the disciples of him
50313 ^ that this he had said,
50316 ^ and they believed the scripture and the word
50323 ^ that had spoken - jesus.
50327 ^ when then he was in - jerusalem in the passover, in the feast,
50339 ^ many believed in the name of him,
50345 ^ beholding of him the signs
50349 ^ that he was doing.
50351 ^ on his part however
50353 ^ jesus not did entrust himself to them,
50358 ^ because of - his
50361 ^ knowing all [men],
50363 ^ and because no need he had
50368 ^ that anyone should testify concerning the man;
50374 ^ he himself for knew
50377 ^ what was in the man.
50382 ^ there was now a man of the pharisees, nicodemus name to him, a ruler of the jews;
50394 ^ he came to him by night
50399 ^ and said to him,
50402 ^ rabbi, we know
50404 ^ that from god you have come, a teacher;
50409 ^ no one for is able
50412 ^ these - signs to do
50416 ^ that you do,
50419 ^ if not should be - god with him.
50426 ^ answered jesus
50428 ^ and said to him,
50431 ^ truly, truly i say to you,
50435 ^ if not anyone be born from above,
50440 ^ not he is able
50442 ^ to see the kingdom - of god.”
50447 ^ says to him - nicodemus,
50452 ^ how is able a man
50455 ^ to be born,
50456 ^ old being?
50458 ^ not is he able
50460 ^ into the womb of the mother of him a second time to enter,
50468 ^ and to be born?
50470 ^ answered jesus,
50472 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
50476 ^ if not anyone be born of water and of [the] spirit,
50484 ^ not he is able
50486 ^ to enter into the kingdom - of god.
50492 ^ that having been born of the flesh, flesh is;
50499 ^ and
50500 ^ that having been born of the spirit, spirit is.
50507 ^ not do wonder
50509 ^ that i said to you,
50512 ^ it is necessary for
50513 ^ you [all] to be born from above.
50516 ^ the wind
50518 ^ where it wishes blows,
50521 ^ and the sound of it you hear,
50526 ^ but not you know
50529 ^ from where it comes,
50531 ^ and where it goes;
50534 ^ thus is
50536 ^ everyone - having been born of the spirit.
50542 ^ answered nicodemus
50544 ^ and said to him,
50547 ^ how are able
50549 ^ these things to be?
50551 ^ answered jesus
50553 ^ and said to him,
50556 ^ you are the teacher - of israel,
50562 ^ and these things not know?
50566 ^ truly, truly, i say to you
50570 ^ that
50571 ^ what we know we speak,
50574 ^ and
50575 ^ what we have seen we bear witness to;
50578 ^ and the witness of us not you people receive.
50584 ^ if things earthly i have told you,
50589 ^ and not you believe,
50592 ^ how
50593 ^ if i tell to you the things heavenly, will you believe?
50599 ^ and no one has gone up into - heaven
50605 ^ if not
50607 ^ the [one] out of - heaven
50611 ^ having come down, the son - of man.
50616 ^ and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,
50625 ^ thus
50626 ^ to be lifted up it behooves the son - of man,
50632 ^ so that
50633 ^ everyone - believing in him may have life eternal.
50641 ^ thus for loved - god the world,
50648 ^ that the son, the only begotten, he gave,
50654 ^ so that
50655 ^ everyone - believing in him not should perish,
50662 ^ but should have life eternal.
50666 ^ not for sent - god - his son into the world
50676 ^ that he might judge the world,
50680 ^ but that might be saved the world through him.
50687 ^ the [one] believing on him not is judged;
50693 ^ the [one] but not believing already has been judged,
50699 ^ because not he has believed in the name of the only begotten son - of god.
50710 ^ this now is the judgement,
50715 ^ that the light has come into the world,
50722 ^ and loved - men rather the darkness
50729 ^ than the light;
50732 ^ were for of them evil
50736 ^ the deeds.
50738 ^ everyone for - evil
50742 ^ practicing hates the light
50746 ^ and not comes to the light,
50752 ^ so that not may be exposed the works of him;
50758 ^ the [one] however practicing the truth comes to the light,
50767 ^ that may be manifest his - works
50772 ^ that
50773 ^ in god have been done.”
50777 ^ after these things came - jesus and the disciples of him into the judean land,
50790 ^ and there he was staying with them,
50795 ^ and was baptizing.
50797 ^ was now also - john
50802 ^ baptizing in aenon, near - salim,
50808 ^ because waters many were there,
50813 ^ and they were coming
50815 ^ and being baptized.
50817 ^ not yet for had been
50820 ^ cast into the prison - john.
50826 ^ arose then a debate among the disciples of john, with [a certain] jew, about purification.
50837 ^ and they came to - john
50842 ^ and said to him,
50845 ^ rabbi,
50846 ^ he who was with you beyond the jordan,
50853 ^ to whom you have borne witness,
50856 ^ behold
50857 ^ he baptizes,
50859 ^ and all are coming to him.
50864 ^ answered john
50866 ^ and said,
50868 ^ nothing is able a man
50871 ^ to receive, nothing one
50874 ^ if not it is
50877 ^ given to him from - heaven.
50882 ^ yourselves you to me bear witness,
50886 ^ that i said,
50888 ^ - not am i the christ,
50894 ^ but -
50896 ^ sent i am before him.
50900 ^ the [one] having the bride, [the] bridegroom is;
50906 ^ the now
50908 ^ friend of the bridegroom,
50911 ^ the [one] standing
50913 ^ and listening for him, with joy rejoices because of the voice of the bridegroom.
50923 ^ this therefore,
50925 ^ the joy - of mine, is fulfilled.
50930 ^ him it behooves
50932 ^ to increase;
50933 ^ me however to decrease.
50936 ^ the [one] from above
50938 ^ coming, above all is.
50942 ^ the [one] being from the earth, from the earth is,
50951 ^ and from the earth speaks.
50956 ^ the [one] from - heaven
50960 ^ coming, above all is.
50964 ^ what he has seen
50966 ^ and heard,
50968 ^ this he testifies;
50970 ^ and the testimony of him, no one receives.
50976 ^ the [one] having received his - testimony has set his seal
50982 ^ that - god true is.
50987 ^ he whom for sent - god, the words - of god speaks,
50997 ^ not for by measure he gives the spirit.
51004 ^ the father loves the son,
51009 ^ and all things has given into the hand of him.
51016 ^ the [one] believing in the son has life eternal;
51024 ^ the [one] however not obeying the son, not will see life,
51032 ^ but the wrath - of god abides on him.”
51040 ^ when therefore knew - jesus
51045 ^ that heard the pharisees
51049 ^ that jesus more disciples makes
51054 ^ and baptizes
51056 ^ than john
51058 ^ although indeed jesus himself not was baptizing,
51063 ^ but the disciples of him
51067 ^ he left - judea,
51070 ^ and went away again into - galilee.
51076 ^ it was necessary for now
51078 ^ him to pass through - samaria.
51083 ^ he comes therefore to a city - of samaria
51089 ^ called sychar, near the plot of ground
51094 ^ that had given jacob to joseph, the son of him.
51102 ^ was now there [the] well - of jacob.
51108 ^ - therefore
51110 ^ jesus,
51111 ^ being wearied from the journey, was sitting thus at the well.
51120 ^ [the] hour was about [the] sixth.
51124 ^ comes a woman out of - samaria
51129 ^ to draw water.
51131 ^ says to her - jesus,
51135 ^ give me
51137 ^ to drink.
51138 ^ - for
51140 ^ the disciples of him had gone away into the city,
51146 ^ that food they might buy.
51149 ^ says therefore to him the woman - samaritan,
51156 ^ how you
51158 ^ a jew being, from me
51162 ^ to drink do ask,
51164 ^ a woman samaritan being?
51167 ^ not for have association jews with samaritans.
51172 ^ answered jesus
51174 ^ and said to her,
51177 ^ if you had known the gift - of god,
51183 ^ and who it is
51186 ^ - saying to you,
51189 ^ give me
51191 ^ to drink,
51192 ^ you - would have asked him,
51196 ^ and he would have given - to you water
51201 ^ living.
51202 ^ says to him the woman
51206 ^ sir, nothing to draw with you have,
51210 ^ and the well is deep;
51215 ^ from where then have you the water
51220 ^ - living?
51222 ^ not you greater than are
51226 ^ the father of us jacob,
51230 ^ who gave us the well,
51235 ^ and himself of it drank,
51240 ^ and the sons of him, and the livestock of him?
51248 ^ answered jesus
51250 ^ and said to her,
51253 ^ everyone - drinking of the water this will thirst again;
51262 ^ whoever however - may drink of the water
51269 ^ that i will give him, never not will thirst, to the age.
51279 ^ instead, the water
51282 ^ that i will give to him will become in him a spring of water,
51290 ^ welling up into life eternal.
51294 ^ says to him the woman,
51299 ^ sir, give me this - water,
51305 ^ that not i might thirst,
51308 ^ nor come here
51311 ^ to draw.
51312 ^ he says to her,
51314 ^ go,
51315 ^ call the husband of you
51319 ^ and come here.
51322 ^ answered the woman
51325 ^ and said to him
51328 ^ not i have a husband.
51331 ^ says to her - jesus,
51335 ^ correctly you have spoken
51337 ^ -, a husband not i have.
51341 ^ five for
51343 ^ husbands you have had,
51345 ^ and now
51347 ^ he whom you have, not is your husband;
51353 ^ this truly you have spoken.
51356 ^ says to him the woman,
51360 ^ sir, i understand
51362 ^ that a prophet are you.
51366 ^ the fathers of us on the mountain this worshiped,
51374 ^ and you say
51377 ^ that in jerusalem is the place
51383 ^ where
51384 ^ to worship it is necessary.
51386 ^ says to her - jesus,
51390 ^ believe me, woman,
51393 ^ that is coming an hour
51396 ^ when neither on the mountain this, nor in jerusalem, will you worship the father.
51408 ^ you worship
51410 ^ what not you know;
51413 ^ we worship
51415 ^ what we know,
51417 ^ for - salvation of the jews is.
51424 ^ but is coming an hour
51427 ^ and now is,
51430 ^ when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and truth;
51441 ^ also for the father such seeks,
51447 ^ who worship him.
51450 ^ spirit - god [is],
51453 ^ and
51454 ^ those worshiping him in spirit and truth it behooves
51462 ^ to worship.
51463 ^ says to him the woman,
51467 ^ i know
51468 ^ that messiah is coming,
51471 ^ who is called christ;
51474 ^ when comes he,
51477 ^ he will tell us all things.
51480 ^ says to her - jesus,
51484 ^ i am [he],
51486 ^ the [one] speaking to you.
51489 ^ and upon this came the disciples of him,
51496 ^ and were amazed
51498 ^ that with a woman he was speaking;
51502 ^ no one however said,
51505 ^ what seek you?
51507 ^ or why speak you with her?
51512 ^ left then the water pot of her the woman,
51519 ^ and went away into the city,
51524 ^ and says to the men,
51528 ^ come,
51529 ^ see a man
51531 ^ who told me all things
51535 ^ whatever i did.
51537 ^ can it be [that] this is the christ?
51542 ^ they went forth out of the city
51546 ^ and were coming unto him.
51550 ^ but in the meantime were asking him the disciples,
51557 ^ saying,
51558 ^ rabbi, eat.
51560 ^ - but he said to them,
51564 ^ i food have
51567 ^ to eat
51568 ^ that you not know.
51572 ^ were saying therefore the disciples to one another,
51578 ^ no one did bring him
51582 ^ [anything] to eat?
51583 ^ says to them - jesus,
51587 ^ my food is
51590 ^ that i should do the will
51594 ^ of the [one] having sent me,
51597 ^ and should finish of him the work.
51602 ^ not you say
51605 ^ that yet four months it is,
51609 ^ and the harvest comes?
51613 ^ behold,
51614 ^ i say to you,
51616 ^ lift up the eyes of you
51620 ^ and see the fields,
51624 ^ because white they are toward harvest
51629 ^ already!
51630 ^ the [one] reaping a reward receives
51634 ^ and gathers fruit unto life eternal,
51640 ^ so that
51641 ^ the [one] sowing together may rejoice,
51645 ^ and the [one] reaping.
51648 ^ in for
51650 ^ this the saying is true
51655 ^ -, one is
51658 ^ - sowing,
51660 ^ and another
51662 ^ - reaping.
51664 ^ i sent you
51667 ^ to reap
51668 ^ what not you have toiled for;
51672 ^ others have toiled,
51674 ^ and you into the labor of them have entered.
51681 ^ out of now
51683 ^ the city that, many believed in him
51690 ^ of the samaritans, because of the word of the woman
51697 ^ testifying
51698 ^ -, he told me all things
51702 ^ whatever i did.
51704 ^ when therefore came to him the samaritans,
51711 ^ they were asking him
51713 ^ to abide with them,
51716 ^ and he stayed there two days.
51721 ^ and many more believed, because of the word of him;
51729 ^ - and
51731 ^ to the woman they were saying
51733 ^ -, no longer because of - your speech we believe;
51740 ^ we ourselves for have heard,
51743 ^ and we know
51745 ^ that this is truly the savior of the world.
51753 ^ after then
51755 ^ the two days, he went forth from there into - galilee.
51763 ^ himself for
51765 ^ jesus testified
51767 ^ that a prophet in the own hometown, honor not has.
51776 ^ when therefore he came into - galilee,
51782 ^ received him the galileans,
51786 ^ all things having seen
51788 ^ how great he had done in jerusalem during the feast;
51795 ^ also themselves for they had gone to the feast.
51802 ^ he came therefore again to - cana - of galilee,
51810 ^ where he had made the water wine.
51815 ^ and there was a certain royal official
51819 ^ whose - son was sick in capernaum.
51825 ^ he,
51826 ^ having heard
51827 ^ that jesus had come out of - judea into - galilee, went to him
51839 ^ and was asking
51841 ^ that he would come down
51843 ^ and heal his - son;
51848 ^ he was about for
51850 ^ to die.
51851 ^ said therefore - jesus to him,
51857 ^ if not signs and wonders you people see,
51863 ^ no not will you believe.
51866 ^ says to him the royal official,
51871 ^ sir,
51872 ^ come down
51873 ^ before dies the child of me.
51878 ^ says to him - jesus,
51882 ^ go,
51883 ^ the son of you lives.
51887 ^ believed the man the word
51892 ^ that said to him - jesus,
51897 ^ and he went on his way.
51899 ^ already then [as] he is going down,
51903 ^ the servants of him met him,
51908 ^ saying
51909 ^ that the boy of him lives.
51914 ^ he inquired therefore the hour from them
51920 ^ in which better he got.
51924 ^ they said therefore to him
51927 ^ -, yesterday [at the] hour seventh, left him the fever.
51935 ^ knew therefore the father
51939 ^ that [it was] in that the hour
51944 ^ at which said to him - jesus,
51950 ^ the son of you lives.
51954 ^ and he believed himself,
51957 ^ and the household of him all.
51962 ^ this [is] now again [the] second sign did - jesus,
51970 ^ having come out of - judea into - galilee.
51977 ^ after these things there was a feast of the jews,
51983 ^ and went up jesus to jerusalem.
51988 ^ there is now in - jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool,
51997 ^ - called in hebrew bethesda,
52001 ^ five porches having.
52004 ^ in these were lying a multitude
52008 ^ of those ailing, blind, lame, paralyzed.
52013 ^ was now a certain man there,
52018 ^ thirty and eight years being in - infirmity himself.
52027 ^ him having seen - jesus
52031 ^ lying,
52032 ^ and having known
52034 ^ that a long already
52037 ^ time he has been, he says to him,
52041 ^ desire you
52042 ^ well to become?
52044 ^ answered him
52046 ^ the [one] ailing,
52048 ^ sir, a man not i have,
52052 ^ that when has been stirred the water,
52057 ^ he might put me into the pool,
52062 ^ in which now am going i, another before me descends.
52071 ^ says to him - jesus,
52075 ^ arise,
52076 ^ take up the mat of you,
52080 ^ and walk.
52082 ^ and immediately became well the man,
52088 ^ and he took up the mat of him
52093 ^ and began to walk.
52095 ^ it was now sabbath on that - day.
52102 ^ were saying therefore the jews
52106 ^ to the [one] having been healed,
52108 ^ sabbath it is,
52110 ^ and not it is lawful for you
52114 ^ to take up the mat of you,
52118 ^ who however answered them,
52122 ^ the [one] having made me well,
52126 ^ that one to me said,
52129 ^ take up the mat of you
52133 ^ and walk.
52135 ^ they asked him,
52137 ^ who is the man
52141 ^ - having said to you,
52144 ^ take up
52145 ^ and walk?’
52147 ^ the [one] now having been healed not knew
52152 ^ who it is,
52154 ^ - for
52156 ^ jesus had moved away,
52158 ^ a crowd being in the place.
52163 ^ after these things finds him - jesus in the temple
52172 ^ and said to him,
52175 ^ behold,
52176 ^ well you have become;
52178 ^ no more sin,
52180 ^ that not worse to you
52184 ^ something happens.
52186 ^ went away the man
52189 ^ and told the jews
52193 ^ that jesus it is
52196 ^ the [one] having made him well.
52200 ^ and because of this, were persecuting the jews - jesus,
52208 ^ because these things he was doing on [the] sabbath.
52213 ^ - but
52215 ^ jesus answered them,
52218 ^ the father of me until now is working,
52224 ^ and i am working.
52226 ^ because of this therefore, the more were seeking
52231 ^ him the jews to kill,
52235 ^ because not only was he breaking the sabbath,
52241 ^ but also father his own he was calling - god,
52248 ^ equal himself making
52251 ^ to god.
52253 ^ answered therefore - jesus
52257 ^ and was saying to them,
52260 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
52264 ^ not is able the son
52268 ^ to do of himself nothing,
52272 ^ if not
52274 ^ anything he might see
52276 ^ the father
52278 ^ doing;
52279 ^ whatever for - he does,
52284 ^ these things also the son likewise does.
52290 ^ - for
52292 ^ the father loves the son,
52296 ^ and all things shows to him
52300 ^ that he does;
52303 ^ and greater than these he will show him
52308 ^ works,
52309 ^ so that you may marvel.
52312 ^ even as for the father raises up the dead
52319 ^ and gives life,
52321 ^ thus also the son
52325 ^ to whom he will, gives life.
52328 ^ not even for the father judges no one,
52334 ^ but - judgment all has given to the son,
52341 ^ so that all may honor the son,
52346 ^ even as they honor the father.
52350 ^ he who not
52352 ^ is honoring the son, not is honoring the father,
52359 ^ the [one] having sent him.
52362 ^ truly, truly i say to you
52366 ^ that
52367 ^ the [one] the word of me
52371 ^ hearing,
52372 ^ and believing
52374 ^ the [one] having sent me, he has life eternal
52380 ^ and into judgment not comes,
52385 ^ but has passed out of - death into - life.
52393 ^ truly, truly, i say to you
52397 ^ that is coming an hour,
52400 ^ and now is,
52403 ^ when the dead will hear the voice of the son - of god,
52413 ^ and
52414 ^ those having heard will live.
52417 ^ as for the father has life in himself,
52425 ^ so also to the son he gave
52430 ^ life, to have in himself.
52434 ^ and authority he gave him
52438 ^ judgment to execute,
52440 ^ because son of man he is.
52444 ^ not marvel at this,
52447 ^ for is coming an hour
52450 ^ in which all those in the tombs will hear the voice of him,
52461 ^ and will come forth —
52463 ^ those - good
52466 ^ having done, to [the] resurrection of life;
52470 ^ - and those evil having done, to [the] resurrection of judgment.
52478 ^ not am able i
52481 ^ to do of myself nothing;
52485 ^ as i hear,
52487 ^ i judge;
52488 ^ and the judgment - of me just is,
52495 ^ because not i seek the will - of me,
52502 ^ but the will
52505 ^ of the [one] having sent me.
52508 ^ if i bear witness concerning myself,
52513 ^ the testimony of me not is true.
52519 ^ another it is
52521 ^ - bearing witness concerning me,
52525 ^ and i know
52527 ^ that true is the testimony
52532 ^ which he bears witness concerning me.
52536 ^ you have sent unto john
52540 ^ and he has borne witness to the truth.
52544 ^ i now not from man the testimony receive,
52552 ^ but these things i say
52555 ^ that you may be saved.
52558 ^ he was the lamp
52562 ^ - burning
52564 ^ and shining;
52566 ^ you now were willing
52569 ^ to rejoice for a season in the light of him.
52576 ^ i however have the testimony greater than that of john.
52584 ^ - for
52586 ^ the works
52587 ^ that has given me the father
52592 ^ that i should complete them,
52595 ^ same the works
52598 ^ which i do, bear witness concerning me
52603 ^ that the father me has sent.
52608 ^ and the [one]
52610 ^ having sent me, [the] father
52613 ^ himself, has borne witness concerning me.
52617 ^ neither voice of him at any time have you heard,
52622 ^ nor form of him have you seen.
52626 ^ and the word of him not you have
52632 ^ in you abiding;
52635 ^ for whom sent he,
52639 ^ him you not believe.
52643 ^ you diligently search the scriptures,
52646 ^ for you think
52649 ^ in them life eternal to have;
52654 ^ and these are they
52657 ^ - bearing witness concerning me;
52661 ^ and not you are willing
52664 ^ to come to me
52667 ^ that life you may have.
52670 ^ glory from men not i take;
52675 ^ but i have known you,
52678 ^ that the love - of god not you have in yourselves.
52687 ^ i have come in the name of the father of me,
52695 ^ and not you receive me;
52699 ^ if another should come in the name the own,
52707 ^ him you will receive.
52709 ^ how are able you
52712 ^ to believe,
52713 ^ glory from one another receiving,
52717 ^ and the glory that [is] from the only god, not you seek?
52727 ^ not think
52729 ^ that i will accuse you to the father.
52736 ^ there is
52737 ^ [one] accusing you, moses,
52741 ^ in whom you have hoped.
52745 ^ if for you were believing moses,
52749 ^ you would have believed - me;
52752 ^ concerning for
52754 ^ me he wrote.
52757 ^ if now - his writings not you believe,
52764 ^ how - my words will you believe?
52769 ^ after these things went away - jesus over the sea - of galilee — - of tiberias.
52781 ^ was following now him a crowd great,
52786 ^ because they were seeing the signs
52790 ^ which he was doing
52792 ^ upon those being sick.
52795 ^ went up now on the mountain jesus,
52801 ^ and there he was sitting with the disciples of him.
52808 ^ was now near the passover, the feast of the jews.
52817 ^ having lifted up then
52819 ^ the eyes - jesus
52823 ^ and having seen
52825 ^ that a great crowd is coming to him, he says to philip,
52834 ^ from where shall we buy bread
52837 ^ that might eat these?
52840 ^ this now he was saying
52843 ^ testing him;
52845 ^ he for knew
52848 ^ what he was about to do.
52851 ^ answered him - philip,
52855 ^ two hundred denarii worth of loaves not are sufficient for them
52861 ^ that each little [piece] one might receive.
52866 ^ says to him one of the disciples of him, andrew, the brother of simon peter,
52878 ^ is a little boy here,
52881 ^ who has five loaves barley and two small fish;
52889 ^ but these what are for so many?
52895 ^ said - jesus,
52898 ^ make the men
52901 ^ to recline.
52902 ^ there was now grass much in the place.
52909 ^ reclined therefore the men, the number about five thousand.
52917 ^ took then the loaves - jesus,
52923 ^ and
52924 ^ having given thanks, he distributed
52926 ^ to those reclining;
52928 ^ likewise also
52930 ^ of the fish, as much as they wished.
52935 ^ when now they were filled,
52938 ^ he says to the disciples of him,
52942 ^ gather together the
52944 ^ having been over and above fragments,
52946 ^ so that nothing anything may be lost.
52950 ^ they gathered together therefore,
52952 ^ and filled twelve hand-baskets of fragments from the five loaves - barley
52963 ^ which were over and above
52965 ^ to those having eaten.
52967 ^ the therefore
52969 ^ people,
52970 ^ having seen
52971 ^ what he had done, [the] sign, were saying
52975 ^ -, this is truly the prophet
52981 ^ who is coming into the world.
52986 ^ jesus therefore,
52988 ^ having known
52989 ^ that they are about
52991 ^ to come
52992 ^ and to seize him
52995 ^ that they might make [him] king, withdrew again to the mountain
53003 ^ himself alone.
53005 ^ when now evening it became,
53009 ^ went down the disciples of him to the sea,
53016 ^ and
53017 ^ having entered into a boat, they were going over the sea to capernaum.
53026 ^ and dark already it had become,
53030 ^ and not had come to them - jesus.
53037 ^ - and
53039 ^ the sea
53040 ^ by a wind strong blowing was agitated.
53044 ^ having rowed therefore about stadia twenty five or thirty, they see - jesus
53055 ^ walking on the sea,
53059 ^ and near the boat coming,
53064 ^ and they were frightened.
53066 ^ - and he says to them,
53070 ^ i am [he];
53072 ^ not fear.
53074 ^ they were willing then
53076 ^ to receive him into the boat,
53081 ^ and immediately was the boat at the land
53089 ^ to which they were going.
53092 ^ on the next day the crowd
53096 ^ - standing on the other side of the sea, having seen
53102 ^ that boat other no was there
53108 ^ if not one,
53111 ^ and that not went with the disciples of him - jesus into the boat,
53123 ^ but alone the disciples of him went away;
53129 ^ but other came boats from tiberias, near the place
53137 ^ where they ate the bread,
53141 ^ having given thanks the lord.
53144 ^ when therefore saw the crowd
53149 ^ that jesus not is there,
53154 ^ nor the disciples of him,
53158 ^ they entered themselves into the boats
53163 ^ and came to capernaum,
53167 ^ seeking - jesus.
53170 ^ and having found him on the other side of the sea,
53176 ^ they said to him,
53178 ^ rabbi, when here have you come?
53182 ^ answered them - jesus
53186 ^ and said,
53188 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
53192 ^ you seek me,
53194 ^ not because you saw signs,
53198 ^ but because you ate of the loaves
53204 ^ and were satisfied.
53206 ^ work not [for] the food
53210 ^ that is perishing,
53212 ^ but [for] the food
53215 ^ - enduring unto life eternal,
53220 ^ which the son - of man to you will give.
53227 ^ him for the father has sealed,
53232 ^ - god.
53234 ^ they said therefore to him,
53238 ^ what must we do,
53240 ^ that we may be doing the works - of god?
53246 ^ answered - jesus
53249 ^ and said to them,
53252 ^ this is the work - of god,
53258 ^ that you should believe
53260 ^ in him whom has sent he.
53264 ^ they said therefore to him,
53267 ^ what then do you
53271 ^ [as a] sign,
53272 ^ that we may see
53274 ^ and may believe you?
53277 ^ what work do you perform?
53279 ^ the fathers of us the manna ate in the wilderness,
53288 ^ as it is
53290 ^ written:
53291 ^ bread from - heaven he gave them
53297 ^ to eat.’
53298 ^ said therefore to them - jesus,
53303 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
53307 ^ not moses has given you the bread from - heaven,
53316 ^ but the father of me gives you the bread from - heaven
53327 ^ - true.
53329 ^ the for
53331 ^ bread - of god is
53335 ^ the [one] coming down out of - heaven
53340 ^ and life giving to the world.
53345 ^ they said therefore to him,
53349 ^ sir, always give to us the bread this.
53356 ^ said to them - jesus,
53360 ^ i am the bread - of life;
53366 ^ the [one] coming to me never not shall hunger,
53373 ^ and
53374 ^ the [one] believing in me no not shall thirst at any time.
53382 ^ but i said to you
53385 ^ that also you have seen me,
53389 ^ and yet not believe.
53392 ^ all
53393 ^ that gives me the father, to me will come,
53401 ^ and
53402 ^ the [one] coming to me, no not shall i cast out.
53410 ^ for i have come down from - heaven,
53415 ^ not that i should do the will - of me,
53422 ^ but the will
53425 ^ of the [one] having sent me.
53428 ^ this now is the will
53433 ^ of the [one] having sent me,
53436 ^ that all
53438 ^ that he has given me,
53441 ^ none i should lose of it,
53445 ^ but will raise up it in the last day.
53452 ^ this for is the will of the father of me,
53460 ^ that
53461 ^ everyone - beholding the son
53466 ^ and believing in him should have life eternal,
53473 ^ and will raise up him i in the last day.
53481 ^ were grumbling therefore the jews about him
53487 ^ because he said,
53489 ^ i am the bread
53493 ^ - having come down from - heaven.
53498 ^ and they were saying,
53500 ^ not this is jesus the son of joseph,
53507 ^ of whom we know
53510 ^ the father and the mother?
53515 ^ how then says he
53518 ^ -, from - heaven i have come down?
53523 ^ answered jesus
53525 ^ and said to them,
53528 ^ not grumble with one another.
53532 ^ no one is able
53534 ^ to come to me,
53537 ^ if not the father,
53541 ^ the [one] having sent me, draws him,
53546 ^ and i will raise up him in the last day.
53553 ^ it is
53554 ^ written in the prophets:
53558 ^ and they will be all taught of god.’
53563 ^ everyone - having heard from the father
53569 ^ and having learned, comes to me.
53574 ^ not that the father has seen anyone,
53580 ^ if not
53582 ^ the [one] being from - god;
53587 ^ he has seen the father.
53591 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
53595 ^ the [one] believing has life eternal.
53600 ^ i am the bread - of life.
53606 ^ the fathers of you ate in the wilderness the manna,
53615 ^ and died.
53617 ^ this is the bread
53621 ^ - from - heaven
53625 ^ coming down,
53626 ^ that anyone of it may eat,
53631 ^ and not die.
53634 ^ i am the bread
53638 ^ - living,
53640 ^ - from - heaven
53644 ^ having come down;
53645 ^ if anyone shall have eaten of this - bread,
53652 ^ he will live to the age;
53656 ^ and the bread also
53660 ^ that i will give, the flesh of me is
53667 ^ for the of the world life.
53672 ^ were arguing therefore with one another the jews,
53678 ^ saying,
53679 ^ how is able this [man]
53682 ^ us to give the flesh of him to eat?
53688 ^ said therefore to them - jesus,
53693 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
53697 ^ if not you shall have eaten the flesh of the son - of man,
53706 ^ and shall have drunk of him the blood,
53711 ^ not you have life in yourselves.
53716 ^ the [one] eating of me the flesh,
53721 ^ and drinking of me the blood, has life eternal,
53729 ^ and i will raise up him in the last day.
53735 ^ the for
53737 ^ flesh of me, true is
53741 ^ food,
53742 ^ and the blood of me, true is
53748 ^ drink.
53749 ^ the [one] eating of me the flesh
53754 ^ and drinking of me the blood, in me abides,
53762 ^ and i in him.
53765 ^ as sent me the
53769 ^ living father,
53771 ^ and i live because of the father,
53776 ^ also
53777 ^ the [one] feeding on me,
53780 ^ he also will live because of me.
53784 ^ this is the bread
53788 ^ - from heaven
53791 ^ having come down,
53792 ^ not as ate the fathers
53797 ^ and died.
53799 ^ the [one] eating this - bread will live to the age.
53808 ^ these things he said
53810 ^ in [the] synagogue, teaching in capernaum.
53815 ^ many therefore,
53817 ^ having heard,
53818 ^ of the disciples of him, said,
53823 ^ difficult is the word this;
53828 ^ who is able
53830 ^ it to hear?
53832 ^ knowing however - jesus
53836 ^ in himself
53838 ^ that are grumbling about this the disciples of him, he said to them,
53847 ^ this you does offend?
53850 ^ what if then you should see the son - of man
53857 ^ ascending
53858 ^ where he was - before?
53862 ^ the spirit it is
53865 ^ - giving life;
53867 ^ the flesh not profits nothing.
53872 ^ the words
53874 ^ that i speak to you spirit are,
53880 ^ and life they are.
53883 ^ but they are of you some
53888 ^ who not believe.
53891 ^ knew for from [the] beginning - jesus
53897 ^ who are
53899 ^ those not
53901 ^ believing
53902 ^ and who it is
53905 ^ who will betray him.
53908 ^ and he was saying,
53910 ^ because of this have i said to you
53914 ^ that no one is able
53917 ^ to come to me,
53920 ^ if not it shall
53923 ^ have been granted to him from the father.
53928 ^ from that [time], many out of the disciples of him departed to the back
53939 ^ and no longer with him walked.
53944 ^ said therefore - jesus to the twelve,
53950 ^ not also you are wishing
53954 ^ to go away?
53955 ^ answered him simon peter,
53959 ^ lord, to whom will we go?
53963 ^ [the] words of life eternal you have;
53967 ^ and we have believed
53970 ^ and have known
53972 ^ that you are the holy one - of god.
53979 ^ answered them - jesus,
53983 ^ not i you the twelve did choose,
53989 ^ and of you one a devil is?
53995 ^ he was speaking now - of judas [son] of simon iscariot;
54001 ^ he for was about
54004 ^ to betray him,
54006 ^ one of the twelve.
54010 ^ and after these things, was walking - jesus in - galilee;
54019 ^ not for he did desire
54022 ^ in - judea to walk,
54026 ^ because were seeking
54028 ^ him the jews to kill.
54032 ^ was now near the feast of the jews, of booths.
54041 ^ said therefore to him the brothers of him,
54048 ^ depart from here
54050 ^ and go into - judea,
54055 ^ so that also the disciples of you will see of you the works
54064 ^ that you are doing.
54066 ^ no one for anything in secret does
54072 ^ and seeks himself
54075 ^ in public to be.
54078 ^ if these things you do,
54081 ^ show yourself to the world.
54085 ^ not even for the brothers of him were believing in him.
54093 ^ says therefore to them - jesus,
54098 ^ the time - of me not yet is come,
54104 ^ - but
54106 ^ the time - of you always is ready.
54112 ^ not is able the world
54116 ^ to hate you;
54118 ^ me however it hates,
54121 ^ because i bear witness concerning it
54126 ^ that the works of it evil are.
54132 ^ you go up to the feast.
54137 ^ i not am going up to the feast this,
54144 ^ for - my time not yet has been fulfilled.
54150 ^ these things now having said to them, he remained in - galilee.
54158 ^ when however had gone up the brothers of him to the feast,
54167 ^ then also he went up,
54171 ^ not openly,
54173 ^ but as in secret.
54177 ^ the therefore
54179 ^ jews were seeking him at the feast
54185 ^ and were saying,
54187 ^ where is he?
54190 ^ and murmuring about him there was much among the crowds.
54199 ^ some indeed were saying
54202 ^ -, good he is.
54205 ^ others however were saying,
54208 ^ no,
54209 ^ but he deceives the people.
54213 ^ no one however publicly was speaking about him, because of the fear of the jews.
54224 ^ now also of the feast being in the middle,
54229 ^ went up jesus into the temple
54234 ^ and was teaching.
54236 ^ were marveling then the jews,
54240 ^ saying,
54241 ^ how this one writings knows,
54245 ^ not having studied?
54247 ^ answered therefore them - jesus
54252 ^ and said
54254 ^ -, my teaching not is of myself,
54260 ^ but
54261 ^ of the [one] having sent me.
54264 ^ if anyone desires
54267 ^ the will of him to do,
54271 ^ he will know concerning the teaching,
54275 ^ whether from - god it is,
54280 ^ or i from myself speak.
54285 ^ the [one] from himself
54288 ^ speaking, the glory the own seeks;
54294 ^ the [one] however seeking the glory
54299 ^ of the [one] having sent him,
54302 ^ he true is,
54305 ^ and unrighteousness in him not is.
54311 ^ not moses has given to you the law,
54317 ^ and no one of you keeps the law?
54324 ^ why
54325 ^ me do you seek to kill?
54328 ^ answered the crowd,
54331 ^ a demon you have;
54333 ^ who
54334 ^ you seeks to kill?
54337 ^ answered jesus
54339 ^ and said to them,
54342 ^ one work i did,
54345 ^ and all you marvel.
54348 ^ because of the fact that moses has given you - circumcision —
54355 ^ not that of - moses it is,
54361 ^ but of the fathers —
54365 ^ also on sabbath you circumcise a man.
54370 ^ if circumcision receives a man on sabbath
54376 ^ so that not might be broken the law of moses,
54382 ^ with me are you angry
54384 ^ because entirely a man sound i made on the sabbath?
54391 ^ not judge according to appearance,
54395 ^ but the righteous judgment judge.
54400 ^ were saying therefore some of those of jerusalem,
54406 ^ not this is he
54409 ^ whom they seek to kill?
54412 ^ and behold,
54414 ^ publicly he speaks,
54416 ^ and nothing to him they say
54420 ^ not ever. truly have recognized the rulers
54425 ^ that this is the christ?
54430 ^ but this [man], we know
54433 ^ from where he is.
54435 ^ the however
54437 ^ christ,
54438 ^ whenever he may come,
54440 ^ no one knows
54442 ^ from where he is.
54444 ^ cried out therefore in the temple
54449 ^ teaching - jesus,
54452 ^ and saying,
54454 ^ me you know,
54456 ^ and you know
54458 ^ from where i am;
54460 ^ and of myself not i have come,
54465 ^ but is true
54468 ^ the [one] having sent me,
54471 ^ whom you not know.
54475 ^ but i know him,
54478 ^ because from him i am,
54482 ^ and he me sent.
54485 ^ they were seeking therefore
54487 ^ him to take,
54489 ^ but no one laid upon him the hand,
54496 ^ because not yet had come the hour of him.
54502 ^ out of the crowd now
54506 ^ many believed in him
54510 ^ and were saying,
54512 ^ the christ,
54514 ^ when he comes,
54516 ^ not more signs will he do
54520 ^ than this [man] has done?
54523 ^ heard the pharisees the crowd
54528 ^ murmuring about him these things,
54532 ^ and sent the chief priests and the pharisees officers,
54540 ^ that they might seize him.
54543 ^ said therefore - jesus,
54547 ^ yet time a little with you i am,
54553 ^ and i go
54555 ^ to the [one] having sent me.
54559 ^ you will seek me
54561 ^ and not will find me;
54565 ^ and where am i,
54569 ^ you not are able
54572 ^ to come.
54573 ^ said therefore the jews among themselves,
54579 ^ where he is about to go
54583 ^ that we not will find him?
54588 ^ not
54589 ^ to the dispersion among the greeks is he about
54595 ^ to go
54596 ^ and to teach the greeks?
54600 ^ what is the word this
54605 ^ that he said,
54607 ^ you will seek me,
54609 ^ and not will find me,
54613 ^ and where am i
54617 ^ you not are able
54620 ^ to come
54621 ^ in now
54623 ^ the last day, the great [day] of the feast, stood - jesus
54633 ^ and cried out,
54635 ^ saying,
54636 ^ if anyone thirsts,
54639 ^ let him come to me
54642 ^ and drink.
54644 ^ the [one] believing in me,
54648 ^ as has said the scripture:
54652 ^ rivers out of the belly of him will flow
54658 ^ of water
54659 ^ living.
54660 ^ this now he said concerning the spirit,
54666 ^ whom were about to receive
54669 ^ those having believed in him;
54673 ^ not yet [given] for was [the] spirit,
54677 ^ because jesus not yet was glorified.
54681 ^ [some] of the crowd therefore,
54685 ^ having heard the words these, were saying
54690 ^ this is truly the prophet.
54695 ^ others were saying,
54697 ^ this is the christ.
54701 ^ others however were saying,
54704 ^ not indeed out of - galilee the christ comes?
54712 ^ not the scripture has said
54716 ^ that out of the seed of david and from bethlehem, the village
54726 ^ where was david, comes the christ?
54732 ^ a division therefore occurred in the crowd because of him.
54740 ^ some now desired
54743 ^ of them
54745 ^ to seize him,
54747 ^ but no one laid on him the hands.
54754 ^ came therefore the officers to the chief priests and pharisees,
54763 ^ and said to them that,
54767 ^ because of why not did you bring him?
54772 ^ answered the officers,
54775 ^ never spoke like this. a man
54779 ^ answered therefore them the pharisees,
54784 ^ not also you have been deceived?
54788 ^ not any of the rulers has believed on him,
54796 ^ or of the pharisees?
54800 ^ but the crowd this,
54804 ^ - not
54806 ^ knowing the law, accursed are.
54811 ^ says nicodemus to them,
54815 ^ the [one] having come to him, the former
54821 ^ one being
54823 ^ of them,
54825 ^ not the law of us does judge the man,
54832 ^ if not it has heard first from him
54838 ^ and known
54840 ^ what he does?
54842 ^ they answered
54843 ^ and said to him,
54846 ^ not also you from - galilee are?
54853 ^ search
54854 ^ and see
54856 ^ that out of - galilee a prophet not is raised.”
54863 ^ and went each to the home of him.
54870 ^ jesus however went to the mount - of olives.
54878 ^ early in the morning then again he came into the temple,
54885 ^ and all the people were coming to him.
54892 ^ and
54893 ^ having sat down, he was teaching them.
54896 ^ bring now the scribes and the pharisees a woman
54904 ^ in adultery having been caught,
54907 ^ and
54908 ^ having set her in [the] midst, they say to him,
54914 ^ teacher, this - woman was caught
54919 ^ in the very act, committing adultery.
54922 ^ in now
54924 ^ the law, us moses commanded
54929 ^ - such to be stoned.
54932 ^ you therefore, what say you?
54936 ^ this now they were saying,
54939 ^ testing him
54941 ^ so that they might have [grounds]
54943 ^ to accuse him.
54945 ^ - but
54947 ^ jesus,
54948 ^ down having stooped, with [his] finger began writing on the ground.
54956 ^ as however they continued
54959 ^ asking him,
54961 ^ having lifted himself up
54962 ^ also, he said to them,
54965 ^ the [one] sinless among you, [the] first at her let him cast. stone
54973 ^ and again
54975 ^ having stooped down, he continued to write on the ground.
54980 ^ - and having heard, they began to go away one by one
54987 ^ having begun from the elder ones,
54991 ^ and he was left alone,
54994 ^ and the woman
54997 ^ in [the] midst being.
55000 ^ having lifted up then, - jesus said to her,
55006 ^ woman, where are they?
55009 ^ no one you has condemned?
55012 ^ - and she said,
55015 ^ no one, sir.
55017 ^ said then - jesus,
55021 ^ neither i you do condemn;
55025 ^ go,
55026 ^ and from - now [on] no more sin.
55032 ^ again therefore to them spoke - jesus,
55038 ^ saying,
55039 ^ i am the light of the world;
55045 ^ the [one] following me no not shall walk in the darkness,
55054 ^ but will have the light - of life.
55060 ^ said therefore to him the pharisees,
55065 ^ you concerning yourself are bearing witness;
55069 ^ the testimony of you not is true.
55075 ^ answered jesus
55077 ^ and said to them,
55080 ^ even if i am bearing witness concerning myself,
55085 ^ true is the testimony of me,
55090 ^ because i know
55092 ^ from where i came
55094 ^ and where i am going.
55097 ^ you however not know
55101 ^ from where i come
55103 ^ or where i am going.
55106 ^ you according to the flesh judge;
55111 ^ i not am judging no one.
55115 ^ and if judge however i,
55120 ^ - judgment - my true is,
55126 ^ because alone not i am,
55130 ^ but i and the
55134 ^ having sent me father.
55137 ^ and in the law also
55142 ^ - of you it has been written
55145 ^ that of two men the testimony true is.
55152 ^ i am
55154 ^ the [one] bearing witness concerning myself,
55158 ^ and bears witness concerning me the
55163 ^ having sent me father.
55166 ^ they were saying therefore to him,
55169 ^ where is the father of you?
55174 ^ answered jesus,
55176 ^ neither me you know,
55179 ^ nor the father of me.
55183 ^ if me you had known,
55186 ^ also the father of me - you would have known.
55192 ^ these - words he spoke in the treasury,
55199 ^ teaching in the temple;
55203 ^ and no one seized him,
55207 ^ for not yet had come the hour of him.
55213 ^ he said then again to them,
55217 ^ i am going away
55219 ^ and you will seek me,
55222 ^ and in the sin of you, you will die;
55228 ^ where i go,
55231 ^ you not are able
55234 ^ to come.
55235 ^ were saying therefore the jews,
55239 ^ not will he kill himself,
55242 ^ that he says,
55244 ^ where i go,
55247 ^ you not are able
55250 ^ to come’?
55251 ^ and he was saying to them,
55254 ^ you from - below are;
55259 ^ i from - above am.
55264 ^ you of this the world are,
55270 ^ i not am of the world this.
55277 ^ i said therefore to you
55280 ^ that you will die in the sins of you;
55286 ^ if for not you believe
55290 ^ that i am [he],
55293 ^ you will die in the sins of you.
55298 ^ they were saying therefore to him,
55301 ^ you who are?
55304 ^ said to them - jesus,
55308 ^ from the beginning what also i am saying to you.
55314 ^ many things i have
55316 ^ concerning you to say,
55319 ^ and to judge;
55321 ^ but
55322 ^ the [one] having sent me true is;
55327 ^ and i
55328 ^ what i have heard from him,
55332 ^ these things i say to the world.
55337 ^ not they understood
55339 ^ that [about] the father to them he was speaking.
55344 ^ said therefore to them - jesus,
55349 ^ when you shall have lifted up the son - of man,
55355 ^ then you will know
55357 ^ that i am [he],
55360 ^ and from myself i do nothing,
55365 ^ but as taught me the father,
55371 ^ these things i speak.
55373 ^ and
55374 ^ the [one] having sent me, with me is;
55380 ^ not he has left me alone,
55384 ^ because i the things pleasing to him do always.
55391 ^ these things of his speaking,
55394 ^ many believed in him.
55398 ^ was saying therefore - jesus to the
55404 ^ having believed in him jews,
55407 ^ if you abide in the word - my,
55415 ^ truly disciples of me you are.
55419 ^ and you will know the truth,
55423 ^ and the truth will set free you.
55428 ^ they answered unto him,
55431 ^ seed of abraham we are,
55434 ^ and to no one have we been under bondage ever.
55438 ^ how you say
55441 ^ -, free you will become’?
55444 ^ answered them - jesus,
55448 ^ truly, truly, i say to you
55452 ^ that
55453 ^ everyone - practicing the sin, a slave is
55460 ^ of the sin.
55462 ^ - now
55464 ^ the slave not abides in the house to the age;
55473 ^ the son abides to the age.
55479 ^ if therefore the son you shall set free,
55485 ^ indeed free you will be.
55488 ^ i know
55489 ^ that seed of abraham you are;
55493 ^ but you seek
55495 ^ me to kill,
55497 ^ because the word - of me not receives a place in you.
55506 ^ that which i have seen with the father, i speak;
55513 ^ also you therefore
55516 ^ what you have heard from the father, you do.
55522 ^ they answered
55523 ^ and said to him,
55526 ^ the father of us abraham is.
55531 ^ says to them - jesus,
55535 ^ if children - of abraham you were,
55540 ^ the works - of abraham you would do;
55545 ^ now however you seek
55548 ^ me to kill,
55550 ^ a man
55551 ^ who the truth to you has spoken,
55556 ^ that i heard from - god.
55561 ^ this abraham not did.
55565 ^ you are doing the works of the father of you.
55572 ^ they said therefore to him,
55575 ^ we of sexual immorality not have been born;
55580 ^ one father we have,
55583 ^ - god.
55585 ^ said to them - jesus,
55589 ^ if - god father of you were,
55595 ^ you would have loved - me,
55598 ^ i for from - god came forth
55604 ^ and am here;
55606 ^ not even for of myself have i come,
55611 ^ but he me sent.
55615 ^ because of why the speech - my not do you understand?
55623 ^ because not you are able
55626 ^ to hear the word - my.
55631 ^ you of the father the devil are,
55638 ^ and
55639 ^ the desires of father of you, you desire to do.
55646 ^ he a murderer was from [the] beginning,
55651 ^ and in the truth not has stood,
55657 ^ because not there is truth in him.
55663 ^ whenever he might speak - falsehood,
55667 ^ from the own he speaks;
55671 ^ for a liar he is,
55674 ^ and the father of it.
55678 ^ i now
55680 ^ because the truth speak,
55684 ^ not you do believe me!
55687 ^ which of you convicts me concerning sin?
55694 ^ if [the] truth i speak,
55697 ^ because of why you not do believe me?
55703 ^ he who is of - god, the words - of god hears;
55713 ^ because of this you not hear,
55718 ^ because of - god, not you are.
55724 ^ answered the jews
55727 ^ and said to him,
55730 ^ not rightly say we
55734 ^ that a samaritan are you,
55738 ^ and a demon have?
55741 ^ answered jesus,
55743 ^ i a demon not have;
55747 ^ but i honor the father of me,
55752 ^ and you dishonor me.
55756 ^ i now not seek the glory of me;
55763 ^ there is
55764 ^ one seeking [it]
55766 ^ and judging.
55768 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
55772 ^ if anyone - my word keeps,
55778 ^ death never not shall he see, to the age.
55785 ^ said therefore to him the jews,
55790 ^ now we know
55792 ^ that a demon you have.
55795 ^ abraham died,
55797 ^ and the prophets,
55800 ^ and you say,
55803 ^ if anyone the word of me keeps,
55809 ^ never not shall he taste of death, to the age.
55816 ^ not you greater than are
55820 ^ the father of us abraham,
55824 ^ who died?
55826 ^ and the prophets died!
55830 ^ whom yourself make you?
55833 ^ answered jesus,
55835 ^ if i glorify myself,
55839 ^ the glory of me nothing is;
55844 ^ it is the father of me
55848 ^ - glorifying me,
55851 ^ [of] whom you say
55854 ^ -, god of us he is.
55858 ^ and not you have known him,
55862 ^ i however know him.
55866 ^ and if i say
55868 ^ that not i know him,
55872 ^ i will be like you, a liar.
55876 ^ but i know him,
55879 ^ and the word of him i keep.
55884 ^ abraham the father of you rejoiced
55889 ^ in that he should see - day - my,
55895 ^ and he saw
55897 ^ and rejoiced.
55899 ^ said therefore the jews to him,
55905 ^ fifty years [old] not yet are you,
55909 ^ and abraham you have seen?
55912 ^ said to them jesus,
55915 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
55919 ^ before abraham was,
55922 ^ i am.
55924 ^ they took up therefore stones,
55927 ^ that they might cast at him;
55931 ^ jesus however hid himself,
55934 ^ and went forth out of the temple.
55939 ^ and
55940 ^ passing by, he saw a man blind from birth.
55946 ^ and asked him the disciples of him
55952 ^ saying,
55953 ^ rabbi, who sinned,
55956 ^ this [man] or the parents of him,
55961 ^ that blind he should be born?
55964 ^ answered jesus,
55966 ^ neither this [man] sinned,
55969 ^ nor the parents of him;
55973 ^ but [it was] that should be displayed the works - of god in him.
55982 ^ us it behooves to work the works
55987 ^ of the [one] having sent me,
55990 ^ while day it is;
55993 ^ is coming night,
55995 ^ when no one is able
55998 ^ to work.
55999 ^ while in the world i shall be,
56004 ^ [the] light i am
56006 ^ of the world.
56008 ^ these things having said, he spat on [the] ground,
56012 ^ and made clay of the spittle,
56018 ^ and applied to him the clay
56023 ^ to the eyes.
56026 ^ and he said to him,
56029 ^ go,
56030 ^ wash in the pool - of siloam,
56036 ^ which means
56038 ^ sent.
56039 ^ he went therefore
56041 ^ and washed,
56043 ^ and came [back]
56045 ^ seeing.
56046 ^ the therefore
56048 ^ neighbors
56049 ^ and those having seen him - before,
56055 ^ that a beggar he was, were saying,
56059 ^ not this is
56062 ^ he who was sitting
56064 ^ and begging?
56066 ^ some were saying
56068 ^ -, he it is,
56071 ^ but others were saying,
56073 ^ no,
56074 ^ but like him he is. he
56079 ^ kept saying
56080 ^ -, i am [he].
56083 ^ they were saying therefore to him,
56086 ^ how then were opened of you the eyes?
56092 ^ answered
56093 ^ he, the man
56096 ^ - called jesus clay made,
56101 ^ and anointed of me the eyes,
56106 ^ and he said to me
56109 ^ -, go to - siloam
56114 ^ and wash.
56116 ^ having gone therefore
56118 ^ and having washed, i received sight.
56121 ^ and they said to him,
56124 ^ where is he?
56127 ^ he says,
56128 ^ not i know.
56130 ^ they bring him to the pharisees
56135 ^ who once [was] blind.
56138 ^ was now sabbath
56141 ^ in which day the clay had made - jesus
56149 ^ and opened of him the eyes.
56154 ^ again therefore were asking him also the pharisees
56161 ^ how he had received sight.
56163 ^ - and he said to them,
56167 ^ clay he put of me on the eyes,
56173 ^ and i washed,
56175 ^ and i see.
56177 ^ were saying therefore of the pharisees some,
56183 ^ not is this from god
56188 ^ the man,
56190 ^ for the sabbath not he does keep.
56195 ^ others however were saying,
56198 ^ how is able a man sinful
56202 ^ such signs to do?
56205 ^ and division there was among them.
56210 ^ they say therefore to the blind [man] again,
56215 ^ what you say concerning him,
56220 ^ for he opened of you the eyes?
56225 ^ - and he said
56228 ^ -, a prophet he is.
56231 ^ not did believe then the jews concerning him
56238 ^ that he had been blind
56241 ^ and had received sight,
56243 ^ until when they called the parents of him
56249 ^ - having received sight.
56251 ^ and they asked them
56254 ^ saying,
56255 ^ this is the son of you,
56260 ^ of whom you say
56263 ^ that blind he was born?
56266 ^ how then does he see presently?
56270 ^ answered therefore the parents of him
56275 ^ and said,
56277 ^ we know
56278 ^ that this is the son of us,
56284 ^ and that blind he was born.
56288 ^ how however presently he sees,
56292 ^ not we know,
56294 ^ or who opened of him the eyes,
56300 ^ we not know;
56303 ^ him ask;
56305 ^ age has he.
56308 ^ concerning himself, he will speak.
56311 ^ these things said the parents of him
56316 ^ because they were afraid of the jews;
56320 ^ already for had agreed together the jews
56325 ^ that if anyone him should confess christ,
56331 ^ expelled from the synagogue he would be.
56333 ^ because of this, the parents of him said
56339 ^ -, age he has;
56342 ^ him ask.
56344 ^ they called therefore the man out a second time
56350 ^ who had been blind,
56353 ^ and said to him,
56356 ^ give glory - to god!
56360 ^ we know
56362 ^ that this - man a sinner is.
56368 ^ answered then he,
56371 ^ whether a sinner he is,
56374 ^ not i know.
56376 ^ one [thing] i do know,
56378 ^ that
56379 ^ blind being, now i see.
56383 ^ they said therefore to him,
56386 ^ what did he to you?
56389 ^ how opened he of you the eyes?
56394 ^ he answered them,
56396 ^ i told you already,
56399 ^ and not you did listen.
56402 ^ why
56403 ^ again do you wish to hear?
56406 ^ not also you do wish
56410 ^ his disciples to become?
56413 ^ and they railed at him
56416 ^ and said,
56418 ^ you a disciple are
56421 ^ of that one;
56422 ^ we however - of moses are
56427 ^ disciples.
56428 ^ we know
56430 ^ that to moses has spoken - god;
56435 ^ this [man] however not we know
56439 ^ from where is.
56441 ^ answered the man
56444 ^ and said to them,
56447 ^ in this for - an amazing thing is,
56453 ^ that you not know
56457 ^ from where he is,
56459 ^ and yet he opened my - eyes.
56464 ^ we know
56465 ^ that sinners - god not does hear;
56471 ^ but if anyone god-fearing is,
56476 ^ and the will of him does,
56481 ^ him he hears.
56483 ^ out of the age never it has been heard,
56488 ^ that opened anyone [the] eyes of [one] blind
56493 ^ having been born.
56494 ^ if not were this [man] from god,
56500 ^ not he could
56502 ^ do nothing.
56504 ^ they answered
56505 ^ and said to him,
56508 ^ in sins you were born entirely,
56513 ^ and you teach us?
56517 ^ and they cast him out.
56521 ^ heard jesus
56523 ^ that they had cast him out,
56527 ^ and
56528 ^ having found him, he said,
56531 ^ you believe in the son of man?”
56538 ^ answered he
56540 ^ and said,
56542 ^ and who is he, lord,
56546 ^ that i may believe in him?
56550 ^ said to him - jesus,
56554 ^ both you have seen him,
56557 ^ and
56558 ^ the [one] speaking with you he is.
56564 ^ - and he was saying,
56567 ^ i believe, lord.
56569 ^ and he worshiped him.
56572 ^ and said - jesus,
56576 ^ for judgment i into the world this came,
56584 ^ that
56585 ^ those not
56587 ^ seeing may see;
56589 ^ and
56590 ^ those seeing, blind may become.”
56594 ^ heard of the pharisees these things,
56599 ^ who with him
56602 ^ were,
56603 ^ and they said to him,
56606 ^ not also we blind are?
56611 ^ said to them - jesus,
56615 ^ if blind you were,
56618 ^ not - you would have sin;
56622 ^ since however you say
56625 ^ -, we see,
56627 ^ the sin of you remains.
56631 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
56635 ^ the [one] not
56637 ^ entering in by the door to the fold of the sheep,
56646 ^ but climbing up another way,
56649 ^ he a thief is
56652 ^ and a robber.
56654 ^ the [one] however entering in by the door, shepherd is
56662 ^ of the sheep.
56664 ^ to him the doorkeeper opens,
56668 ^ and the sheep the voice of him hear,
56675 ^ and the own sheep he calls by name
56682 ^ and leads out them.
56685 ^ when the own all he has brought out,
56690 ^ before them he goes,
56693 ^ and the sheep him follow,
56698 ^ because they know the voice of him.
56703 ^ a stranger however in no way not they will follow,
56708 ^ but will flee from him,
56712 ^ because not they recognize - of strangers the voice.
56719 ^ this - allegory spoke to them - jesus;
56726 ^ they however not knew
56730 ^ what it was
56732 ^ that he was saying to them.
56735 ^ said therefore again - jesus,
56740 ^ truly, truly, i say to you
56744 ^ -, i am the door of the sheep.
56751 ^ all
56752 ^ who ever came before me, thieves are
56758 ^ and robbers;
56760 ^ but not did hear them the sheep.
56766 ^ i am the door;
56770 ^ by me if anyone enters in,
56775 ^ he will be saved,
56776 ^ and he will go in
56778 ^ and will go out,
56780 ^ and pasture will find.
56783 ^ the thief not comes
56787 ^ if not that he might steal,
56791 ^ and might kill,
56793 ^ and might destroy.
56795 ^ i came
56797 ^ that life they may have,
56800 ^ and abundantly may have [it].
56803 ^ i am the shepherd - good.
56809 ^ the shepherd - good, the life of him lays down for the sheep;
56820 ^ the hired servant
56822 ^ however not being [the] shepherd,
56826 ^ whose not are the sheep
56831 ^ own, sees the wolf
56835 ^ coming,
56836 ^ and leaves the sheep,
56840 ^ and flees —
56842 ^ and the wolf snatches them
56847 ^ and scatters —
56849 ^ because a hired servant he is,
56852 ^ and not is himself concerned to him about the sheep.
56859 ^ i am the shepherd - good;
56865 ^ and i know - my own,
56869 ^ and am known i by mine.
56874 ^ as knows me the father,
56879 ^ i also know the father;
56883 ^ and the life of me i lay down for the sheep.
56891 ^ and other sheep i have,
56895 ^ which not are of the fold this;
56902 ^ those also it behooves me to bring,
56906 ^ and the voice of me they will hear;
56911 ^ and there will be one flock, with one shepherd.
56917 ^ because of this, me the father loves,
56923 ^ because i lay down the life of me,
56929 ^ that again i might take it.
56933 ^ no one takes it from me,
56938 ^ but i lay down it of myself.
56944 ^ authority i have
56946 ^ to lay down it,
56948 ^ and authority i have
56951 ^ again to take it.
56954 ^ this - commandment i received from the father of me.
56962 ^ division again there was among the jews on account of the words these.
56972 ^ were saying now many of them,
56977 ^ a demon he has,
56979 ^ and is insane;
56981 ^ why him do you listen to?
56984 ^ others were saying,
56986 ^ these - sayings not are [those]
56991 ^ of one possessed by a demon.
56992 ^ not a demon is able
56995 ^ of [the] blind [the] eyes to open?
56998 ^ took place at the time the feast of dedication, at - jerusalem.
57005 ^ winter it was,
57007 ^ and was walking - jesus in the temple in the porch - of solomon.
57019 ^ encircled therefore him the jews,
57024 ^ and they were saying to him,
57027 ^ until when the soul of us hold you in suspense?
57033 ^ if you are the christ,
57038 ^ tell us plainly.
57041 ^ answered them - jesus,
57045 ^ i told you,
57047 ^ and not you believe.
57050 ^ the works
57052 ^ that i do in the name of the father of me,
57061 ^ these bear witness concerning me.
57065 ^ but you not believe,
57069 ^ because not you are from among the sheep - of me.
57077 ^ the sheep - of me, the voice of me hear,
57085 ^ and i know them,
57088 ^ and they follow me;
57091 ^ and i give them life eternal;
57096 ^ and never not shall they perish, to the age,
57103 ^ and never will seize anyone them out of the hand of me.
57112 ^ the father of me
57115 ^ who has given [them] to me, than all greater is,
57121 ^ and no one is able
57124 ^ to seize [them] out of the hand the father.
57130 ^ i and the father one are.
57136 ^ took up again stones the jews,
57141 ^ that they might stone him.
57144 ^ answered them - jesus,
57148 ^ many works good i have shown you from the father;
57156 ^ because of which of these work, me do you stone?
57162 ^ answered him the jews,
57166 ^ for a good work not we do stone you,
57172 ^ but for blasphemy,
57175 ^ and because you,
57178 ^ a man being, make yourself god.
57183 ^ answered them - jesus,
57187 ^ not is it
57189 ^ written in the law of you
57194 ^ -: i said
57197 ^ gods you are’
57199 ^ if them he called gods,
57203 ^ to whom the word - of god came,
57210 ^ and not is able
57213 ^ to be broken the scripture,
57216 ^ [of him] whom the father sanctified
57220 ^ and sent into the world, you do say
57227 ^ -, you blaspheme,
57229 ^ because i said,
57231 ^ son - of god i am’?
57235 ^ if not i do the works of the father of me,
57243 ^ not believe me.
57246 ^ if however i do,
57249 ^ even if me not you believe,
57253 ^ the works believe,
57256 ^ so that you may know
57258 ^ and may understand
57260 ^ that in me [is] the father,
57265 ^ and i in the father.
57269 ^ they were seeking therefore
57271 ^ him again to seize,
57274 ^ but he went forth out of the hand of them.
57280 ^ and he departed again beyond the jordan, to the place
57289 ^ where was john - at first
57294 ^ baptizing.
57295 ^ and he stayed there.
57298 ^ and many came to him
57303 ^ and were saying
57305 ^ -, john indeed sign did
57310 ^ no;
57311 ^ everything however
57313 ^ that said john about this [man], true was.
57320 ^ and many believed in him there.
57326 ^ was now a certain [man]
57329 ^ ailing,
57330 ^ lazarus of bethany, of the village of mary and martha, the sister of her.
57342 ^ was now mary
57345 ^ the [one] having anointed the lord with fragrant oil
57350 ^ and having wiped the feet of him with the hair of her,
57358 ^ whose - brother lazarus was sick.
57363 ^ sent therefore the sisters to him,
57369 ^ saying,
57370 ^ lord, behold,
57372 ^ [he] whom you love is sick.
57375 ^ having heard then, - jesus said,
57380 ^ this - sickness not is unto death,
57387 ^ but for the glory - of god,
57393 ^ that may be glorified the son - of god by it.
57401 ^ loved now - jesus - martha, and the sister of her, and - lazarus.
57414 ^ when therefore he heard
57417 ^ that he is sick,
57419 ^ then indeed he remained
57422 ^ in which he was
57425 ^ [the] place two days.
57428 ^ then after this he says to the disciples,
57434 ^ let us go into - judea again.
57439 ^ say to him the disciples,
57443 ^ rabbi, just now were seeking
57446 ^ you to stone the jews,
57450 ^ and again you are going there?
57454 ^ answered jesus,
57456 ^ not twelve hours are there in the day?
57462 ^ if anyone walks in the day,
57468 ^ not he stumbles,
57470 ^ because the light the world of this he sees;
57477 ^ if however anyone walks in the night,
57484 ^ he stumbles,
57485 ^ because the light not is in him.
57492 ^ these things he said,
57494 ^ and after this he says to them,
57499 ^ lazarus the friend of us has fallen asleep,
57504 ^ but i go
57506 ^ that i may awaken him.
57509 ^ said therefore the disciples of him,
57514 ^ lord, if he has fallen asleep,
57517 ^ he will get well.
57518 ^ had spoken however - jesus of the death of him;
57526 ^ they however thought
57529 ^ that of the rest - of sleep he speaks.
57536 ^ then therefore said to them - jesus plainly,
57543 ^ lazarus has died.
57545 ^ and i rejoice for sake of you,
57549 ^ in order that you might believe,
57551 ^ that not i was there.
57555 ^ but let us go to him.
57559 ^ said therefore thomas,
57562 ^ - called didymus, to the fellow disciples,
57567 ^ let go also us,
57570 ^ that we may die with him.
57574 ^ having come therefore, - jesus found him,
57580 ^ four already
57582 ^ days having been in the tomb.
57587 ^ was now - bethany near - jerusalem, about away stadia fifteen.
57598 ^ many now
57600 ^ of the jews had come unto - martha and mary
57609 ^ that they might console them concerning the brother.
57615 ^ - therefore
57617 ^ martha,
57618 ^ when she heard
57620 ^ that jesus is coming,
57623 ^ met him;
57625 ^ mary however in the house was sitting.
57631 ^ said then - martha to - jesus,
57638 ^ lord, if you had been here,
57642 ^ not - would have died the brother of me.
57648 ^ nevertheless even now i know
57652 ^ that
57653 ^ whatever - you might ask - god, will give you - god.
57662 ^ says to her - jesus,
57666 ^ will rise again the brother of you.
57670 ^ says to him - martha,
57674 ^ i know
57675 ^ that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day.
57684 ^ said to her - jesus,
57688 ^ i am the resurrection and the life;
57695 ^ the [one] believing in me,
57699 ^ even if he should die,
57701 ^ he will live;
57702 ^ and
57703 ^ everyone - living
57706 ^ and believing in me, never not shall die, to the age.
57716 ^ believe you this?
57718 ^ she says to him,
57720 ^ yes, lord;
57722 ^ i have believed
57724 ^ that you are the christ, the son - of god,
57733 ^ the [one] into the world
57737 ^ coming.
57738 ^ and
57739 ^ these things having said, she went away
57742 ^ and called mary, the sister of her,
57748 ^ secretly, having said,
57750 ^ the teacher is come,
57753 ^ and he calls you.
57756 ^ she then
57758 ^ when she heard,
57760 ^ rose up quickly
57762 ^ and was coming to him.
57766 ^ not yet now had come - jesus into the village,
57774 ^ but was still in the place
57780 ^ where had met him - martha.
57785 ^ the then
57787 ^ jews
57788 ^ - being with her in the house
57795 ^ and consoling her,
57798 ^ having seen - mary
57801 ^ that quickly she rose up
57804 ^ and went out, followed her,
57808 ^ having supposed
57809 ^ - she is going to the tomb
57814 ^ that she might weep there.
57817 ^ - therefore
57819 ^ mary,
57820 ^ when she came
57822 ^ to where was jesus,
57825 ^ having seen him, fell of him at the feet,
57832 ^ saying to him,
57834 ^ lord, if you had been here,
57838 ^ not - of me would have died
57842 ^ the brother.
57844 ^ jesus therefore
57846 ^ when he saw her
57849 ^ weeping, and the
57852 ^ having come with her jews
57855 ^ weeping,
57856 ^ he was deeply moved - in spirit
57859 ^ and troubled himself.
57862 ^ and he said,
57864 ^ where have you laid him.
57867 ^ they say to him,
57869 ^ lord, come
57871 ^ and see.
57873 ^ wept - jesus.
57876 ^ were saying therefore the jews,
57880 ^ behold
57881 ^ how he loved him!
57884 ^ some however
57886 ^ of them said,
57889 ^ not was able this [man]
57892 ^ - having opened the eyes of the blind,
57898 ^ to have caused
57899 ^ that also this one not should have died?
57904 ^ jesus therefore
57906 ^ again, being deeply moved in himself, comes to the tomb.
57914 ^ it was now a cave,
57917 ^ and a stone was lying against it.
57922 ^ says - jesus,
57925 ^ take away the stone.
57928 ^ says to him the sister
57932 ^ of the [one] having died, martha,
57935 ^ lord, already he stinks,
57938 ^ four days for it is.
57941 ^ says to her - jesus,
57945 ^ not said i to you
57948 ^ that if you should believe,
57951 ^ you will see the glory - of god?
57956 ^ they took away therefore the stone.
57960 ^ - now
57962 ^ jesus lifted his eyes upwards
57967 ^ and said,
57969 ^ father, i thank you
57972 ^ that you have heard me.
57975 ^ i and knew
57978 ^ that always me you hear;
57982 ^ but on account of the crowd
57986 ^ - standing around i said [it],
57989 ^ that they may believe
57991 ^ that you me sent.
57995 ^ and
57996 ^ these things having said, in a voice loud he cried out,
58001 ^ lazarus, come forth.
58004 ^ came forth
58005 ^ the [one] having been dead,
58007 ^ being bound the feet and the hands with linen strips,
58014 ^ and the face of him in a headcloth bound about.
58020 ^ says to them - jesus,
58024 ^ unbind him
58026 ^ and allow him
58029 ^ to go.
58030 ^ many therefore
58032 ^ of the jews
58035 ^ - having come to - mary
58040 ^ and having seen
58042 ^ what he did, believed in him;
58047 ^ some however
58049 ^ of them went to the pharisees
58055 ^ and told them
58058 ^ what had done jesus.
58061 ^ gathered therefore the chief priests and the pharisees a council,
58069 ^ and they were saying,
58071 ^ what are we to do?
58073 ^ for this - man many does
58079 ^ signs.
58080 ^ if we shall let him alone him like this,
58084 ^ all will believe in him,
58088 ^ and will come the romans
58092 ^ and will take away of us both the place and the nation.
58101 ^ one however
58103 ^ certain of them, caiaphas,
58107 ^ high priest being
58109 ^ the year same, said to them,
58114 ^ you not know nothing,
58118 ^ nor consider you
58120 ^ that it is profitable for you
58123 ^ that one man should die for the people,
58130 ^ and not all the nation should perish.
58136 ^ this now from himself not he said,
58142 ^ but
58143 ^ high priest being
58145 ^ the year that, he prophesied
58149 ^ that was about jesus
58152 ^ to die for the nation,
58156 ^ and not for the nation only,
58162 ^ but that also the children - of god,
58169 ^ those having been scattered, he might gather together into one.
58174 ^ from that therefore
58177 ^ - day they took counsel together
58180 ^ that they might kill him.
58183 ^ - therefore
58185 ^ jesus no longer publicly walked among the jews,
58192 ^ but went away from there into the region near the wilderness, to
58202 ^ ephraim called a city.
58205 ^ and there he stayed with the disciples.
58210 ^ was now near the passover of the jews,
58217 ^ and went up many to jerusalem out of the region before the passover,
58228 ^ so that they might purify themselves.
58231 ^ they were seeking therefore - jesus
58235 ^ and were saying among one another
58239 ^ in the temple standing,
58243 ^ what does it seem to you,
58246 ^ that no not he will come to the feast?
58253 ^ had given now the chief priests and the pharisees a command
58261 ^ that if anyone should know
58265 ^ where he is,
58267 ^ he should show [it],
58268 ^ so that they might seize him.
58271 ^ - therefore
58273 ^ jesus, before six days the passover, came to bethany,
58282 ^ where was lazarus,
58285 ^ whom had raised out from [the] dead jesus.
58290 ^ they made therefore him a supper there,
58295 ^ and - martha was serving,
58299 ^ - and
58301 ^ lazarus one was
58304 ^ of those reclining with him.
58309 ^ - therefore
58311 ^ mary,
58312 ^ having taken a litra of fragrant oil of nard pure of great price, anointed the feet - of jesus
58323 ^ and wiped with the hair of her the feet of him;
58331 ^ the now
58333 ^ house was filled with the fragrance of the oil.
58340 ^ says however judas - iscariot, one of the disciples of him,
58350 ^ - being about
58352 ^ him to betray,
58354 ^ because of why this - fragrant oil not was sold for three hundred denarii
58363 ^ and given to [the] poor?
58366 ^ he said however this,
58369 ^ not because for the poor he was caring to him,
58376 ^ but because a thief he was,
58380 ^ and
58381 ^ the money bag having,
58384 ^ that being put into [it] he used to pilfer.
58387 ^ said therefore - jesus,
58391 ^ leave alone her,
58393 ^ so that for the day of the burial of me she may keep it;
58402 ^ the poor for always you have with you;
58409 ^ me however not always you have.
58414 ^ knew therefore - a crowd great of the jews
58422 ^ that there he is;
58425 ^ and they came, not because of - jesus only,
58432 ^ but that also - lazarus they might see,
58438 ^ whom he had raised out from [the] dead.
58442 ^ took counsel however the chief priests
58446 ^ that also - lazarus they might kill,
58451 ^ because many on account of him were going away
58456 ^ of the jews
58458 ^ and were believing in - jesus.
58463 ^ on the next day the crowd great
58468 ^ - having come to the feast,
58473 ^ having heard
58474 ^ that is coming - jesus into jerusalem, took the branches of the palm trees
58485 ^ and went out to meet him,
58490 ^ and were shouting:
58492 ^ hosanna!”
58493 ^ blessed is
58494 ^ the [one] coming in [the] name of [the] lord!”
58499 ^ and the king - of israel!”
58504 ^ having found then - jesus a young donkey, he sat upon it,
58512 ^ as it is
58514 ^ written:
58515 ^ not fear, daughter of zion.
58519 ^ behold,
58520 ^ the king of you comes,
58524 ^ sitting on a colt of a donkey.”
58528 ^ these things not knew of him the disciples from the first,
58536 ^ but when was glorified jesus,
58540 ^ then they remembered
58542 ^ that these things were
58545 ^ of him written,
58548 ^ and these things they had done to him.
58552 ^ continued to bear witness therefore the crowd
58556 ^ - being with him
58560 ^ when - lazarus he called out of the tomb
58567 ^ and raised him out from [the] dead.
58572 ^ on account of this also met him the crowd,
58579 ^ because they heard
58581 ^ this of his having done
58584 ^ the sign.
58586 ^ - therefore
58588 ^ the pharisees said among themselves,
58592 ^ you see
58593 ^ that not you gain nothing.
58597 ^ behold,
58598 ^ the world after him has gone.
58603 ^ there were now greeks certain
58607 ^ among those coming up
58610 ^ that they might worship at the feast;
58615 ^ these therefore came to philip, who was from bethsaida - of galilee,
58624 ^ and they were asking him
58627 ^ saying,
58628 ^ sir, we desire
58630 ^ - jesus to see.
58633 ^ comes - philip
58636 ^ and tells - andrew;
58640 ^ come andrew and philip
58644 ^ and tell - jesus.
58648 ^ - and
58650 ^ jesus answered them
58653 ^ saying,
58654 ^ has come the hour
58657 ^ that should be glorified the son - of man.
58663 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
58667 ^ if not the grain - of wheat,
58673 ^ having fallen into the ground, should die,
58678 ^ it alone abides;
58681 ^ if however it should die,
58684 ^ much fruit it bears.
58687 ^ the [one] loving the life of him, loses it,
58694 ^ and
58695 ^ the [one] hating the life of him in the world this, to life eternal will keep it.
58709 ^ if me anyone serves,
58713 ^ me let him follow;
58715 ^ and where am i,
58719 ^ there also the servant - of me will be.
58726 ^ if anyone me serves,
58730 ^ will honor him the father.
58734 ^ now the soul of me has been troubled,
58739 ^ and what shall i say?
58742 ^ father, save me from the hour this.’
58749 ^ but on account of this i came to the hour this.
58757 ^ father, glorify of you the name.
58762 ^ came therefore a voice from - heaven:
58768 ^ both i have glorified [it],
58770 ^ and again i will glorify [it].
58773 ^ - therefore
58775 ^ the crowd
58776 ^ - having stood
58778 ^ and having heard was saying,
58781 ^ thunder there has been.
58783 ^ others were saying,
58785 ^ an angel to him has spoken.
58788 ^ answered jesus
58790 ^ and said
58792 ^ not because of me the voice this has come,
58799 ^ but because of you.
58802 ^ now [the] judgment is
58805 ^ the world of this;
58808 ^ now the prince of the world this will be cast out.
58816 ^ and i,
58817 ^ if i am lifted up from the earth,
58822 ^ all will draw to myself.
58826 ^ this now he was saying,
58829 ^ signifying
58830 ^ by what death he was about to die.
58834 ^ answered then him the crowd,
58839 ^ we have heard from the law
58844 ^ that the christ abides to the age,
58851 ^ and how say you
58855 ^ that it behooves
58857 ^ to be lifted up the son - of man?
58862 ^ who is this - son - of man?
58869 ^ said therefore to them - jesus,
58874 ^ yet a little while the light with you is.
58882 ^ walk
58883 ^ while the light you have,
58887 ^ so that not darkness you might overtake.
58892 ^ and
58893 ^ the [one] walking in the darkness not knows
58900 ^ where he is going.
58902 ^ while the light you have,
58906 ^ believe in the light,
58910 ^ so that sons of light you may become.
58914 ^ these things spoke jesus,
58917 ^ and
58918 ^ having gone away, he was hidden from them.
58922 ^ so many however of him
58925 ^ signs having been done before them,
58929 ^ not they believed in him,
58933 ^ so that the word of isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled
58940 ^ that said:
58942 ^ lord, who has believed the report of us?
58948 ^ and the arm of [the] lord to whom has been revealed?”
58954 ^ because of this, not they were able
58958 ^ to believe,
58959 ^ for again said isaiah:
58963 ^ he has blinded of them the eyes,
58967 ^ and has hardened of them the heart,
58972 ^ that not they should see with the eyes,
58977 ^ and understand with the heart,
58981 ^ and turn,
58983 ^ and i will heal them.”
58986 ^ these things said isaiah
58989 ^ because he saw the glory of him
58994 ^ and spoke concerning him.
58998 ^ nevertheless, indeed even of the rulers many believed in him;
59008 ^ but on account of the pharisees not they were confessing,
59014 ^ so that not put out of the synagogue they might be;
59018 ^ they loved for the glory - of men
59024 ^ more than the glory - of god.
59030 ^ jesus then cried out
59033 ^ and said,
59035 ^ the [one] believing in me, not believes in me,
59043 ^ but
59044 ^ in the [one] having sent me;
59048 ^ and
59049 ^ the [one] beholding me, beholds
59053 ^ the [one] having sent me.
59056 ^ i a light into the world have come,
59062 ^ so that
59063 ^ everyone - believing in me, in the darkness not should abide.
59073 ^ and if anyone of me hears
59078 ^ the words
59080 ^ and not keeps [them],
59083 ^ i not do judge him,
59087 ^ not for i came
59090 ^ that i might judge the world,
59094 ^ but that i might save the world.
59099 ^ the [one] rejecting me
59102 ^ and not receiving the words of me has
59109 ^ [one] judging him:
59112 ^ the word
59114 ^ which i spoke,
59116 ^ that will judge him in the last day.
59123 ^ for i from myself not spoke,
59129 ^ but the
59131 ^ having sent me father himself, me a commandment gave
59138 ^ what i should say
59140 ^ and what i should speak.
59143 ^ and i know
59145 ^ that the commandment of him life eternal is.
59152 ^ what therefore i speak,
59156 ^ as has said to me the father,
59161 ^ so i speak.
59163 ^ before now
59165 ^ the feast of the passover,
59169 ^ knowing - jesus
59172 ^ that had come his - hour,
59177 ^ that he would depart out of the world this to the father,
59186 ^ having loved the own who [were] in the world, to [the] end he loved them.
59197 ^ and supper taking place,
59200 ^ the devil already having put into the heart
59207 ^ that he should betray him of judas, [son] of simon iscariot,
59213 ^ knowing
59214 ^ that all things has given him the father into the hands,
59223 ^ and that from god he came forth
59228 ^ and to - god he is going, he rises from the supper
59237 ^ and lays aside the garments.
59241 ^ and
59242 ^ having taken a towel, he girded himself.
59246 ^ after that, he pours water into the basin,
59252 ^ and he began
59254 ^ to wash the feet of the disciples,
59259 ^ and to wipe [them] with the towel
59263 ^ with which he was
59265 ^ girded.
59266 ^ he comes then to simon peter,
59271 ^ who says to him,
59273 ^ lord, you of me do wash
59277 ^ the feet?
59279 ^ answered jesus
59281 ^ and said to him,
59284 ^ what i do you not know presently;
59291 ^ you will know however after these things.
59295 ^ says to him peter,
59298 ^ no not shall you wash of me the feet to the age.
59307 ^ answered jesus him,
59310 ^ if not i wash you,
59314 ^ not you have part with me.
59319 ^ says to him simon peter,
59323 ^ lord, not the feet of me only,
59329 ^ but also the hands and the head.
59336 ^ says to him - jesus,
59340 ^ the [one] having been bathed not has need,
59345 ^ if not
59347 ^ the feet to wash,
59350 ^ but is clean wholly;
59354 ^ and you all clean are,
59358 ^ but not all.
59361 ^ he knew for
59363 ^ the [one who] was betraying him;
59366 ^ on account of this he said
59369 ^ -, not all clean you are.
59374 ^ when therefore he had washed the feet of them
59380 ^ and taken the garments of him,
59385 ^ and having reclined again,
59388 ^ he said to them,
59390 ^ do you know
59391 ^ what i have done to you?
59394 ^ you call me
59397 ^ - teacher and - lord,
59402 ^ and rightly you say,
59405 ^ i am for.
59407 ^ if therefore i have washed your - feet,
59414 ^ the lord and the teacher,
59419 ^ also you ought
59422 ^ of one another to wash
59424 ^ the feet.
59426 ^ a pattern for i gave you,
59430 ^ that as i did to you,
59435 ^ also you should do.
59438 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
59442 ^ not is a servant greater than the master of him,
59449 ^ nor a messenger greater than
59452 ^ the [one] having sent him.
59455 ^ if these things you know,
59458 ^ blessed are you
59460 ^ if you do them.
59463 ^ not about all of you i speak.
59468 ^ i know
59470 ^ whom i chose,
59472 ^ but that the scripture may be fulfilled:
59477 ^ the [one] eating of me the bread lifted up against me the heel of him.’
59488 ^ from this time i am telling you
59492 ^ before - it comes to pass,
59495 ^ so that you should believe
59497 ^ when it comes to pass,
59499 ^ that i am [he].
59502 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
59506 ^ the [one] receiving
59508 ^ - any i shall send, me receives;
59513 ^ the [one] now me receiving, receives
59518 ^ the [one] having sent me.
59521 ^ these things having said, - jesus was troubled - in spirit,
59528 ^ and he testified
59530 ^ and said,
59532 ^ truly, truly, i say to you
59536 ^ that one of you will betray me.
59542 ^ began to look upon one another the disciples,
59547 ^ being uncertain
59548 ^ of whom he is speaking.
59551 ^ there was
59552 ^ reclining one of the disciples of him in the bosom - of jesus,
59563 ^ whom loved - jesus.
59567 ^ motions therefore to him simon peter
59572 ^ to ask
59573 ^ who it is
59576 ^ about whom he is speaking?
59579 ^ having leaned then he thus on the breast - of jesus, he says to him,
59590 ^ lord, who is it?
59593 ^ answers - jesus,
59596 ^ he it is
59598 ^ to whom i will dip the morsel
59603 ^ and will give him.
59606 ^ having dipped then the morsel, he takes [it]
59611 ^ and gives [it] to judas, [son] of simon iscariot.
59616 ^ and after the morsel, then entered into him - satan.
59626 ^ says therefore to him - jesus,
59631 ^ what you do, do quickly.
59635 ^ this now no one knew
59639 ^ of those reclining
59641 ^ to what he spoke to him.
59645 ^ some for were thinking,
59648 ^ since the money bag had judas,
59653 ^ that is saying to him - jesus,
59658 ^ buy
59659 ^ what things need [of] we have for the feast,
59665 ^ or to the poor that something he should give.
59671 ^ having received therefore the morsel, he went out immediately;
59678 ^ it was now night.
59681 ^ when therefore he had gone out,
59684 ^ says jesus,
59686 ^ now has been glorified the son - of man,
59692 ^ and - god has been glorified in him.
59698 ^ if - god is glorified in him,
59704 ^ also - god will glorify him in himself,
59711 ^ and immediately will glorify him.
59715 ^ little children, yet a little while with you i am.
59721 ^ you will seek me;
59723 ^ and, as i said to the jews
59728 ^ -: where i go,
59732 ^ you not are able
59735 ^ to come,
59736 ^ also to you i say now.
59740 ^ a commandment new i give to you,
59744 ^ that you should love one another;
59747 ^ as i have loved you,
59750 ^ so also you should love one another.
59755 ^ by this will know all
59759 ^ that to me disciples you are,
59763 ^ if love you have among one another.
59768 ^ says to him simon peter,
59772 ^ lord, where go you?
59775 ^ answered him jesus,
59778 ^ where i go,
59780 ^ not you are able
59782 ^ me now to follow;
59785 ^ you will follow however afterward.
59788 ^ says to him - peter,
59792 ^ lord, because of why not am i able
59797 ^ you to follow presently?
59800 ^ the life of me for you i will lay down.
59806 ^ answered jesus,
59808 ^ the life of you for me will you lay down?
59814 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
59818 ^ no not [the] rooster will crow,
59822 ^ until that you will deny me three times.
59827 ^ not let be troubled of you the heart.
59832 ^ you believe in - god,
59836 ^ also in me believe.
59840 ^ in the house of the father of me, mansions many there are;
59849 ^ if now not,
59852 ^ would i have told - you
59855 ^ that i go
59857 ^ to prepare a place for you?
59860 ^ and if i go
59863 ^ and prepare a place for you,
59867 ^ again i am coming
59869 ^ and will receive you to myself,
59874 ^ that where am i,
59878 ^ also you may be.
59881 ^ and to the place i am going,
59885 ^ you know the way.”
59888 ^ says to him thomas,
59891 ^ lord, not we know
59894 ^ where you are going;
59896 ^ how can we
59898 ^ the way know?
59901 ^ says to him - jesus,
59905 ^ i am the way, and the truth, and the life.
59915 ^ no one comes to the father,
59920 ^ if not by me.
59924 ^ if you had known me,
59927 ^ also the father of me you would have known;
59932 ^ from now you know him
59936 ^ and have seen him.
59939 ^ says to him philip,
59942 ^ lord, show us the father,
59947 ^ and it is enough for us.
59950 ^ says to him - jesus,
59954 ^ so long a time with you am i,
59959 ^ and not you have known me,
59963 ^ philip?
59964 ^ the [one] having seen me has seen the father;
59970 ^ how you say,
59973 ^ show us the father?’
59977 ^ not believe you
59979 ^ that i [am] in the father,
59984 ^ and the father in me is?
59990 ^ the words
59992 ^ that i speak to you, from myself not i speak,
60000 ^ - but
60002 ^ the father
60003 ^ in me dwelling does the works of him.
60010 ^ believe me
60012 ^ that i [am] in the father,
60017 ^ and the father in me;
60022 ^ if but not,
60025 ^ because of the works themselves believe.
60030 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
60034 ^ the [one] believing in me,
60038 ^ the works
60040 ^ that i do, also he will do,
60045 ^ and greater than these he will do,
60049 ^ because i to the father am going.
60055 ^ and whatever - you might ask in the name of me,
60063 ^ this will i do,
60065 ^ so that may be glorified the father in the son.
60072 ^ if anything you ask me in the name of me,
60080 ^ i will do [it].
60082 ^ if you love me,
60085 ^ - commandments - my you will keep.

60094 ^ and another helper he will give you,
60099 ^ that with you to the age, he may be the spirit - of truth,
60110 ^ whom the world not is able to receive,
60116 ^ because not it does see him,
60120 ^ nor know.
60122 ^ but you know him,
60125 ^ for with you he abides,
60129 ^ and in you he will be.
60133 ^ not i will leave you as orphans;
60137 ^ i am coming to you. yet a little while
60142 ^ and the world me no more sees,
60148 ^ you however see me;
60152 ^ because i live,
60155 ^ also you will live.
60158 ^ in that - day will know you
60164 ^ that i [am] in the father of me,
60170 ^ and you in me,
60174 ^ and i in you.
60177 ^ the [one] having the commandments of me
60182 ^ and keeping them,
60185 ^ he is
60187 ^ the [one] loving me;
60190 ^ the [one] now loving me, will be loved by the father of me;
60199 ^ and i will love him
60202 ^ and will show to him myself.
60206 ^ says to him judas, not - iscariot,
60212 ^ lord, then what has occurred
60216 ^ that
60217 ^ to us you are about to manifest yourself,
60221 ^ and not to the world?
60225 ^ answered jesus
60227 ^ and said to him,
60230 ^ if anyone loves me,
60234 ^ the word of me he will keep,
60238 ^ and the father of me will love him,
60244 ^ and to him we will come,
60248 ^ and a home with him will make.
60253 ^ the [one] not
60255 ^ loving me, the words of me not does keep;
60262 ^ and the word
60265 ^ that you hear, not is mine,
60270 ^ but of the
60272 ^ having sent me father.
60275 ^ these things i have said to you,
60278 ^ with you abiding.
60281 ^ the however
60283 ^ helper, the spirit - holy,
60288 ^ whom will send the father in the name of me,
60296 ^ he you will teach all things
60300 ^ and will bring to remembrance of you all things
60304 ^ that have said to you
60307 ^ i. peace i leave with you;
60311 ^ peace - my i give to you;
60316 ^ not as the world gives,
60321 ^ i give to you.
60324 ^ not let be troubled of you the heart,
60329 ^ nor let it fear.
60331 ^ you heard
60332 ^ that i said to you,
60336 ^ i am going away
60337 ^ and i am coming to you.
60341 ^ if you loved me,
60344 ^ you would have rejoiced -
60346 ^ that i am going to the father,
60351 ^ because the father greater than i is.
60357 ^ and now i have told you
60361 ^ before it comes to pass,
60363 ^ that when it shall have come to pass,
60366 ^ you might believe.
60367 ^ no longer much i will speak with you;
60372 ^ comes for the of this world ruler,
60378 ^ and in me not he has nothing;
60384 ^ but that may know the world
60389 ^ that i love the father,
60393 ^ and as has commanded me the father,
60399 ^ thus i do.
60401 ^ rise up,
60402 ^ let us go from here.
60404 ^ i am the vine - true,
60410 ^ and the father of me, the vinedresser is.
60417 ^ every branch in me
60421 ^ not bearing fruit,
60424 ^ he takes away it;
60426 ^ and
60427 ^ every one - fruit
60430 ^ bearing,
60431 ^ he prunes it,
60433 ^ that fruit more it may bear.
60437 ^ already you clean are by reason of the word
60444 ^ that i have spoken to you.
60447 ^ abide in me,
60450 ^ and i in you.
60453 ^ as the branch not is able
60458 ^ fruit to bear of itself,
60462 ^ if not it abide in the vine,
60468 ^ so neither [can] you,
60471 ^ if not in me you abide.
60476 ^ i am the vine;
60480 ^ you [are] the branches.
60483 ^ the [one] abiding in me,
60487 ^ and i in him,
60490 ^ he bears fruit much.
60494 ^ for apart from me not you are able
60499 ^ to do nothing.
60501 ^ if not anyone abide in me,
60507 ^ he is thrown out
60509 ^ like the branch
60512 ^ and is dried up,
60514 ^ and they gather them
60517 ^ and into the fire cast,
60522 ^ and it is burned.
60524 ^ if you abide in me
60528 ^ and the words of me in you abide,
60535 ^ whatever if you wish, you shall ask,
60539 ^ and it will come to pass to you.
60542 ^ in this is glorified the father of me,
60548 ^ that fruit much you should bear,
60552 ^ and you shall be to me disciples.
60556 ^ as has loved me the father,
60561 ^ i also you have loved.
60564 ^ abide in the love - of me.
60570 ^ if the commandments of me you keep,
60575 ^ you will abide in the love of me,
60580 ^ as i, the commandments the father of me have kept,
60588 ^ and i abide of him in the love.
60594 ^ these things i have spoken to you,
60597 ^ that - joy - my in you may be,
60605 ^ and the joy of you may be full.
60610 ^ this is - commandment - my,
60616 ^ that you love one another
60619 ^ as i loved you.
60622 ^ greater than this love no one has,
60627 ^ that one the life of him should lay down for the friends of him.
60637 ^ you friends of me are
60641 ^ if you do
60643 ^ what i command you.
60647 ^ no longer i call you servants,
60651 ^ for the servant not knows
60656 ^ what is doing his - master.
60661 ^ you however i have called friends,
60665 ^ because all things
60667 ^ that i heard from the father of me, i have made known to you.
60675 ^ not you me chose,
60679 ^ but i chose you,
60683 ^ and appointed you
60686 ^ that you should go
60689 ^ and fruit you should bear,
60692 ^ and the fruit of you should remain;
60697 ^ so that
60698 ^ whatever - you might ask the father in the name of me, he may give you.
60709 ^ these things i command you,
60712 ^ that you love one another.
60715 ^ if the world you hates,
60720 ^ you know
60721 ^ that me before you it has hated.
60726 ^ if of the world you were,
60731 ^ the world - [as] its own would love [you];
60737 ^ because however of the world not you are,
60744 ^ but i chose you out of the world,
60751 ^ on account of this hates you the world.
60757 ^ remember the word
60760 ^ that i said to you:
60764 ^ not is a servant greater than the master of him.
60771 ^ if me they persecuted,
60774 ^ also you they will persecute;
60777 ^ if the word of me they kept,
60782 ^ also - yours they will keep.
60786 ^ but these things all they will do against you on account of the name of me,
60796 ^ because not they have known
60799 ^ the [one] having sent me.
60802 ^ if not i had come
60805 ^ and spoken to them,
60808 ^ sin not they would have had;
60811 ^ now however excuse not they have for the sin of them.
60820 ^ the [one] me
60822 ^ hating, also the father of me hates.
60828 ^ if the works not i had done among them
60835 ^ that no other has done,
60839 ^ sin not they would have had;
60842 ^ now however both they have seen
60846 ^ and have hated both me and the father of me.
60854 ^ but [this is] that may be fulfilled the word
60859 ^ - in the law of them
60864 ^ having been written
60865 ^ -: they hated me without cause.’
60869 ^ when comes the helper,
60873 ^ whom i will send to you from the father, the spirit - of truth,
60884 ^ who from the father goes forth,
60889 ^ he will bear witness concerning me.
60893 ^ also you now bear witness,
60897 ^ because from [the] beginning with me you are.
60903 ^ these things i have spoken to you
60906 ^ that not you might fall away.
60909 ^ out of the synagogues they will put you;
60912 ^ but is coming an hour
60915 ^ that
60916 ^ everyone - having killed you will think
60921 ^ [it is] a service to offer - to god.
60925 ^ and these things they will do,
60928 ^ because not they know the father, nor me.
60935 ^ but these things i have said to you,
60939 ^ so that when might have come the hour of them,
60945 ^ you may remember them,
60947 ^ that i said [them] to you.
60951 ^ these things now to you from [the] beginning not i said,
60958 ^ because with you i was.
60962 ^ now however i go
60965 ^ to the [one] having sent me,
60969 ^ and none of you asks me,
60975 ^ where are you going?
60977 ^ but because these things i have said to you,
60982 ^ - sorrow has filled your - heart.
60988 ^ but i the truth say to you,
60994 ^ it is profitable for you
60996 ^ that i should go away.
60999 ^ if for not i go away,
61003 ^ the helper no will come to you;
61009 ^ if however i go,
61012 ^ i will send him to you.
61016 ^ and
61017 ^ having come, he will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment:
61030 ^ concerning sin indeed,
61033 ^ because not do they believe in me;
61038 ^ concerning righteousness now,
61041 ^ because to the father i go away,
61046 ^ and no more you behold me;
61050 ^ concerning now
61052 ^ judgment,
61053 ^ because the ruler of the world this has been judged.
61060 ^ yet
61061 ^ many things i have to you to say,
61065 ^ but not you are able
61068 ^ to bear them now.
61070 ^ when however shall come he, the spirit - of truth,
61078 ^ he will guide you into the truth all;
61084 ^ not for he will speak from himself,
61089 ^ but
61090 ^ whatever he may hear, he will speak;
61093 ^ and
61094 ^ the things coming he will declare to you.
61098 ^ he me will glorify,
61101 ^ for from that which [is] mine he will take,
61106 ^ and will disclose to you.
61109 ^ all things
61110 ^ whatever has the father, mine are;
61116 ^ because of this, i said
61119 ^ that from that which [is] mine he will take
61124 ^ and will disclose to you.
61127 ^ a little [while]
61128 ^ and no longer you do behold me;
61132 ^ and again a little [while]
61135 ^ and you will see me.”
61138 ^ said therefore [some] of the disciples of him to one another,
61146 ^ what is this
61149 ^ that he says to us,
61152 ^ a little [while]
61153 ^ and not you do behold me;
61157 ^ and, again a little [while]
61160 ^ and you will see me’
61163 ^ and because i am going to the father’?
61169 ^ they were saying therefore,
61171 ^ what is this
61174 ^ that he says,
61176 ^ a little [while]’?
61178 ^ not we do know
61180 ^ what he is saying.
61182 ^ knew - jesus
61185 ^ that they were desiring
61187 ^ him to ask,
61189 ^ and he said to them,
61192 ^ concerning this do you inquire among one another
61197 ^ that i said,
61199 ^ a little [while]
61200 ^ and not you do behold me,
61204 ^ and again a little [while]
61207 ^ and you will see me’?
61210 ^ truly, truly, i say to you
61214 ^ that will weep
61216 ^ and will lament you,
61219 ^ - but
61221 ^ the world will rejoice.
61223 ^ you will be grieved,
61225 ^ but the grief of you to joy will turn.
61232 ^ the woman
61234 ^ when she is giving birth,
61236 ^ pain has,
61238 ^ because has come the hour of her;
61243 ^ when however she brings forth the child,
61248 ^ no longer she remembers the tribulation, on account of the joy
61255 ^ that has been born a man into the world.
61261 ^ also you therefore, now indeed grief have;
61268 ^ again however i will see you,
61272 ^ and will rejoice your - heart,
61277 ^ and the joy of you no one will take from you.
61285 ^ and in that - day, of me not you will ask nothing.
61294 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
61298 ^ - whatever you may ask, the father in the name of me. he will give you,
61309 ^ until now not you have asked nothing in the name of me.
61318 ^ ask
61319 ^ and you will receive,
61321 ^ that the joy of you may be
61326 ^ full.
61327 ^ these things in allegories i have spoken to you;
61332 ^ is coming an hour
61334 ^ when no more in allegories i will speak to you,
61340 ^ but plainly concerning the father i will report to you. in that - day
61351 ^ in the name of me you will ask,
61356 ^ and not i say to you
61360 ^ that i will implore the father for you.
61367 ^ himself for
61369 ^ the father loves you,
61373 ^ because you me have loved
61377 ^ and have believed
61379 ^ that i from - god came forth.
61385 ^ i came forth from the father
61389 ^ and have come into the world;
61394 ^ again i leave the world
61398 ^ and go to the father.
61403 ^ say the disciples of him,
61407 ^ behold,
61408 ^ now in openness you speak,
61412 ^ and allegory not speak.
61416 ^ now we know
61418 ^ that you know all things,
61421 ^ and not need have
61425 ^ that anyone you should ask.
61429 ^ in this we believe
61432 ^ that from god you came forth.
61436 ^ answered them jesus,
61439 ^ now do you believe?
61441 ^ behold,
61442 ^ is coming an hour,
61444 ^ and has come,
61446 ^ when you will be scattered, each to the own,
61452 ^ and i alone you shall leave;
61455 ^ yet not i am alone,
61459 ^ for the father with me is.
61465 ^ these things i have spoken to you
61468 ^ so that in me peace you may have.
61473 ^ in the world tribulation you have.
61478 ^ but take courage;
61480 ^ i have overcome the world.
61484 ^ these things spoke jesus,
61487 ^ and
61488 ^ having lifted up the eyes of him to - heaven, he said,
61496 ^ father, has come the hour;
61500 ^ glorify your - son,
61504 ^ that the son may glorify you.
61509 ^ as you gave him authority over all flesh,
61515 ^ so that all
61517 ^ whom you have given him,
61520 ^ he may give to them life eternal.
61524 ^ this now is - eternal life,
61530 ^ that they may know you, the only true god, and
61538 ^ whom you have sent, jesus christ.
61542 ^ i you glorified on the earth,
61548 ^ the work having completed
61551 ^ that you have given me
61554 ^ that i should do.
61556 ^ and now glorify me you, father, with yourself, with the glory
61566 ^ that i had
61568 ^ before - the world
61572 ^ existed, with you.
61575 ^ i revealed your - name to the men
61581 ^ whom you have given me out of the world.
61587 ^ yours they were,
61589 ^ and to me them you gave,
61592 ^ and the word of you they have kept.
61597 ^ now they have known
61599 ^ that all things
61601 ^ whatever you have given me, of you are;
61607 ^ for the words
61610 ^ that you have given me, i have given them,
61615 ^ and they received [them]
61618 ^ and knew truly
61621 ^ that from you i came forth;
61625 ^ and they believed
61627 ^ that you me sent.
61631 ^ i concerning them am praying.
61635 ^ not concerning the world do i pray,
61640 ^ but
61641 ^ concerning those whom you have given me,
61645 ^ for yours they are.
61648 ^ and things of mine all, yours are;
61654 ^ and - yours, mine;
61658 ^ and i have been glorified in them.
61662 ^ and no longer i am in the world,
61668 ^ and yet themselves in the world they are,
61674 ^ and i to you am coming.
61678 ^ father holy, keep them in the name of you,
61686 ^ which you have given me,
61689 ^ that they may be one
61692 ^ as we [are].
61694 ^ when i was with them,
61698 ^ i was keeping them in the name of you,
61705 ^ which you have given me.
61708 ^ and i guarded [them],
61710 ^ and none of them has perished,
61715 ^ if not the son - of destruction,
61721 ^ that the scripture might be fulfilled.
61725 ^ now however to you i am coming;
61730 ^ and these things i speak in the world,
61736 ^ so that they may have - joy - my
61742 ^ fulfilled within them.
61745 ^ i have given them the word of you,
61751 ^ and the world hated them,
61756 ^ because not they are of the world,
61762 ^ even as i not am of the world.
61769 ^ not i do ask
61771 ^ that you should take them out of the world,
61777 ^ but that you should keep them from - evil.
61784 ^ of the world not they are,
61789 ^ as i not am of the world.
61796 ^ sanctify them by the truth;
61801 ^ the word - of you truth is.
61807 ^ as me you sent into the world,
61813 ^ i also sent them into the world;
61819 ^ and for them i sanctify myself,
61825 ^ that may be also they

61982 ^ these things having said, jesus went out with the disciples of him beyond the winter stream - of kidron,
61995 ^ where there was a garden,
61998 ^ into which entered he and the disciples of him.
62006 ^ knew now also judas,
62010 ^ who was delivering up him, the place,
62015 ^ because often gathered together jesus there with the disciples of him.
62024 ^ - therefore
62026 ^ judas,
62027 ^ having procured the cohort and from the chief priests and from the pharisees officers, comes there with lanterns, and torches, and weapons.
62047 ^ jesus therefore,
62049 ^ knowing
62050 ^ all things that are coming upon him, having gone forth
62056 ^ also said to them,
62059 ^ whom seek you?
62061 ^ they answered him,
62063 ^ jesus of nazareth.
62066 ^ he says to them,
62068 ^ i am [he].
62070 ^ had been standing now also judas,
62074 ^ who is delivering up him, with them.
62079 ^ when therefore he said to them,
62083 ^ i am [he],
62085 ^ they drew toward the back
62089 ^ and fell to [the] ground.
62092 ^ again therefore he questioned them,
62096 ^ whom seek you?
62098 ^ - and they said,
62101 ^ jesus of nazareth.
62104 ^ answered jesus,
62106 ^ i have told you
62108 ^ that i am [he].
62111 ^ if therefore me you seek,
62115 ^ allow these
62117 ^ to go away,
62118 ^ so that might be fulfilled the word
62122 ^ that he had spoken
62124 ^ -,
62125 ^ those whom you have given me, not i lost
62130 ^ of them not one.
62133 ^ simon then
62135 ^ peter,
62136 ^ having a sword, drew it
62140 ^ and struck the of the high priest servant,
62146 ^ and cut off of him the ear - right.
62153 ^ was now name of the servant malchus.
62159 ^ said therefore - jesus - to peter,
62165 ^ put the sword into the sheath.
62171 ^ the cup
62173 ^ which has given me the father,
62178 ^ no not shall i drink it?
62182 ^ - then
62184 ^ the cohort and the commander and the officers of the jews took hold of - jesus
62196 ^ and bound him,
62199 ^ and they led [him] away to annas first;
62204 ^ he was for father-in-law - of caiaphas,
62209 ^ who was high priest the year same.

62239 ^ since now
62241 ^ disciple that was known to the high priest,
62247 ^ also he entered with - jesus into the court of the high priest.
62256 ^ - but
62258 ^ peter stood at the door outside.
62264 ^ went out therefore the disciple - other, who was known to the high priest,
62274 ^ and spoke to the doorkeeper,
62278 ^ and brought in - peter.
62282 ^ says therefore - to peter the servant girl, the doorkeeper,
62290 ^ not also you of the disciples are
62297 ^ of the man this?
62300 ^ says he,
62302 ^ not i am.
62304 ^ were standing now the servants and the officers,
62311 ^ a fire of coals having made,
62313 ^ for cold it was
62316 ^ and they were warming themselves.
62318 ^ was now also - peter

62326 ^ and warming himself.
62328 ^ - then
62330 ^ the high priest questioned - jesus concerning the disciples of him and concerning the teaching of him.
62343 ^ answered him jesus,
62346 ^ i openly have spoken to the world;
62351 ^ i always taught in [the] synagogue and in the temple,
62360 ^ where all the jews come together,
62365 ^ and in secret i spoke nothing.
62370 ^ why me do you question?
62373 ^ question
62374 ^ those having heard
62376 ^ what i spoke to them;
62379 ^ behold,
62380 ^ they know
62382 ^ what said i.
62385 ^ these things now of him having said,
62389 ^ one
62390 ^ standing by of the officers gave a blow with the palm - to jesus,
62397 ^ having said,
62398 ^ thus answer you the high priest?
62402 ^ answered him jesus,
62405 ^ if evil i spoke,
62408 ^ bear witness concerning the evil;
62412 ^ if however rightly,
62415 ^ why me strike you?
62418 ^ sent then him - annas,
62423 ^ bound, to caiaphas the high priest.
62428 ^ was now simon peter
62432 ^ standing
62433 ^ and warming himself.
62435 ^ they said therefore to him,
62438 ^ not also you of the disciples of him are?
62446 ^ denied he
62448 ^ and said,
62450 ^ not i am.
62452 ^ says one of the servants of the high priest,
62459 ^ kinsman being [of him]
62461 ^ of whom had cut off peter
62464 ^ the ear,
62466 ^ not i you saw
62470 ^ in the garden with him?
62475 ^ again then denied peter,
62479 ^ and immediately a rooster crowed.
62483 ^ they are leading then - jesus from - caiaphas into the praetorium.
62493 ^ it was now early,
62496 ^ and they not entered into the praetorium
62503 ^ so that not they should be defiled,
62506 ^ but might eat the passover.
62510 ^ went therefore - pilate out to them
62517 ^ and said,
62519 ^ what accusation bring you against the man this?
62526 ^ they answered
62527 ^ and said to him,
62530 ^ if not were he
62534 ^ evil doing,
62536 ^ not - to you we would have delivered him.
62541 ^ said therefore to them - pilate,
62546 ^ take him yourselves
62549 ^ and according to the law of you judge him.
62556 ^ said to him the jews,
62560 ^ to us not it is permitted
62563 ^ to put to death no one
62565 ^ that the word - of jesus might be fulfilled,
62571 ^ which he had spoken,
62573 ^ signifying
62574 ^ what death he was about to die.
62578 ^ entered therefore again into the praetorium - pilate,
62586 ^ and he called - jesus
62590 ^ and said to him,
62593 ^ you are the king of the jews?
62599 ^ answered jesus,
62601 ^ of yourself you this say,
62606 ^ or others did say [it] to you concerning me?
62612 ^ answered - pilate,
62615 ^ not i a jew am?
62619 ^ the nation - of you and the chief priests delivered you to me.
62629 ^ what have you done?
62631 ^ answered jesus,
62633 ^ the kingdom - my not is of the world this;
62643 ^ if of the world this were - kingdom - my,
62653 ^ - attendants - my would fight -
62659 ^ that not i might be betrayed to the jews.
62664 ^ now however - kingdom - my not is from here.
62673 ^ said therefore to him - pilate,
62678 ^ then a king are you?
62682 ^ answered - jesus,
62685 ^ you say
62687 ^ that a king i am. i
62691 ^ for this have been born,
62694 ^ and for this i have come into the world,
62701 ^ that i may bear witness to the truth.
62705 ^ everyone - being of the truth hears of me the voice.
62715 ^ says to him - pilate,
62719 ^ what is truth?
62722 ^ and
62723 ^ this having said, again he went out to the jews
62730 ^ and says to them,
62733 ^ i no find in him
62738 ^ guilt.
62739 ^ it is however a custom with you
62743 ^ that one i should release to you at the passover;
62750 ^ wish you therefore
62752 ^ i should release to you the king of the jews?
62758 ^ they cried out then again
62761 ^ saying,
62762 ^ not this one,
62764 ^ but - barabbas!
62767 ^ was now - barabbas an insurrectionist.
62772 ^ at that time therefore took - pilate - jesus
62779 ^ and flogged [him].
62781 ^ and the soldiers,
62784 ^ having twisted together a crown of thorns, put [it] on of him the head,
62792 ^ and a robe purple cast around him,
62797 ^ and they began coming up to him
62801 ^ and saying,
62803 ^ hail, - king of the jews!
62808 ^ and they kept giving him blows with the palm.
62812 ^ and went forth again outside - pilate,
62818 ^ and he says to them,
62821 ^ behold,
62822 ^ i bring to you him out,
62826 ^ so that you may know
62828 ^ that no guilt i find in him.
62834 ^ went forth therefore - jesus outside,
62839 ^ wearing the thorny crown and the purple robe.
62847 ^ and he says to them,
62850 ^ behold
62851 ^ the man!
62853 ^ when therefore saw him the chief priests and the officers,
62862 ^ they cried out
62863 ^ saying,
62864 ^ crucify!
62865 ^ crucify!
62866 ^ says to them - pilate,
62870 ^ take him yourselves
62873 ^ and crucify [him];
62875 ^ i for no find in him guilt.
62882 ^ answered him the jews,
62886 ^ we a law have,
62889 ^ and according to the law, he ought
62894 ^ to die,
62895 ^ because [the] son of god himself he made.
62900 ^ when therefore heard - pilate this - word,
62908 ^ [the] more he was afraid.
62910 ^ and he went into the praetorium again,
62916 ^ and he says - to jesus,
62920 ^ from where are you?
62923 ^ - but
62925 ^ jesus an answer not did give him.
62930 ^ says therefore to him - pilate,
62935 ^ to me not speak you?
62938 ^ not know you
62940 ^ that authority i have
62943 ^ to release you,
62945 ^ and authority i have
62948 ^ to crucify you?
62950 ^ answered him jesus,
62953 ^ not you would have authority also me
62958 ^ against,
62959 ^ if not it were
62962 ^ given to you from above.
62965 ^ because of this,
62967 ^ the [one] having delivered up me to you, greater sin has.
62974 ^ out of this - pilate was seeking
62979 ^ to release him;
62981 ^ - but
62983 ^ the jews cried out,
62985 ^ saying,
62986 ^ if this [man] you release,
62989 ^ not you are a friend - of caesar.
62994 ^ everyone - a king himself
62998 ^ making, speaks against - caesar.
63002 ^ - therefore
63004 ^ pilate,
63005 ^ having heard the words these, brought out - jesus,
63013 ^ and sat down upon [the] judgment seat at a place
63019 ^ called [the] stone pavement;
63021 ^ in hebrew now, gabbatha.
63024 ^ it was now the day of preparation of the passover;
63029 ^ [the] hour was about the sixth.
63033 ^ and he says to the jews,
63037 ^ behold
63038 ^ the king of you!
63041 ^ they cried out therefore, with him
63044 ^ away,
63045 ^ away!
63046 ^ crucify him!
63048 ^ says to them - pilate,
63052 ^ the king of you shall i crucify?
63056 ^ answered the chief priests,
63059 ^ not we have a king,
63062 ^ if not caesar.
63065 ^ then therefore he delivered him to them,
63070 ^ that he might be crucified.
63072 ^ they took therefore - jesus.
63076 ^ and
63077 ^ bearing [his] own - cross, he went out
63082 ^ to the called of the skull place,
63087 ^ which is called in hebrew golgotha,
63091 ^ where him they crucified,
63094 ^ and with him others two, on this side and on that side,
63102 ^ in between now - jesus.
63106 ^ wrote then also a title - pilate
63112 ^ and put [it] on the cross.
63117 ^ it was now
63119 ^ written:
63120 ^ jesus of nazareth, the king of the jews.
63127 ^ this therefore
63129 ^ the title many read
63133 ^ of the jews,
63135 ^ for near was the place,
63140 ^ the city,
63142 ^ where was crucified - jesus,
63146 ^ and it was
63148 ^ written in hebrew, in latin, in greek.
63152 ^ were saying therefore - to pilate the chief priests of the jews,
63160 ^ not write,
63162 ^ the king of the jews,
63166 ^ but that he said,
63170 ^ king i am
63172 ^ of the jews.
63174 ^ answered - pilate,
63177 ^ what i have written, i have written.
63180 ^ the then
63182 ^ soldiers,
63183 ^ when they crucified - jesus,
63187 ^ took the garments of him
63191 ^ and made four parts,
63195 ^ to each soldier a part,
63198 ^ and also the tunic.
63201 ^ was now the tunic seamless, from the top woven
63210 ^ throughout all.
63212 ^ they said therefore to one another,
63216 ^ not let us tear up it,
63219 ^ but let us cast lots for it,
63223 ^ whose it will be,
63225 ^ that the scripture might be fulfilled
63229 ^ that said:
63231 ^ they divided the garments of me among them,
63236 ^ and for the clothing of me they cast a lot.”
63243 ^ the indeed therefore
63246 ^ soldiers these things did.
63249 ^ had been standing now by the cross - of jesus the mother of him, and the sister of the mother of him, mary the [wife] - of clopas, and mary - magdalene.
63273 ^ jesus therefore,
63275 ^ having seen [his] mother and the disciple
63281 ^ standing by
63282 ^ whom he loved,
63284 ^ says to [his] mother,
63287 ^ woman, behold,
63289 ^ the son of you.
63292 ^ then he says to the disciple,
63296 ^ behold
63297 ^ the mother of you.
63300 ^ and from that - hour took the disciple her to the own.
63312 ^ after this,
63314 ^ knowing - jesus
63317 ^ that now all things had been accomplished,
63321 ^ so that might be fulfilled the scripture, he says,
63326 ^ i thirst.
63327 ^ a vessel had been set [there]
63329 ^ of sour wine full;
63331 ^ a sponge therefore filled with sour wine, a stalk of hyssop having put on, they brought it to the mouth.
63342 ^ when therefore took the sour wine
63347 ^ - jesus, he said,
63350 ^ it has been finished.
63351 ^ and
63352 ^ having bowed the head, he yielded up the spirit.
63358 ^ - therefore
63360 ^ the jews,
63361 ^ because [the] preparation it was,
63364 ^ so that not would remain on the cross the bodies on the sabbath —
63375 ^ was for a high - day that - sabbath —
63383 ^ asked - pilate
63386 ^ that might be broken their - legs,
63391 ^ and they might be taken away.
63393 ^ came therefore the soldiers,
63397 ^ and of the indeed
63400 ^ first broke
63402 ^ the legs, and of the other
63407 ^ - having been crucified with him;
63410 ^ to however - jesus having come,
63415 ^ when they saw already him having been dead, not they did break his - legs.
63425 ^ but one of the soldiers with a spear his - side pierced,
63434 ^ and came out immediately blood and water.
63440 ^ and
63441 ^ the [one] having seen has borne witness,
63444 ^ and true of him is
63448 ^ the testimony.
63450 ^ and he knows
63453 ^ that truth he is speaking,
63456 ^ that also you might believe.
63460 ^ took place for these things
63463 ^ so that the scripture might be fulfilled:
63467 ^ bone not one will be broken
63470 ^ of him.”
63471 ^ and again, another scripture says:
63476 ^ they will look
63477 ^ on the [one] they have pierced.”
63480 ^ after then
63482 ^ these things, asked - pilate joseph - from arimathea,
63490 ^ being a disciple - of jesus —
63494 ^ concealed however through the fear of the jews —
63501 ^ that he might take away the body - of jesus;
63507 ^ and gave permission - pilate.
63511 ^ he came therefore
63513 ^ and took away the body of him.
63518 ^ came now also nicodemus,
63522 ^ the [one] having come to him by night at the first,
63529 ^ bearing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about litras a hundred.
63537 ^ they took therefore the body - of jesus
63543 ^ and bound it in linen cloths, with the spices,
63550 ^ as [the] custom is among the jews
63555 ^ to prepare for burial.
63556 ^ there was now in the place
63561 ^ where he was crucified a garden,
63564 ^ and in the garden a tomb new,
63570 ^ in which not yet no one was laid.
63576 ^ there therefore, on account of the preparation of the jews,
63583 ^ because near was the tomb, they laid - jesus.
63591 ^ - now
63593 ^ the first [day] of the week, mary - magdalene comes early,
63601 ^ dark still it being, to the tomb,
63607 ^ and she sees the stone
63611 ^ having been removed from the tomb.
63615 ^ she runs therefore
63617 ^ and comes to simon peter and to the other disciple,
63627 ^ whom loved - jesus,
63631 ^ and she says to them,
63634 ^ they have taken away the lord out of the tomb,
63640 ^ and not we know
63643 ^ where they have laid him.
63646 ^ went forth therefore - peter and the other disciple,
63654 ^ and were coming to the tomb.
63659 ^ were running now the two together,
63664 ^ and the other disciple ran ahead faster - than peter
63672 ^ and came first to the tomb.
63678 ^ and
63679 ^ having stooped down, he sees
63681 ^ lying [there] the linen cloths;
63684 ^ not however he entered.
63687 ^ comes then also simon peter
63692 ^ following him,
63694 ^ and he entered into the tomb
63699 ^ and sees the linen cloths
63703 ^ lying [there], and the soudarion,
63707 ^ which was upon the head of him,
63713 ^ not
63714 ^ with the linen cloths lying,
63718 ^ but
63719 ^ by itself having been folded up in a place.
63724 ^ then therefore entered also the other disciple,
63731 ^ - having come first to the tomb,
63737 ^ and he saw
63739 ^ and believed;
63741 ^ not yet for understood they the scripture
63746 ^ that it behooves
63748 ^ him out from [the] dead to rise.
63752 ^ went away therefore again to their [homes] the disciples.
63759 ^ mary however stood at the tomb outside
63766 ^ weeping.
63767 ^ as therefore she was weeping,
63770 ^ she stooped down into the tomb,
63774 ^ and she sees two angels in white
63780 ^ sitting, one at the head and one at the feet,
63790 ^ where had lain the body - of jesus.
63796 ^ and say to her they,
63800 ^ woman, why weep you?
63803 ^ she says to them,
63805 ^ because they have taken away the lord of me,
63810 ^ and not i know
63813 ^ where they have laid him.
63816 ^ these things having said, she turned back - around,
63822 ^ and she sees - jesus
63826 ^ standing [there],
63827 ^ and not had known
63830 ^ that jesus it is.
63833 ^ says to her jesus,
63836 ^ woman, why do you weep?
63839 ^ whom do you seek?
63841 ^ she,
63842 ^ thinking
63843 ^ that the gardener he is, says to him,
63849 ^ sir, if you have carried off him,
63854 ^ tell me
63856 ^ where you have laid him,
63859 ^ and i him will take away.
63862 ^ says to her jesus,
63865 ^ mary.
63866 ^ having turned around, she says to him in hebrew,
63871 ^ rabboni,
63872 ^ that is to say, teacher.
63875 ^ says to her jesus,
63878 ^ not me touch,
63881 ^ not yet for have i ascended to the father;
63887 ^ go however to the brothers of me
63893 ^ and say to them,
63896 ^ i am ascending to the father of me and father of you, and [to] god of me and god of you.
63910 ^ comes mary - magdalene
63914 ^ bringing word to the disciples
63917 ^ -, i have seen the lord,
63921 ^ and [that] these things he had said to her.
63925 ^ it being therefore evening the day same, the first of [the] week,
63934 ^ and the doors having been shut,
63938 ^ where were the disciples through the fear of the jews,
63947 ^ came - jesus
63950 ^ and stood in the midst,
63955 ^ and he says to them,
63958 ^ peace to you.
63960 ^ and
63961 ^ this having said, he showed his hands and his side to them.
63970 ^ rejoiced then the disciples,
63974 ^ having seen the lord.
63977 ^ said therefore to them - jesus again,
63983 ^ peace to you;
63985 ^ as has sent forth me the father,
63990 ^ i also send you.
63993 ^ and
63994 ^ this having said, he breathed on [them],
63997 ^ and he says to them,
64000 ^ receive [the] spirit holy.
64003 ^ if of any, you might forgive
64006 ^ the sins,
64008 ^ they are forgiven them;
64010 ^ if any you might retain,
64013 ^ they are retained.
64014 ^ thomas however,
64016 ^ one of the twelve,
64020 ^ the [one] called didymus, not was with them
64027 ^ when came jesus.
64030 ^ were saying therefore to him the other disciples,
64036 ^ we have seen the lord.
64039 ^ - but he said to them,
64043 ^ if not i see in the hands of him the mark of the nails,
64054 ^ and put the finger of me into the mark of the nails,
64064 ^ and put of me the hand into the side of him,
64073 ^ no not will i believe.
64076 ^ and after days eight again were inside the disciples of him,
64086 ^ and thomas with them.
64090 ^ comes - jesus,
64093 ^ the doors having been shut.
64096 ^ and he stood in the midst
64101 ^ and said,
64103 ^ peace to you.
64105 ^ then he says - to thomas,
64109 ^ bring the finger of you here,
64114 ^ and see the hands of me;
64119 ^ and bring the hand of you,
64124 ^ and put [it] into the side of me;
64130 ^ and not be unbelieving,
64134 ^ but believing.
64136 ^ answered thomas
64138 ^ and said to him,
64141 ^ the lord of me and the god of me!
64148 ^ says to him - jesus,
64152 ^ because you have seen me,
64155 ^ you have believed;
64156 ^ blessed [are]
64157 ^ those not
64159 ^ having seen,
64160 ^ yet having believed.
64162 ^ many indeed therefore also
64166 ^ other signs did - jesus in the presence of the disciples of him,
64175 ^ which not are
64178 ^ written in the book this;
64183 ^ these however have been written
64186 ^ that you may believe
64188 ^ that jesus is the christ, the son - of god,
64197 ^ and that
64199 ^ believing, life you may have in the name of him.
64206 ^ after these things, revealed himself again - jesus to the disciples at the sea - of tiberias.
64220 ^ he revealed [himself] now in this way:
64223 ^ they were together, simon peter, and thomas
64229 ^ - called didymus, and nathanael - from cana - of galilee, and the [sons] - of zebedee, and others of the disciples his two.
64250 ^ says to them simon peter,
64254 ^ i am going
64255 ^ to fish.
64256 ^ they say to him,
64258 ^ come also we with you.
64263 ^ they went forth
64264 ^ and went up into the boat,
64269 ^ and during that - night they caught nothing.
64276 ^ morning now already having come,
64280 ^ stood jesus on the shore;
64285 ^ not however knew the disciples
64290 ^ that jesus it is.
64293 ^ says therefore to them - jesus,
64298 ^ children, not any fish have you?
64303 ^ they answered him,
64305 ^ no.
64306 ^ - and he said to them,
64310 ^ cast to the right side of the boat the net,
64319 ^ and you will find [some].
64321 ^ they cast therefore,
64323 ^ and not
64325 ^ it to haul in were they able, from the multitude of the fish.
64333 ^ says therefore the disciple that
64338 ^ whom loved - jesus - to peter,
64344 ^ the lord it is.
64347 ^ simon therefore
64349 ^ peter,
64350 ^ having heard
64351 ^ that the lord it is, the outer garment put on
64358 ^ he was for naked
64361 ^ and he cast himself into the sea.
64367 ^ - and
64369 ^ the other disciples in the boat came,
64374 ^ not for were they far from the land,
64381 ^ but about away cubits two hundred,
64386 ^ dragging the net with the fish.
64391 ^ when therefore they got out onto the land,
64397 ^ they see a fire of coals
64399 ^ lying, and fish
64402 ^ lying on [it], and bread.
64405 ^ says to them - jesus,
64409 ^ bring [some] of the fish
64413 ^ that you have caught now.
64416 ^ went up therefore simon peter
64420 ^ and drew the net to the land,
64427 ^ full of fish large, a hundred fifty three;
64433 ^ although so many there are,
64436 ^ not was torn the net.
64440 ^ says to them - jesus,
64444 ^ come,
64445 ^ have breakfast.
64446 ^ none however dared
64449 ^ of the disciples
64451 ^ to ask him,
64453 ^ you who are?
64456 ^ knowing
64457 ^ that the lord it is.
64461 ^ comes jesus
64463 ^ and takes the bread
64467 ^ and gives [it] to them,
64470 ^ and the fish likewise.
64474 ^ this [is] now
64476 ^ the third time was revealed jesus to the disciples,
64481 ^ having been raised out from [the] dead.
64484 ^ when therefore they had dined,
64487 ^ says - to simon peter - jesus,
64493 ^ simon [son] of john, love you me more than these?
64499 ^ he says to him,
64501 ^ yes, lord;
64503 ^ you know
64505 ^ that i dearly love you.
64508 ^ he says to him,
64510 ^ feed the lambs of me.
64514 ^ he says to him again a second time,
64518 ^ simon [son] of john, love you me?
64522 ^ he says to him,
64524 ^ yes, lord;
64526 ^ you know
64528 ^ that i dearly love you.
64531 ^ he says to him,
64533 ^ shepherd the sheep of me.
64537 ^ he says to him the third time,
64541 ^ simon [son] of john, do you dearly love me?
64545 ^ was grieved - peter
64548 ^ because he said to him the third time,
64553 ^ do you dearly love me?
64555 ^ and he said to him,
64558 ^ lord, all things you know;
64562 ^ you know
64564 ^ that i dearly love you.
64567 ^ says to him - jesus,
64571 ^ feed the sheep of me.
64575 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
64579 ^ when you were younger,
64582 ^ you dressed yourself
64584 ^ and walked
64586 ^ where you desired;
64588 ^ when however you shall be old,
64591 ^ you will stretch forth the hands of you,
64595 ^ and another you will dress
64599 ^ and will bring [you]
64601 ^ where not you do desire.
64604 ^ this now he said
64607 ^ signifying
64608 ^ by what death he will glorify - god.
64613 ^ and
64614 ^ this having said, he says to him,
64618 ^ follow me.
64620 ^ having turned, - peter sees the disciple
64626 ^ whom loved - jesus
64630 ^ following,
64631 ^ who also had reclined at the supper on the bosom of him,
64641 ^ and said,
64643 ^ lord, who is it
64646 ^ who is betraying you?
64649 ^ him therefore having seen, - peter says - to jesus,
64657 ^ lord, this man and what about?
64661 ^ says to him - jesus,
64665 ^ if
64666 ^ him i desire
64668 ^ to remain
64669 ^ until i come,
64671 ^ what [is it] to you?
64674 ^ you me follow!
64677 ^ went out therefore this - saying among the brothers,
64685 ^ that the disciple that, not dies.
64691 ^ not said however to him - jesus
64697 ^ that not he dies,
64700 ^ but, if
64702 ^ him i desire
64704 ^ to remain
64705 ^ until i come,
64707 ^ what [is it] to you?
64710 ^ this is the disciple
64714 ^ - bearing witness concerning these things,
64718 ^ and the [one] having written these things,
64722 ^ and we know
64724 ^ that true of him the testimony is.
64730 ^ there are now also other things many
64735 ^ that did - jesus,
64739 ^ which if they should be written every one,
64744 ^ not even
64745 ^ itself i suppose the world to have space for the
64751 ^ to be written books.
64753 ^ the indeed
64755 ^ first account i composed concerning all the things, o theophilus,
64762 ^ which began - jesus
64766 ^ to do both
64768 ^ and to teach,
64770 ^ until the day,
64773 ^ having given orders to the apostles by [the] spirit holy
64779 ^ whom he had chosen, he was taken up,
64782 ^ to whom also he presented himself
64786 ^ alive
64787 ^ after the suffering of him with many proofs,
64794 ^ during days forty being seen by them
64799 ^ and speaking the things concerning the kingdom - of god.
64807 ^ and
64808 ^ being assembled together, he instructed them
64811 ^ from jerusalem not to depart,
64815 ^ but to await the promise of the father:
64821 ^ that which you heard of me;
64824 ^ for john indeed baptized with water;
64829 ^ you however with [the] spirit will be baptized
64834 ^ holy, not after many these days.
64840 ^ those indeed therefore
64843 ^ having come together, were asking him,
64846 ^ saying,
64847 ^ lord, if at the time this, are you restoring the kingdom - to israel?
64858 ^ he said then to them,
64862 ^ not yours it is
64865 ^ to know times or seasons
64869 ^ which the father put in place by - his own authority.
64877 ^ but you will receive power,
64880 ^ having come the holy spirit upon you,
64886 ^ and you will be for me witnesses, in both jerusalem, and in all - judea, and samaria, and to [the] uttermost part of the earth.
64905 ^ and
64906 ^ these things having said,
64908 ^ beholding they, he was taken up,
64911 ^ and a cloud hid him from the eyes of them.
64919 ^ and as
64921 ^ looking intently they were into the heaven
64926 ^ as was going he,
64928 ^ then behold
64930 ^ men two stood by them
64934 ^ in apparel white,
64937 ^ who also said,
64940 ^ men, galileans, why do you stand
64944 ^ looking into - heaven?
64948 ^ this - jesus,
64951 ^ - having been taken up from you into - heaven, thus will come
64960 ^ in that manner you beheld him
64964 ^ going into - heaven.
64968 ^ then they returned to jerusalem from [the] mount
64974 ^ - called olivet,
64977 ^ which is near jerusalem,
64981 ^ a sabbath day’s holding
64983 ^ journey.
64984 ^ and when they had entered into the upper room,
64990 ^ they went up
64991 ^ where they were staying, - both peter and john, and james and andrew, philip and thomas, bartholomew and matthew, james [son] of alphaeus, and simon the zealot, and judas [son] of james.
65018 ^ these all were
65021 ^ steadfastly continuing with one accord - in prayer, with [the] women, and mary the mother - of jesus, and the brothers of him.
65037 ^ and in the days these,
65042 ^ having stood up peter in [the] midst of the brothers, he said —
65049 ^ was then [the] number of names together the same about a hundred twenty —
65059 ^ men, brothers, it was necessary for
65062 ^ to have been fulfilled the scripture
65065 ^ which spoke beforehand the spirit - holy by [the] mouth of david concerning judas,
65076 ^ the [one] having become guide
65079 ^ to those having arrested jesus;
65082 ^ for
65083 ^ numbered he was with us,
65087 ^ and was allotted - a share of the ministry this.
65094 ^ this [man] indeed then acquired a field out of [the] reward - of unrighteousness,
65103 ^ and
65104 ^ headlong having fallen, he burst open in [the] middle,
65108 ^ and gushed out all the intestines of him.
65114 ^ and known it became
65117 ^ to all those dwelling in jerusalem,
65121 ^ so that was called the field that in the own language of them akeldama,
65131 ^ that is, field of blood.
65135 ^ it has been written for in [the] book of psalms:
65140 ^ let become the homestead of him desolate,
65145 ^ and not let there be
65148 ^ [one person] dwelling in it,’
65152 ^ and, the position of him let take another.’
65158 ^ it behooves therefore
65160 ^ the having accompanied us men, during all [the] time
65167 ^ that came in and went out among us the lord jesus,
65176 ^ having begun from the baptism of john until the day
65184 ^ in which he was taken up from us,
65188 ^ a witness of the resurrection of him with us to become one of these.
65197 ^ and they put forward two, joseph
65201 ^ - called barsabbas,
65204 ^ who was called justus, and matthias.
65209 ^ and
65210 ^ having prayed, they said,
65212 ^ you lord, knower of the hearts of all, show which you have chosen of these - two, one
65224 ^ to take the place of the ministry this and apostleship,
65232 ^ from which turned aside judas
65236 ^ to go to the place - own.
65242 ^ and they gave lots for them,
65246 ^ and fell the lot on matthias,
65252 ^ and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
65258 ^ and
65259 ^ during the arriving of the day - of pentecost, they were all together in the one [place].
65272 ^ and came suddenly out of - heaven a sound,
65279 ^ like [the] rushing of a wind violent,
65283 ^ and it filled all the house
65288 ^ where they were sitting.
65291 ^ and there appeared to them
65294 ^ dividing tongues as of fire
65298 ^ and sat upon one each of them.
65304 ^ and they were filled with all spirit holy,
65309 ^ and began
65311 ^ to speak in other tongues
65314 ^ as the spirit was giving
65318 ^ to utter forth to them.
65320 ^ were now
65322 ^ in jerusalem dwelling jews, men devout from every nation of those under - heaven.
65335 ^ having come about now the sound of this,
65340 ^ came together the multitude
65343 ^ and was confounded,
65345 ^ because was hearing one each
65349 ^ the own language speaking them.
65354 ^ they were amazed then
65356 ^ and were marveling,
65358 ^ saying,
65359 ^ not
65360 ^ behold
65361 ^ all these are who are speaking galileans?
65367 ^ and how we hear
65371 ^ each the own language of us,
65376 ^ in which we were born?
65379 ^ parthians, and medes, and elamites;
65384 ^ and those inhabiting - mesopotamia, judea also, and cappadocia, pontus and - asia; phrygia both and pamphylia, egypt and the parts - of libya that [are] around cyrene, and those
65412 ^ visiting [here] from rome; jews both and converts, cretans and arabs —
65421 ^ we hear speaking them - [in] our own tongues the great things - of god!
65431 ^ were amazed then all
65434 ^ and were perplexed,
65436 ^ other to other
65439 ^ saying,
65440 ^ what wishes this to be?
65444 ^ others however
65446 ^ mocking were saying
65448 ^ -,
65449 ^ of new wine full they are.
65452 ^ having stood up however - peter with the eleven, he lifted up the voice of him
65463 ^ and spoke forth to them:
65466 ^ men of judea
65468 ^ and those inhabiting jerusalem
65472 ^ all, this to you known let be,
65477 ^ and give heed to the words of me.
65482 ^ not for
65484 ^ as you suppose, these are drunkards;
65489 ^ it is for [the] hour third of the day;
65495 ^ but this is
65498 ^ that having been spoken by the prophet joel:
65504 ^ and it will be in the last days,
65510 ^ says - god,
65513 ^ i will pour out of the spirit of me upon all flesh;
65521 ^ and will prophesy the sons of you, and the daughters of you;
65530 ^ and the young men of you visions will see,
65536 ^ and the elders of you dreams will dream;
65542 ^ and even upon the servants of me, and upon the handmaidens of me, in the days those i will pour out of the spirit of me,
65562 ^ and they will prophesy.
65564 ^ and i will show wonders in - heaven above,
65571 ^ and signs on the earth below,
65577 ^ blood and fire and vapor of smoke.
65583 ^ the sun will be turned into darkness,
65588 ^ and the moon into blood,
65593 ^ before coming day of [the] lord, - great and glorious.
65601 ^ and it shall be,
65603 ^ everyone
65604 ^ who if they shall call upon the name of [the] lord will be saved.’
65611 ^ men, israelites, hear the words these:
65617 ^ jesus of nazareth, a man
65621 ^ having been set forth by - god to you by miracles and wonders and signs,
65632 ^ which did by him - god in the midst of you,
65641 ^ as you yourselves know,
65644 ^ him by the
65646 ^ determinate plan and foreknowledge - of god, delivered up by hands lawless,
65656 ^ having crucified, you put to death,
65658 ^ whom - god raised up,
65662 ^ having loosed the agony of death,
65667 ^ inasmuch as not it was possible
65671 ^ [for] to be held him by it.
65675 ^ david for says about him:
65680 ^ i foresaw the lord before me continually everything,
65687 ^ because at [the] right hand of me he is,
65692 ^ that not i should be shaken.
65695 ^ because of this was glad the heart, of me
65701 ^ and rejoiced the tongue of me;
65706 ^ and now also the flesh of me will dwell in hope,
65715 ^ for not you will abandon the soul of me into hades,
65723 ^ nor will you allow the holy one of you
65728 ^ to see decay.
65730 ^ you have made known to me [the] paths of life;
65734 ^ you will fill me with joy in the presence of you.’
65741 ^ men, brothers,
65743 ^ it is permitted [me]
65744 ^ to speak with freedom to you concerning the patriarch david,
65753 ^ that both he died
65756 ^ and was buried,
65758 ^ and the tomb of him is among us unto the day this.
65769 ^ a prophet therefore
65771 ^ being,
65772 ^ and knowing
65774 ^ that with an oath swore to him - god
65780 ^ out of [the] fruit of the loins of him to set upon the throne of him.
65790 ^ having foreseen, he spoke concerning the resurrection of the christ,
65797 ^ that neither was he abandoned into hades,
65802 ^ nor the flesh of him saw decay.
65808 ^ this - jesus has raised up - god,
65814 ^ whereof all we are
65818 ^ witnesses.
65819 ^ to the right hand therefore
65822 ^ - of god having been exalted,
65825 ^ - and
65827 ^ the promise of the spirit - holy having received from the father, he has poured out this
65838 ^ which you both are seeing
65842 ^ and hearing.
65844 ^ not for david ascended into the heavens;
65851 ^ he says however himself:
65854 ^ said the lord to [the] lord of me,
65860 ^ sit at [the] right hand of me,
65864 ^ until - i place the enemies of you, a footstool of the feet of you.’
65874 ^ assuredly therefore let know all [the] house of israel
65880 ^ that both lord him
65884 ^ and christ has made - god —
65889 ^ this - jesus
65892 ^ whom you crucified.
65895 ^ having heard then, they were pierced to the heart;
65900 ^ they said then to - peter and the other apostles,
65909 ^ what shall we do, men, brothers?
65913 ^ peter then to them,
65917 ^ repent, he declared,
65919 ^ and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of the sins of you,
65933 ^ and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit.
65940 ^ to you for is the promise,
65945 ^ and to the children of you, and to all those at a distance,
65954 ^ as many as - shall call to himself [the] lord, the god of us.
65961 ^ other and
65963 ^ words many he earnestly testified,
65966 ^ and was exhorting them,
65969 ^ saying,
65970 ^ be saved from the generation - perverse this.
65977 ^ those indeed therefore
65980 ^ having received the word of him were baptized;
65985 ^ and were added on the day that, souls about three thousand.
65994 ^ they were now
65996 ^ steadfastly continuing in the teaching of the apostles, and - in fellowship, the breaking of the bread, and the prayers.
66011 ^ there was coming then upon every soul awe,
66016 ^ many and both
66018 ^ wonders and signs through the apostles were taking place.
66025 ^ all now - having believed were together the same
66033 ^ and having all things in common;
66037 ^ and the possessions and the goods they were selling
66044 ^ and were dividing them to all,
66048 ^ as - anyone need had.
66053 ^ every day and
66056 ^ steadfastly continuing with one accord in the temple,
66061 ^ breaking then at each house bread, they were partaking of food with gladness and sincerity of heart,
66073 ^ praising - god
66076 ^ and having favor with all the people.
66083 ^ - and
66085 ^ the lord kept adding
66087 ^ those who were being saved every day to their number.
66094 ^ peter now
66096 ^ and john were going up into the temple at the hour - of prayer, the ninth.
66109 ^ and a certain man,
66112 ^ lame from womb of mother of him being, was being carried,
66119 ^ whom they placed every day at the gate of the temple
66128 ^ - called beautiful
66131 ^ - to ask for alms
66134 ^ from those who were going into the temple,
66140 ^ who
66141 ^ having seen peter and john
66145 ^ being about
66146 ^ to enter into the temple, was asking
66151 ^ alms to receive.
66153 ^ having looked intently now peter upon him, with - john, he said,
66162 ^ look unto us.
66165 ^ - and he began to give heed to them,
66169 ^ expecting
66170 ^ something from them to receive.
66174 ^ said however peter,
66177 ^ silver and gold none there is to me;
66183 ^ what however i have,
66186 ^ this to you i give:
66189 ^ in the name of jesus christ of nazareth, rise up
66197 ^ and walk!”
66199 ^ and
66200 ^ having taken him by the right hand, he raised up him;
66207 ^ immediately then were strengthened the feet of him, and the ankles.
66216 ^ and
66217 ^ leaping up, he stood
66219 ^ and began walking,
66221 ^ and he entered with them into the temple,
66228 ^ walking
66229 ^ and leaping
66231 ^ and praising - god.
66235 ^ and saw all the people him
66241 ^ walking
66242 ^ and praising - god.
66246 ^ they recognized then him,
66249 ^ that he was
66252 ^ the [one] for the alms
66256 ^ sitting at the beautiful gate of the temple;
66263 ^ and they were filled with wonder and amazement
66268 ^ at that having happened to him.
66272 ^ is clinging now he to peter and - john;
66280 ^ ran together all the people to them in the porch
66289 ^ - called solomon’s, greatly amazed.
66293 ^ having seen [it] however, - peter answered to the people:
66301 ^ men, israelites, why wonder you at this?
66307 ^ or on us why you look intently,
66311 ^ as if by [our] own power or godliness
66316 ^ [we] have made
66317 ^ - to walk him?
66320 ^ the god of abraham, and the god of isaac, and the god jacob, the god of the fathers of us, has glorified the servant of him, jesus,
66341 ^ whom you indeed betrayed
66345 ^ and disowned in [the] presence of pilate,
66350 ^ having adjudged that one
66352 ^ to release [him].
66353 ^ you however the holy and righteous one denied,
66360 ^ and requested
66362 ^ a man, a murderer, to be granted to you;
66366 ^ - and
66368 ^ the author - of life you killed,
66372 ^ whom - god has raised up out from [the] dead,
66378 ^ whereof we
66380 ^ witnesses are.
66382 ^ and on the faith in the name of him, this [man]
66390 ^ whom you see
66392 ^ and know has strengthened the name of him;
66398 ^ and the faith which [is] through him has given to him the complete soundness this before all of you.
66412 ^ and now, brothers, i know
66416 ^ that in ignorance you acted,
66420 ^ as also the rulers of you.
66425 ^ - but
66427 ^ god
66428 ^ what he foretold by [the] mouth of all the prophets,
66435 ^ [that] should suffer the christ of him, he has fulfilled thus.
66441 ^ repent, therefore,
66443 ^ and turn again,
66445 ^ for the blotting out of your - sins,
66451 ^ so that - may come times of refreshing from [the] presence of the lord,
66460 ^ and [that] he may send the [one]
66463 ^ having been appointed to you, christ jesus,
66467 ^ whom it behooves heaven indeed to receive, until [the] times of restoration of all things,
66476 ^ of which spoke - god by [the] mouth of holy from [the] age his prophets.
66488 ^ moses indeed said
66491 ^ -, a prophet to you will raise up [the] lord the god of you out from the brothers of you, like me;
66505 ^ him you will listen to in all things,
66509 ^ as many as - he might say to you.
66514 ^ it will be [that] now
66516 ^ every soul
66518 ^ who, if not might heed the prophet that, will be utterly destroyed out from the people.’
66529 ^ and all now
66532 ^ the prophets from samuel, and those subsequently,
66539 ^ as many as have spoken, also have announced the days these.
66546 ^ you are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant
66555 ^ that made - god with the fathers of you,
66563 ^ saying to abraham,
66566 ^ and in the seed of you will be blessed all the families of the earth.’
66577 ^ to you first,
66579 ^ having raised up - god the servant of him, sent him,
66587 ^ blessing you
66589 ^ in - turning away each from the wickednesses of you.
66597 ^ speaking now of them to the people,
66603 ^ came upon them the priests and the captain of the temple and the sadducees,
66615 ^ being distressed
66616 ^ because of - teaching their the people
66622 ^ and proclaiming in - jesus the resurrection - out from [the] dead;
66632 ^ and they laid on them the hands
66637 ^ and put [them] in custody until the next day;
66644 ^ it was for evening already.
66648 ^ many however
66650 ^ of those having heard the word believed,
66655 ^ and became the number of the men about thousand five.
66664 ^ it came to pass then
66666 ^ on the next day were gathered together their - rulers and - elders and - scribes in jerusalem,
66681 ^ and annas the high priest, and caiaphas, and john, and alexander,
66691 ^ and as many as were of descent high-priestly.
66697 ^ and
66698 ^ having placed them in the midst, they began to inquire,
66704 ^ in what power or in what name did this you?
66714 ^ then peter,
66716 ^ having been filled with [the] spirit holy, said to them,
66722 ^ rulers of the people and elders, if we this day are being examined as to a good work [to the] man ailing,
66735 ^ by what [means] he has been healed,
66739 ^ known let it be to all you and to all the people of israel
66748 ^ that in the name of jesus christ of nazareth,
66756 ^ whom you crucified,
66759 ^ whom - god raised out from [the] dead,
66765 ^ in him this [man] stands before you sound.
66772 ^ this is the stone
66776 ^ - having been rejected by you, the builders,
66782 ^ which has become into head of [the] corner.’
66787 ^ and not there is in other no one the salvation,
66795 ^ not for name is there
66799 ^ another under - heaven
66803 ^ - having been given among men
66807 ^ by which it behooves
66810 ^ to be saved us.
66812 ^ seeing now
66814 ^ the - of peter boldness,
66818 ^ and of john,
66820 ^ and having understood
66822 ^ that men unschooled they are,
66826 ^ and ordinary, they were astonished.
66829 ^ they recognized then them,
66832 ^ that with - jesus they had been.
66837 ^ - and the man beholding
66841 ^ with them standing
66844 ^ - having been healed, nothing they had
66848 ^ to contradict.
66849 ^ having commanded however them
66852 ^ outside the council to go, they began to confer with one another,
66859 ^ saying,
66860 ^ what shall we do to the men these?
66865 ^ that truly for a noteworthy sign has come to pass through them,
66873 ^ to all those inhabiting jerusalem [is] evident,
66878 ^ and not we are able
66881 ^ to deny [it].
66882 ^ but that not on further it might spread among the people,
66891 ^ let us warn them
66893 ^ no longer to speak in the name this to no man.
66901 ^ and
66902 ^ having called them, they commanded [them]
66905 ^ - at all not to speak
66909 ^ nor to teach in the name - of jesus.
66916 ^ - but
66918 ^ peter and john
66921 ^ answering, said to them,
66925 ^ whether right it is before - god
66931 ^ to you to listen, rather than - god,
66937 ^ you must judge;
66938 ^ not are able for we,
66942 ^ what we have seen
66944 ^ and heard, not to speak.
66948 ^ - and
66950 ^ having further threatened [them], they let go them,
66953 ^ nothing finding
66955 ^ the how
66957 ^ they might punish them, on account of the people,
66962 ^ because all were glorifying - god
66967 ^ for that having happened;
66970 ^ years [old] for was
66973 ^ more than forty, the man
66977 ^ on whom had taken place the sign this of healing.
66985 ^ having been let go now, they came to the own
66991 ^ and reported
66993 ^ how much to them the chief priests and the elders had said.
67002 ^ - and
67004 ^ having heard, with one accord they lifted up [their] voice to - god
67011 ^ and said,
67013 ^ sovereign lord, you
67015 ^ - made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all that [is] in them,
67030 ^ - of the father of us by [the] spirit holy
67037 ^ through [the] mouth david servant of you
67041 ^ having spoken
67042 ^ -: why did rage [the] gentiles,
67045 ^ and peoples did devise vain things?
67049 ^ took [their] stand the kings of the earth,
67054 ^ and the rulers were gathered together - themselves against the lord and against the christ of him.’
67069 ^ were gathered together for in truth, in the city this, against the holy servant of you jesus
67083 ^ whom you anointed, herod both and pontius pilate, with [the] gentiles and peoples of israel,
67095 ^ to do
67096 ^ whatever the hand of you and the purpose of you had determined beforehand
67105 ^ to happen.
67106 ^ and - now, lord, look upon the threats of them,
67115 ^ and grant to the servants of you
67120 ^ with boldness all to speak the word of you,
67127 ^ in that the hand of you
67132 ^ stretch out you
67134 ^ for healing, and signs and wonders to take place, through the name of the holy servant of you, jesus.
67149 ^ and having prayed they,
67152 ^ was shaken the place
67155 ^ in which they were
67158 ^ assembled,
67159 ^ and they were filled with all the holy spirit
67165 ^ and were speaking the word - of god with boldness.
67173 ^ - and
67175 ^ the multitude
67176 ^ - having believed were [in] heart and soul one,
67183 ^ and not one
67186 ^ anything
67187 ^ of that which possessed he, claimed
67191 ^ his own to be,
67193 ^ but were to them all things in common.
67198 ^ and [with] power great, were giving - testimony the apostles
67206 ^ of the resurrection; of the lord jesus
67211 ^ grace then
67213 ^ abundant was upon all them.
67218 ^ not even for in need anyone there was among them;
67225 ^ as many as for owners of lands or houses were
67232 ^ selling [them], were bringing the proceeds
67236 ^ of what is sold,
67238 ^ and were laying [them] at the feet of the apostles;
67245 ^ distribution was made then to each
67248 ^ just as - anyone need had.
67253 ^ joseph now
67255 ^ - having been called barnabas by the apostles
67261 ^ which is
67263 ^ translated son of encouragement a levite, a cypriot at the birth,
67270 ^ owns by him a field,
67273 ^ having sold [it], brought the money
67277 ^ and laid [it] at the feet of the apostles.
67284 ^ a man now
67286 ^ certain, ananias named, with sapphira, the wife of him, sold a property,
67296 ^ and he kept back from the proceeds,
67301 ^ being aware of [it] also the wife,
67305 ^ and
67306 ^ having brought a portion certain, at the feet of the apostles he laid [it].
67315 ^ said however - peter,
67319 ^ ananias, because of why has filled - satan the heart of you
67328 ^ to lie to [for] you the spirit - holy
67334 ^ and to keep back from the proceeds of the land?
67341 ^ not
67342 ^ remaining to you did it remain?
67345 ^ and
67346 ^ having been sold, in the own authority it was?
67352 ^ why
67353 ^ - did you purpose in the heart of you the deed this?
67362 ^ not you have lied to men,
67365 ^ but - to god!
67368 ^ hearing now - ananias the words these,
67375 ^ having fallen down, he breathed his last.
67377 ^ and came fear great
67381 ^ upon all those hearing.
67385 ^ having arisen then, the younger [men] covered him,
67391 ^ and
67392 ^ having carried [him] out, buried [him].
67394 ^ it came to pass now about hours three afterward,
67400 ^ also the wife of him,
67404 ^ not knowing
67406 ^ that having come to pass, came in.
67409 ^ replied then to her peter,
67414 ^ tell me
67416 ^ if for so much, the land you sold?
67421 ^ - and she said,
67424 ^ yes,
67425 ^ for so much.
67426 ^ - but
67428 ^ peter [said] to her,
67431 ^ why [is it]
67432 ^ that have agreed together you
67435 ^ to test the spirit of [the] lord?
67439 ^ behold,
67440 ^ the feet
67442 ^ of those having buried the husband of you [are] at the door,
67450 ^ and they will carry out you.
67453 ^ she fell down then immediately at the feet of him
67460 ^ and breathed her last.
67462 ^ having come in then, the young [men] found her dead;
67469 ^ and
67470 ^ having carried out, they buried [her] by the husband of her.
67476 ^ and came fear great upon all the church
67484 ^ and upon all those hearing these things.
67490 ^ by now
67492 ^ the hands of the apostles were happening signs and wonders many among the people.
67504 ^ and they were with one accord, all in the colonnade of solomon;
67512 ^ of the now
67514 ^ rest, no one dared
67517 ^ to join them,
67519 ^ but were magnifying them the people;
67524 ^ more now were added
67527 ^ believing in the lord,
67530 ^ multitudes of men both, and women,
67535 ^ so as even into the streets to bring out the sick,
67543 ^ and to put [them] on cots and mats,
67549 ^ that coming of peter,
67552 ^ at least the shadow might envelop some of them.
67558 ^ were coming together now also the multitude from the surrounding cities
67566 ^ jerusalem,
67567 ^ bringing [the] sick
67569 ^ and [those] being tormented by spirits unclean,
67574 ^ who were healed
67576 ^ all.
67577 ^ having risen up however the high priest and all those with him,
67586 ^ - being the sect of the sadducees, were filled with jealousy,
67593 ^ and they laid the hands on the apostles
67600 ^ and put them in [the] jail public.
67606 ^ an angel however
67608 ^ of [the] lord, during the night
67611 ^ having opened the doors of the prison, having brought out then them,
67619 ^ said,
67620 ^ go,
67621 ^ and
67622 ^ having stood, speak in the temple to the people all the words of the life this.
67635 ^ having heard now, they entered at the dawn into the temple
67644 ^ and were teaching.
67646 ^ having come now the high priest and those with him, they called together the council, even all the senate of the sons of israel,
67664 ^ and sent to the prison house
67669 ^ to bring them.
67671 ^ - and
67673 ^ having come, [the] officers not did find them in the prison;
67681 ^ having returned then they reported back,
67684 ^ saying
67685 ^ -, the prison house we found
67689 ^ shut, with all security, and the guards
67696 ^ standing before the doors;
67700 ^ having opened [them] however, inside no one we found.
67705 ^ when now they heard the words these,
67711 ^ - both
67713 ^ the captain of the temple and the chief priests were perplexed concerning them,
67722 ^ what - might be this.
67726 ^ having come then, a certain one reported to them
67731 ^ -, behold,
67733 ^ the men
67735 ^ whom you put in the prison are
67741 ^ in the temple, standing
67745 ^ and teaching the people!
67749 ^ then
67750 ^ having gone, the captain with the officers was bringing them,
67758 ^ not with force;
67761 ^ they were afraid of for the people
67765 ^ lest they might be stoned.
67767 ^ having brought then them, they set [them] in the council.
67774 ^ and asked them the high priest,
67779 ^ saying,
67780 ^ not by a charge we commanded you
67784 ^ not to teach in the name this?
67790 ^ and behold,
67792 ^ you have filled - jerusalem with the teaching of you,
67798 ^ and you intend
67800 ^ to bring upon us the blood of the man this.
67808 ^ answering however, peter and the apostles said,
67815 ^ to obey it is necessary god, rather than men.
67821 ^ the god of the fathers of us raised up jesus,
67828 ^ whom you killed,
67831 ^ having hanged [him] on a tree.
67834 ^ him - god [as] prince and savior exalted by the right hand of him,
67844 ^ - to give repentance - to israel
67849 ^ and forgiveness of sins.
67852 ^ and we are witnesses of the things these,
67859 ^ and also the spirit - holy,
67864 ^ whom has given - god
67868 ^ to those obeying him.
67871 ^ - and
67873 ^ having heard, they were cut [to the heart]
67875 ^ and were desiring
67877 ^ to put to death them.
67879 ^ having risen up however a certain [man] in the council, a pharisee named gamaliel, a teacher of the law honored by all the people, he commanded [them]
67894 ^ outside for a short while the men to put.
67899 ^ he said then to them,
67903 ^ men, israelites, take heed to yourselves with the men these,
67911 ^ what you are about to do.
67914 ^ before for
67916 ^ these - days rose up theudas,
67921 ^ affirming
67922 ^ to be somebody himself,
67925 ^ to whom were joined of men number
67929 ^ about four hundred,
67931 ^ who was put to death,
67933 ^ and all,
67935 ^ as many as were persuaded by him, were dispersed,
67939 ^ and it came to nothing.
67943 ^ after this man rose up judas the galilean in the days of the registration
67954 ^ and drew away people after him.
67959 ^ and he perished,
67961 ^ and all
67963 ^ as many as were persuaded by him, were scattered.
67967 ^ and - now i say to you,
67972 ^ withdraw from the men these,
67977 ^ and let alone them,
67980 ^ for if be from men, the plan this or the work this,
67992 ^ it will be overthrown;
67993 ^ if however from god it is,
67998 ^ not you will be able
68000 ^ to overthrow them,
68002 ^ lest ever also fighting against god you would be found.
68006 ^ they were persuaded now by him;
68009 ^ and
68010 ^ having called in the apostles,
68013 ^ having beaten, they commanded [them]
68015 ^ not to speak in the name - of jesus,
68022 ^ and released [them].
68024 ^ they indeed therefore departed,
68028 ^ rejoicing, from [the] presence of the council,
68033 ^ that they had been counted worthy
68035 ^ for the name to suffer dishonor.
68039 ^ every then
68041 ^ day, in the temple and in house, not they ceased
68050 ^ teaching
68051 ^ and proclaiming the good news that the christ [is] jesus.
68056 ^ in now
68058 ^ the days these, [as] are multiplying the disciples,
68064 ^ there arose a grumbling of the hellenists against the hebrews,
68071 ^ because were being overlooked in the distribution - daily the widows of them.
68081 ^ having called near then the twelve the multitude of the disciples, they said,
68090 ^ not desirable it is [for]
68093 ^ us,
68094 ^ having neglected the word - of god, to attend tables.
68101 ^ select therefore, brothers, men out from yourselves
68107 ^ being well attested, seven full of [the] spirit and wisdom,
68113 ^ whom we will appoint over the task this.
68119 ^ we now in the prayer and the ministry of the word will steadfastly continue.
68129 ^ and was pleasing the statement before all the multitude;
68137 ^ and they chose stephen, a man full of faith and [of the] spirit holy, and philip, and prochorus, and nicanor, and timon, and parmenas, and nicolas a convert of antioch,
68160 ^ whom they set before the apostles;
68165 ^ and
68166 ^ having prayed, they laid on them the hands.
68171 ^ and the word - of god continued to increase,
68177 ^ and was multiplied the number of the disciples in jerusalem exceedingly;
68186 ^ a great then
68188 ^ multitude of the priests were becoming obedient to the faith.
68194 ^ stephen now,
68196 ^ full grace and power, was performing wonders and signs great among the people.
68208 ^ arose however certain of those from the synagogue
68215 ^ - called freedmen, including cyrenians and alexandrians and of those from cilicia and asia,
68228 ^ disputing with stephen.
68231 ^ and not they were able
68234 ^ to withstand the wisdom and the spirit
68240 ^ by whom he was speaking.
68242 ^ then they suborned men,
68245 ^ saying
68246 ^ -, we have heard him
68249 ^ speaking words blasphemous against moses and - god.
68257 ^ they stirred up then the people and the elders and the scribes,
68267 ^ and
68268 ^ having come upon [him], they seized him
68271 ^ and brought [him] to the council.
68276 ^ they set also witnesses false,
68280 ^ saying,
68281 ^ the man this, not does stop
68286 ^ speaking words against the place - holy this and the law;
68297 ^ we have heard for him
68300 ^ saying
68301 ^ that jesus of nazareth this will destroy the place this
68310 ^ and will change the customs
68314 ^ that delivered to us moses.
68318 ^ and
68319 ^ having looked intently on him,
68322 ^ all - sitting in the council saw the face of him as [the] face of an angel.
68335 ^ said then the high priest,
68339 ^ if these things so are?
68343 ^ - and he began to speak:
68346 ^ men, brothers, and fathers, listen!
68351 ^ the god - of glory appeared to the father of us abraham,
68360 ^ being in - mesopotamia,
68364 ^ before rather dwelling his in haran,
68370 ^ and he said to him,
68374 ^ go out from the country of you and from the kindred of you,
68384 ^ and come into the land
68389 ^ which - to you i will show.’
68393 ^ then
68394 ^ having gone out from [the] land of chaldeans, he dwelt in haran.
68401 ^ and from there,
68402 ^ after - died the father of him, he removed him into the land this,
68414 ^ in which you now dwell.
68419 ^ and not he did give to him an inheritance in it,
68426 ^ not even [the] length of a foot;
68429 ^ but he promised
68431 ^ to give to him for a possession it,
68436 ^ and to the descendants of him after him,
68442 ^ not there being to him a child.
68446 ^ spoke however thus - god
68451 ^ that will be the seed of him a sojourner in a land strange,
68460 ^ and they will enslave it,
68463 ^ and will mistreat [it] years four hundred.
68467 ^ and the nation
68470 ^ to which if they will be in bondage, will judge i,
68475 ^ - god said,
68478 ^ and after these things they will come forth
68482 ^ and will serve me in the place this.’
68489 ^ and he gave to him [the] covenant of circumcision;
68494 ^ and thus he begat - isaac
68499 ^ and circumcised him on the day - eighth;
68506 ^ and isaac - jacob,
68510 ^ and jacob the twelve patriarchs.
68515 ^ and the patriarchs,
68518 ^ having envied - joseph, sold [him] into egypt.
68524 ^ but was - god with him,
68530 ^ and rescued him out of all the tribulations of him,
68538 ^ and gave him favor and wisdom before pharaoh, king of egypt;
68548 ^ and he appointed him
68551 ^ ruler over egypt, and over all the house of him.
68560 ^ came then a famine upon all - of egypt and canaan,
68569 ^ and affliction great,
68572 ^ and not were finding sustenance the fathers of us.
68579 ^ having heard now jacob [there] is grain in egypt, he sent forth the fathers of us first;
68591 ^ and on the second time, was made known joseph to brothers of him,
68600 ^ and known became - to pharaoh the family - of joseph.
68609 ^ having sent then joseph, he called for jacob, the father of him, and all the kindred, in all souls seventy five.
68625 ^ and went down jacob into egypt
68630 ^ and died, he
68633 ^ and the fathers of us,
68637 ^ and they were carried over into shechem
68641 ^ and were placed in the tomb
68646 ^ which had bought abraham for a sum of silver from the sons of hamor in shechem.
68657 ^ as now was drawing near the time of the promise
68664 ^ that had made - god - to abraham,
68670 ^ increased the people
68673 ^ and multiplied in egypt,
68677 ^ until that there arose king another over egypt,
68684 ^ who not knew - joseph.
68689 ^ he
68690 ^ having dealt treacherously with the race of us, he mistreated the fathers of us,
68698 ^ - making [them] the infants abandon
68703 ^ of them
68704 ^ unto the not
68707 ^ they would live.
68708 ^ in that time was born moses,
68713 ^ and he was beautiful - to god,
68718 ^ who was brought up months three in the house of the father.
68727 ^ having been set outside then he,
68730 ^ took up him the daughter of pharaoh,
68735 ^ and brought up him for herself for a son.
68741 ^ and was instructed moses in all [the] wisdom of [the] egyptians;
68748 ^ he was now mighty in words and deeds of him.
68756 ^ when then was fulfilled to him of forty years a period,
68762 ^ it came into the mind of him
68767 ^ to visit the brothers of him, the sons of israel.
68774 ^ and
68775 ^ having seen a certain one
68777 ^ being wronged, he defended [him]
68779 ^ and did vengeance
68782 ^ for the [one] being oppressed,
68784 ^ having struck down the egyptian.
68787 ^ he was supposing now
68789 ^ to understand the brothers of him
68793 ^ that - god by [the] hand of him is giving salvation them,
68802 ^ - but not they understood.
68806 ^ on the and
68808 ^ following day, he appeared to those who
68812 ^ were quarreling
68813 ^ and urged them to peace,
68818 ^ having said,
68819 ^ men, brothers you are.
68822 ^ so that why wrong you one another?
68825 ^ the [one] however mistreating the neighbor pushed away him,
68832 ^ having said,
68833 ^ who you appointed, ruler and judge over us?
68841 ^ not
68842 ^ to kill me you desire,
68846 ^ the same way you put to death yesterday the egyptian?’
68852 ^ fled then moses at the remark this,
68859 ^ and became exiled in [the] land of midian,
68865 ^ where he begat sons two.
68869 ^ and having been passed years forty,
68873 ^ appeared to him in the wilderness of the mount sinai an angel in a flame of fire of a bush.
68886 ^ - and
68888 ^ moses
68889 ^ having seen [it], marveled at the vision;
68893 ^ coming near then of him
68896 ^ to behold [it],
68897 ^ there was [the] voice of [the] lord:
68900 ^ i [am] the god of the fathers of you, the god of abraham, and of isaac, and of jacob.’
68913 ^ terrified then having become moses, not he dared
68919 ^ to look.
68920 ^ said then to him the lord,
68925 ^ take off the sandal of the feet of you,
68931 ^ - for
68933 ^ the place
68934 ^ on which you stand, ground holy is.
68940 ^ having seen, i saw the oppression of the people of me - in egypt,
68950 ^ and the groans of them i have heard,
68955 ^ and i have come down
68957 ^ to deliver them;
68959 ^ and now come,
68962 ^ i will send you to egypt.’
68966 ^ this - moses,
68969 ^ whom they rejected,
68971 ^ having said,
68972 ^ who you appointed ruler and judge?’ —
68978 ^ him whom god [as] and ruler and redeemer sent by [the] hand of [the] angel
68989 ^ - having appeared to him in the bush —
68995 ^ this one led out them,
68998 ^ having done wonders and signs in [the] land of egypt, and in [the] red sea, and in the wilderness years forty.
69015 ^ this is the moses
69019 ^ - having said to the sons of israel,
69024 ^ a prophet for you will raise up - god out from the brothers of you, like me.’
69035 ^ this is
69037 ^ the [one] having been in the congregation in the wilderness, with the angel
69048 ^ - speaking to him in the mount sinai, and of the fathers of us,
69059 ^ who received oracles
69062 ^ living
69063 ^ to give to us,
69065 ^ to whom not were willing obedient to be the fathers of us,
69073 ^ but thrust away,
69075 ^ and turned back in the hearts of them to egypt,
69083 ^ having said - to aaron,
69086 ^ make us gods
69089 ^ who will go before us.
69092 ^ - as for
69094 ^ moses this,
69096 ^ who brought out us from [the] land of egypt,
69102 ^ not we know
69104 ^ what has happened to him.’
69107 ^ and they made a calf in the days those
69113 ^ and offered a sacrifice to the idol,
69118 ^ and they were rejoicing in the works of the hands of them.
69126 ^ turned away however - god
69130 ^ and delivered them
69133 ^ to worship the host of heaven,
69138 ^ as it has been written in [the] book of the prophets:
69144 ^ not slain beasts and sacrifices did you offer to me, years forty in the wilderness, o house of israel?
69157 ^ and you took up the tabernacle - of moloch, and the star of the god of you rephan, the images
69172 ^ that you made
69174 ^ to worship them;
69176 ^ and i will remove you beyond babylon.’
69181 ^ the tabernacle of the testimony was with fathers of us in the wilderness,
69192 ^ just as had commanded
69194 ^ the [one] speaking - to moses,
69198 ^ to make it according to the pattern
69203 ^ that he had seen,
69205 ^ which also brought [it], having received by succession, the fathers of us, with joshua in the taking possession of the nations
69219 ^ whom drove out - god from [the] face of the fathers of us, until the days of david,
69232 ^ who found favor before - god
69238 ^ and asked
69240 ^ to find a dwelling place for the house of jacob.
69245 ^ solomon however built him [the] house.
69250 ^ yet not the most high in hand-made [houses] dwells.
69257 ^ as the prophet says:
69261 ^ - heaven [is] to me a throne,
69265 ^ - and
69267 ^ the earth a footstool of the feet of me.
69272 ^ what kind of house will you build me,
69276 ^ says [the] lord,
69278 ^ or what [is] [the] place of the rest of me?
69284 ^ not the hand of me has made these things all?’
69291 ^ stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and - ears, you always the spirit - holy resist;
69305 ^ as the fathers of you,
69309 ^ also you.
69311 ^ which of the prophets not did persecute the fathers of you?
69319 ^ and they killed
69321 ^ those having foretold about the coming of the righteous one,
69328 ^ of whom now you
69331 ^ betrayers and murderers have become,
69335 ^ who received the law by [the] ordination of angels,
69342 ^ and not have kept [it].
69345 ^ hearing now these things, they were cut in the hearts of them
69352 ^ and began gnashing the teeth at him.
69358 ^ he being however full of [the] spirit holy,
69363 ^ having looked intently into - heaven, saw [the] glory of god and jesus
69372 ^ standing at the right hand - of god,
69377 ^ and he said,
69379 ^ behold,
69380 ^ i see the heavens
69383 ^ having been opened, and the son - of man
69389 ^ at the right [hand] standing
69392 ^ - of god.
69394 ^ having cried out then in a voice loud, they held the ears of them
69402 ^ and rushed with one accord upon him,
69407 ^ and
69408 ^ having cast [him] out of the city, they began to stone [him].
69413 ^ and the witnesses laid aside the garments of them at the feet of a young man
69424 ^ named saul.
69426 ^ and [as] they were stoning - stephen,
69430 ^ he was calling out
69431 ^ and saying,
69433 ^ lord jesus, receive the spirit of me.
69439 ^ having fallen then on [his] knees, he cried in a voice loud,
69446 ^ lord, not place to them this - sin.
69453 ^ and
69454 ^ this having said, he fell asleep.
69457 ^ saul now was there
69460 ^ consenting to the killing of him.
69464 ^ arose then on that - day a persecution great against the church which [was] in jerusalem.
69478 ^ all then were scattered throughout the regions - of judea and samaria, except the apostles.
69491 ^ buried now - stephen men devout,
69497 ^ and made lamentation great over him.
69503 ^ saul however was destroying the church;
69508 ^ [houses] after - houses entering,
69512 ^ dragging off then men and women, he was delivering [them] to prison.
69520 ^ those indeed therefore
69523 ^ having been scattered went about,
69525 ^ preaching the word.
69528 ^ philip now,
69530 ^ having gone down to - [a] city - of samaria, was proclaiming to them the christ.
69540 ^ were giving heed now the crowds
69544 ^ to the things being spoken by - philip with one accord,
69550 ^ in the [time] to hear them
69554 ^ and to see the signs
69558 ^ that he was performing.
69560 ^ many for
69562 ^ of those having spirits unclean,
69566 ^ crying voice in a loud, they were coming out [of them];
69570 ^ many now,
69572 ^ having been paralyzed and lame, were healed.
69576 ^ there was then great joy in the city that.
69584 ^ a man now
69586 ^ certain, named simon, had been formerly
69590 ^ in the city practicing sorcery
69594 ^ and amazing the people - of samaria,
69600 ^ declaring
69601 ^ to be someone himself
69604 ^ great,
69605 ^ to whom were giving heed all, from small to great,
69612 ^ saying,
69613 ^ this one is the power - of god
69619 ^ that [is] called great.
69622 ^ they were giving heed now to him,
69625 ^ because the long time with the magic arts he had amazed them.
69633 ^ when however they believed - philip,
69638 ^ proclaiming the gospel concerning the kingdom - of god, and the name of jesus christ,
69649 ^ they were baptized, men both and women.
69654 ^ - and
69656 ^ simon also
69658 ^ himself believed,
69660 ^ and
69661 ^ having been baptized, was
69663 ^ steadfastly continuing - with philip.
69666 ^ beholding then [the] signs and miracles great
69672 ^ being performed, he was amazed.
69674 ^ having heard now the in jerusalem apostles
69680 ^ that had received - samaria the word - of god, they sent to them peter and john,
69694 ^ who
69695 ^ having come down, prayed for them
69699 ^ that they might receive [the] spirit holy.
69703 ^ not yet for he was
69706 ^ upon any of them fallen;
69710 ^ only however
69712 ^ baptized they had been into the name of the lord jesus.
69720 ^ then they began laying the hands upon them,
69726 ^ and they received [the] spirit holy.
69730 ^ having seen now - of simon
69734 ^ that through the laying on of the hands of the apostles was given the spirit, he offered to them money,
69748 ^ saying,
69749 ^ give also to me the authority this,
69754 ^ that
69755 ^ on whom if i may lay the hands, he may receive [the] spirit holy.
69763 ^ peter however said to him,
69768 ^ the silver of you, with you may it be to destruction,
69776 ^ because
69777 ^ the gift - of god you thought by money to be obtained!
69785 ^ no there is to you part,
69789 ^ nor lot, in the matter this;
69795 ^ the for
69797 ^ heart of you not is right before - god.
69805 ^ repent therefore of the wickedness of yours this,
69812 ^ and pray earnestly to the lord,
69816 ^ if indeed will be forgiven you the intent of the heart of you;
69825 ^ in for
69827 ^ [the] gall of bitterness and [the] bond of iniquity, i see
69833 ^ you
69834 ^ being.
69835 ^ answering now, - simon said,
69840 ^ pray earnestly you on behalf of me to the lord,
69847 ^ so that nothing may come upon me
69852 ^ of which you have spoken.
69854 ^ they indeed therefore
69857 ^ having earnestly testified,
69858 ^ and having spoken the word of the lord, traveled back to jerusalem,
69867 ^ to many then
69869 ^ villages of the samaritans they were preaching the gospel.
69873 ^ an angel now
69875 ^ of [the] lord spoke to philip,
69879 ^ saying,
69880 ^ rise up
69881 ^ and go toward [the] south, to the road
69888 ^ - going down from jerusalem to gaza.
69894 ^ this is [the] desert [road].
69897 ^ and
69898 ^ having risen up, he went.
69900 ^ and behold,
69902 ^ a man an ethiopian, a eunuch, a potentate of candace queen of [the] ethiopians,
69909 ^ who was over all the treasure of her,
69916 ^ who had come
69918 ^ to worship to jerusalem,
69921 ^ he was then
69923 ^ returning
69924 ^ and sitting in the chariot of him,
69930 ^ and he was reading the prophet isaiah.
69935 ^ said then the spirit - to philip,
69941 ^ go near
69942 ^ and join yourself to the chariot this.
69947 ^ having run up then, - philip heard him
69953 ^ reading isaiah the prophet,
69957 ^ and said,
69959 ^ then also understand you
69962 ^ what you are reading?
69964 ^ - and he said,
69967 ^ how for - could i be able
69971 ^ if not someone will guide me?
69976 ^ he invited then - philip,
69980 ^ having come up, to sit with him.
69984 ^ - now
69986 ^ the passage of the scripture
69989 ^ which he was reading was this:
69993 ^ as a sheep to slaughter he was led,
69998 ^ and as a lamb
70001 ^ before the [one] shearing him [is] silent,
70006 ^ so not he opens the mouth of him. in the humiliation of him,
70016 ^ - justice from him was taken away.
70020 ^ the generation of him, who will describe?
70025 ^ for is removed from the earth the life of him.”
70033 ^ answering now, the eunuch - to philip said,
70040 ^ i pray you,
70042 ^ concerning whom the prophet says this?
70048 ^ concerning himself,
70050 ^ or concerning other some?
70054 ^ having opened then - philip
70058 ^ the mouth of him
70061 ^ and having begun from the scripture this, he proclaimed the good news to him — - jesus.
70071 ^ as then they were going along the road,
70077 ^ they came upon some water,
70081 ^ and says the eunuch,
70085 ^ behold
70086 ^ water;
70087 ^ what prevents
70089 ^ me to be baptized?”
70091 ^ and he commanded
70093 ^ to stop the chariot.
70096 ^ and they went down both to the water,
70102 ^ - both philip and the eunuch,
70108 ^ and he baptized him.
70111 ^ when now they came up out of the water,
70117 ^ [the] spirit of [the] lord carried away - philip,
70122 ^ and not saw him no longer the eunuch;
70129 ^ he went for the way of him,
70134 ^ rejoicing.
70135 ^ philip however was found at azotus,
70140 ^ and
70141 ^ passing through, he was proclaiming the gospel to the towns all,
70146 ^ until - coming his to caesarea.
70152 ^ - but
70154 ^ saul,
70155 ^ still breathing out threats and murder toward the disciples of the lord,
70165 ^ having gone to the high priest, requested from him letters in damascus to the synagogues,
70177 ^ so that if any he found
70181 ^ of the way, being men both and women,
70188 ^ having bound, he might bring [them] to jerusalem.
70192 ^ in now - proceeding, it came to pass
70197 ^ [as] he draws near - to damascus,
70201 ^ suddenly also him flashed around a light from - heaven.
70209 ^ and
70210 ^ having fallen on the ground, he heard a voice
70216 ^ saying to him,
70218 ^ saul, saul, why me do you persecute?
70223 ^ he said then,
70225 ^ who are you, lord?
70228 ^ - and [he said],
70230 ^ i am jesus,
70233 ^ whom you are persecuting.
70236 ^ but rise up
70238 ^ and enter into the city,
70243 ^ and it will be told you
70246 ^ that what you it behooves to do.
70251 ^ - and
70253 ^ the men
70254 ^ - traveling with him stood speechless,
70259 ^ hearing indeed the voice,
70263 ^ no one however seeing.
70266 ^ rose up then saul from the ground;
70272 ^ having been opened however the eyes of him,
70277 ^ nothing he could see.
70279 ^ leading by the hand then him, they brought [him] to damascus.
70285 ^ and he was
70287 ^ days three without seeing,
70291 ^ and neither did he eat
70294 ^ nor drink.
70296 ^ there was now a certain disciple in damascus named ananias.
70304 ^ and said to him in a vision the lord,
70312 ^ ananias.
70313 ^ - and he said,
70316 ^ behold
70317 ^ me, lord.
70319 ^ - and
70321 ^ the lord to him [said],
70324 ^ having risen up, go into the street
70329 ^ - called straight,
70332 ^ and seek in [the] house of judas saul named, of tarsus.
70340 ^ behold for
70342 ^ he is praying,
70343 ^ and he saw a man in a vision
70348 ^ ananias named,
70350 ^ having come
70351 ^ and having put on him the hands,
70356 ^ so that he might see again.
70358 ^ answered but ananias,
70361 ^ lord, i have heard from many concerning the man this,
70369 ^ how many evils to saints of you he did in jerusalem;
70377 ^ and here he has authority from the chief priests
70384 ^ to bind
70385 ^ all those calling on the name of you.
70391 ^ said however to him the lord,
70397 ^ go,
70398 ^ for a vessel of choice is
70402 ^ to me this [man],
70404 ^ - to carry the name of me before [the] gentiles, and also kings, [the] sons then of israel;
70417 ^ i for will show to him
70421 ^ how much it behooves him for the name of me to suffer.
70429 ^ went away then ananias
70432 ^ and entered into the house;
70437 ^ and
70438 ^ having laid upon him the hands, he said,
70444 ^ saul brother, the lord has sent me,
70450 ^ jesus,
70451 ^ the [one] having appeared to you on the road
70457 ^ by which you were coming,
70459 ^ that you may see again
70461 ^ and be filled [of the] spirit holy.
70465 ^ and immediately fell of him from the eyes [something] like scales,
70474 ^ he regained his sight also.
70476 ^ and
70477 ^ having risen up, he was baptized;
70479 ^ and
70480 ^ having taken food, he was strengthened.
70483 ^ he was now with the in damascus disciples days some.
70492 ^ and immediately in the synagogues he began proclaiming - jesus,
70500 ^ that he is the son - of god.
70507 ^ were amazed then
70509 ^ all - hearing,
70512 ^ and were saying,
70514 ^ not this is
70517 ^ the [one] having ravaged in jerusalem
70521 ^ those calling on the name this?
70526 ^ and here for this he had come,
70531 ^ that
70532 ^ having been bound, them he might bring to the chief priests.
70538 ^ saul however all the more was empowered,
70542 ^ and kept confounding the jews
70546 ^ - dwelling in damascus,
70550 ^ proving
70551 ^ that this is the christ.
70556 ^ when now had passed days many,
70561 ^ plotted together the jews
70564 ^ to kill him;
70566 ^ became known however - to saul the plot of them.
70573 ^ they were closely watching now also the gates day and also night,
70582 ^ so that him they might kill;
70585 ^ having taken [him] however the disciples of him by night, through the wall they let down him,
70596 ^ having lowered [him] in a basket.
70599 ^ having arrived then in jerusalem, he was attempting
70604 ^ to join the disciples.
70607 ^ and all were afraid of him,
70611 ^ not believing
70613 ^ that he is a disciple.
70616 ^ barnabas however,
70618 ^ having taken him, brought [him] to the apostles,
70624 ^ and he related to them
70627 ^ how on the road he had seen the lord,
70634 ^ and that he had spoken to him,
70638 ^ and how in damascus he had spoken boldly in the name - of jesus.
70648 ^ and he was
70650 ^ with them, coming in
70653 ^ and going out in jerusalem,
70657 ^ speaking boldly in the name of [the] lord.
70663 ^ he was speaking also
70665 ^ and was debating with the hellenists;
70670 ^ - but they were seeking
70673 ^ to kill him.
70675 ^ having known [it] however, the brothers brought down him to caesarea
70683 ^ and sent away him to tarsus.
70688 ^ the indeed then
70691 ^ church throughout all - of judea, and galilee, and samaria, had peace,
70702 ^ being edified
70703 ^ and
70704 ^ going on in the fear of the lord; and in the comfort of the holy spirit they were multiplied.
70716 ^ it came to pass that now
70718 ^ peter,
70719 ^ passing through all [quarters], went down also to the saints
70727 ^ - inhabiting lydda.
70730 ^ he found then there a man certain, named aeneas,
70737 ^ for years eight lying on a bed,
70743 ^ who was
70745 ^ paralyzed.
70746 ^ and said to him - peter,
70751 ^ aeneas, heals you jesus christ;
70756 ^ rise up,
70757 ^ and make the bed for yourself.
70760 ^ and immediately he rose up.
70763 ^ and saw him
70766 ^ all those inhabiting lydda and - sharon,
70773 ^ who turned to the lord.
70778 ^ in joppa now certain there was
70783 ^ a disciple named tabitha,
70786 ^ which
70787 ^ translated is called dorcas.
70790 ^ she was full of works good, and of alms
70797 ^ that she continually did.
70799 ^ it came to pass however,
70801 ^ in the days those,
70805 ^ [that] having become sick, she died.
70808 ^ having washed [her] then, put [her] they in an upper room.
70814 ^ near now being lydda
70818 ^ - joppa,
70820 ^ the disciples,
70822 ^ having heard
70823 ^ that peter is in it, sent two men to him,
70833 ^ imploring ,
70834 ^ not to delay
70836 ^ coming to us.
70839 ^ having risen up then, peter went with them,
70844 ^ who
70845 ^ having arrived, brought [him] into the upper room.
70850 ^ and stood by him
70853 ^ all the widows,
70856 ^ weeping
70857 ^ and
70858 ^ showing [the] tunics and garments
70862 ^ that had made,
70864 ^ with them being, - dorcas.
70869 ^ having put then
70871 ^ outside all - peter,
70875 ^ and having bowed the knees, he prayed.
70880 ^ and
70881 ^ having turned to the body he said,
70886 ^ tabitha, arise!
70888 ^ - and she opened the eyes of her,
70894 ^ and
70895 ^ having seen - peter, she sat up.
70899 ^ having given then her [his] hand, he raised up her.
70905 ^ having called then the saints and the widows, he presented her
70914 ^ living.
70915 ^ known then it became throughout all - of joppa,
70922 ^ and believed many on the lord.
70928 ^ it came to pass then,
70930 ^ days many he stayed in joppa with a certain simon, a tanner.
70939 ^ a man now
70941 ^ certain in caesarea, named cornelius, [was] a centurion of [the] cohort
70949 ^ that is called italian, devout
70953 ^ and fearing - god with all the household of him,
70962 ^ doing alms many to the people,
70967 ^ and praying to god continually all.
70973 ^ he saw in a vision clearly, as if about hour the ninth of the day, an angel - of god
70986 ^ having come to him
70989 ^ and having said to him,
70992 ^ cornelius!
70993 ^ - and
70995 ^ having looked intently on him,
70997 ^ and afraid having become, he said,
71001 ^ what is it, lord?
71004 ^ he said then to him,
71007 ^ the prayers of you and the alms of you have ascended as a memorial before - god.
71020 ^ and now send men to joppa
71026 ^ and summon simon, a man
71030 ^ who is called peter.
71033 ^ he lodges with a certain simon a tanner,
71039 ^ whose is
71041 ^ [the] house by [the] sea.”
71044 ^ when then had departed the angel
71049 ^ - speaking to him,
71052 ^ having called two of the servants and a soldier devout
71059 ^ of those who are attending him,
71062 ^ and having related all things to them, he sent them to - joppa.
71071 ^ on the now
71073 ^ next day, as are journeying these
71076 ^ and the city approaching,
71080 ^ went up peter on the housetop
71085 ^ to pray, about hour the sixth.
71089 ^ he became then hungry
71092 ^ and desired
71094 ^ to eat;
71095 ^ [as] were preparing however they,
71098 ^ fell upon him a trance,
71102 ^ and he beholds - heaven
71106 ^ opening, and
71108 ^ descending a vessel certain,
71111 ^ as a sheet great,
71114 ^ by four corners being let down upon the earth,
71120 ^ in which were all the quadrupeds, and creeping things of the earth, and birds of heaven.
71134 ^ and came a voice to him:
71139 ^ having risen up, peter, kill
71142 ^ and eat!
71144 ^ - and
71146 ^ peter said,
71148 ^ in no way, lord;
71150 ^ for never have i eaten anything common or unclean.
71157 ^ and a voice [came] again for the second time to him:
71164 ^ what - god has cleansed, you not call common.
71171 ^ this now took place for three times,
71176 ^ and immediately was taken up the vessel into - heaven.
71184 ^ while then in himself was perplexed - peter
71191 ^ what - might be the vision
71196 ^ that he had seen,
71198 ^ behold,
71199 ^ the men
71201 ^ - having been sent from - cornelius,
71206 ^ having inquired for the house - of simon, stood at the gate.
71215 ^ and
71216 ^ having called out, they were asking
71218 ^ if simon
71220 ^ who [is] called peter here is lodged.
71225 ^ - and
71227 ^ of peter thinking over the vision,
71232 ^ said to him the spirit,
71236 ^ behold,
71237 ^ men three
71239 ^ are seeking you.
71241 ^ but
71242 ^ having risen, go down
71244 ^ and proceed with them,
71248 ^ nothing doubting,
71250 ^ because i have sent them.
71254 ^ having gone down then peter to the men, he said,
71261 ^ behold,
71262 ^ i am
71264 ^ whom you seek;
71266 ^ what [is] the cause
71269 ^ for which you are here?
71272 ^ - and they said,
71275 ^ cornelius a centurion, a man righteous
71279 ^ and fearing - god,
71283 ^ being well testified to then by all the nation of the jews, was divinely instructed by an angel holy
71295 ^ to send for you to the house of him,
71301 ^ and to hear a message from you.
71306 ^ having called in therefore them he lodged [them].
71310 ^ on the now
71312 ^ next day
71313 ^ having risen up, he went forth with them,
71317 ^ and some of the brothers those from joppa went with him.
71326 ^ on the now
71328 ^ next day, he entered into - caesarea,
71333 ^ - and
71335 ^ cornelius was
71337 ^ expecting them,
71339 ^ having called together the relatives of him and - close friends.
71347 ^ as then was
71350 ^ - entering - peter,
71354 ^ having met him - cornelius,
71358 ^ having fallen at the feet, worshiped [him].
71363 ^ - but
71365 ^ peter lifted up him,
71368 ^ saying,
71369 ^ rise up,
71370 ^ also i myself a man am.
71375 ^ and
71376 ^ talking with him, he entered,
71379 ^ and he finds
71381 ^ having gathered together many.
71383 ^ he was saying then to them,
71387 ^ you know
71389 ^ how unlawful it is
71392 ^ for a man a jew
71394 ^ to unite himself
71395 ^ or to come near to a foreigner.
71398 ^ to me however god has shown,
71402 ^ not common or unclean to call
71407 ^ man.
71408 ^ therefore also without objection i came,
71412 ^ having been summoned.
71413 ^ i inquire therefore,
71415 ^ for what reason did you summon me?
71419 ^ and - cornelius was saying,
71423 ^ ago four days, until this the hour, i was
71431 ^ at the ninth hour praying in the house of me;
71438 ^ and behold,
71440 ^ a man stood before me in apparel bright,
71447 ^ and said,
71449 ^ cornelius, has been heard your - prayer,
71454 ^ and the alms of you have been remembered before - god.
71462 ^ send therefore to joppa
71466 ^ and call for simon,
71469 ^ who is called peter;
71472 ^ he lodges in [the] house of simon, a tanner by [the] sea.
71480 ^ at once therefore i sent to you;
71485 ^ you then well did,
71489 ^ having come.
71490 ^ now therefore, all we before - god are present
71498 ^ to hear
71499 ^ all the things having been commanded you by the lord.
71506 ^ having opened then peter the mouth, he said,
71512 ^ of a truth i understand
71515 ^ that not is one who shows partiality - god,
71521 ^ but in every nation,
71525 ^ the [one] fearing him
71528 ^ and working righteousness, acceptable to him is,
71534 ^ the word
71536 ^ that he sent to the sons of israel,
71541 ^ proclaiming the gospel, peace by jesus christ —
71546 ^ he is of all lord.
71550 ^ you yourselves know the having come declaration through all - judea,
71559 ^ having begun from - galilee, after the baptism
71566 ^ that proclaimed john:
71569 ^ jesus - from nazareth,
71573 ^ how anointed him - god spirit with holy and with power,
71582 ^ who went about
71584 ^ doing good
71585 ^ and healing
71587 ^ all those being oppressed by the devil,
71593 ^ because - god was with him.
71599 ^ and we [are] witnesses of all things
71603 ^ that he did in both the region of the jews and in jerusalem,
71614 ^ whom also they put to death,
71617 ^ having hanged [him] on a tree.
71620 ^ this one - god raised up on the third day,
71628 ^ and gave him
71631 ^ manifest to become,
71633 ^ not to all the people,
71637 ^ but to [the] witnesses
71639 ^ - having been chosen beforehand by - god, to us
71645 ^ who did eat with
71647 ^ and drink with him
71650 ^ after - rising his out from [the] dead.
71656 ^ and he instructed us
71659 ^ to proclaim to the people
71662 ^ and to testify fully
71664 ^ that he is
71667 ^ the [one] having been appointed by - god [as] judge
71673 ^ of living and dead.
71676 ^ to him all the prophets bear witness
71681 ^ [that] forgiveness of sins receives through the name of him
71688 ^ everyone - believing in him.
71693 ^ still speaking - of peter the words these,
71700 ^ fell the spirit - holy
71705 ^ upon all those hearing the word.
71711 ^ and were amazed the from [the] circumcision believers,
71717 ^ as many as had come with - peter,
71721 ^ that even upon the gentiles the gift of the holy spirit has been poured out.
71732 ^ they were hearing for them
71735 ^ speaking in tongues
71737 ^ and magnifying - god.
71741 ^ then answered peter,
71744 ^ if not
71745 ^ the water is able to withhold anyone
71750 ^ - not
71752 ^ to baptize these
71754 ^ who the spirit - holy have received,
71760 ^ just as also [have] we?
71763 ^ he commanded now them
71766 ^ in the name of jesus christ to be baptized.
71772 ^ then they asked him
71775 ^ to remain days some.
71778 ^ heard now the apostles and the brothers
71785 ^ - being in - judea
71790 ^ that also the gentiles had received the word - of god.
71799 ^ when also went up peter to jerusalem,
71805 ^ began contending with him those of [the] circumcision,
71811 ^ saying
71812 ^ -, you went to men
71816 ^ uncircumcision having,
71818 ^ and ate with them.
71821 ^ having begun now peter, he set [it] forth to them in order,
71827 ^ saying,
71828 ^ i was
71830 ^ in [the] city of joppa praying,
71834 ^ and i saw in a trance a vision,
71839 ^ descending a vessel certain
71842 ^ like a sheet great,
71845 ^ by four corners being let down out of - heaven,
71851 ^ and it came down as far as me.
71855 ^ on it having looked intently, i was observing [it],
71859 ^ and i saw the quadrupeds of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the birds of the air.
71876 ^ i heard then also a voice
71880 ^ saying to me,
71882 ^ having risen up, peter, kill
71885 ^ and eat.
71887 ^ i said however,
71889 ^ in no way, lord,
71891 ^ for common or unclean nothing ever has entered into the mouth of me.
71901 ^ answered however the voice for a second [time] out of - heaven,
71909 ^ what - god has cleansed, you not do call unholy.
71916 ^ this now happened on three times,
71921 ^ and was drawn up again all into - heaven.
71928 ^ and behold,
71930 ^ immediately three men stood at the house
71937 ^ in which i was,
71940 ^ having been sent from caesarea to me.
71945 ^ told now the spirit me
71950 ^ to go with them,
71952 ^ not having discriminated.
71954 ^ went now with me also - six brothers these,
71963 ^ and we entered into the house of the man.
71970 ^ he related then to us
71973 ^ how he had seen the angel
71977 ^ in the house of him, having stood
71982 ^ and having said,
71984 ^ send forth to joppa,
71987 ^ and send for simon,
71990 ^ who is called peter,
71993 ^ who will speak words to you,
71998 ^ in which will be saved you
72002 ^ and all the household of you.
72007 ^ in then - beginning my
72012 ^ to speak, fell the spirit - holy upon them,
72020 ^ even as also upon us in [the] beginning.
72026 ^ i remembered then the word of the lord,
72032 ^ how he had said,
72034 ^ john indeed baptized with water;
72038 ^ you however will be baptized with [the] spirit holy.
72044 ^ if then the same gift has given to them - god
72053 ^ as also to us
72056 ^ having believed on the lord jesus christ,
72062 ^ i how
72064 ^ was able
72066 ^ to forbid - god?
72069 ^ having heard then these things, they were silent
72073 ^ and glorified - god,
72077 ^ saying,
72078 ^ then indeed also to the gentiles - god - repentance unto life has given.
72089 ^ those indeed therefore having been scattered by the tribulation
72096 ^ - having taken place over stephen, passed through to phoenicia, and cyprus, and antioch,
72107 ^ to no one speaking the word
72111 ^ if not only to jews.
72115 ^ were however some of them, men of cyprus and of cyrene,
72124 ^ who
72125 ^ having come into antioch, were speaking also to the hellenists,
72133 ^ proclaiming the gospel — the lord jesus.
72137 ^ and was [the] hand of [the] lord with them;
72143 ^ [a] great then
72145 ^ number
72146 ^ - having believed, turned to the lord.
72152 ^ was heard now the report in the ears of the church
72161 ^ - being in jerusalem
72165 ^ concerning them,
72167 ^ and they sent forth barnabas
72170 ^ to go as far as antioch,
72173 ^ who
72174 ^ having come
72175 ^ and having seen the grace of - god, rejoiced
72183 ^ and was exhorting all
72186 ^ with resolute purpose - of heart to abide in the lord.
72193 ^ for he was a man good, and full of [the] spirit holy, and of faith.
72203 ^ and was added a crowd large to the lord.
72209 ^ he went forth then to tarsus
72213 ^ to seek saul,
72215 ^ and
72216 ^ having found [him], he brought [him] to antioch.
72220 ^ it came to pass [that] now they
72223 ^ also a year whole gathered together in the church
72230 ^ and taught a crowd large.
72234 ^ were called then first in antioch the disciples, christians.
72242 ^ in these now
72245 ^ - days came down from jerusalem prophets to antioch.
72253 ^ having risen up now one of them named agabus, he signified by the spirit [that]
72264 ^ a famine great is about
72267 ^ to be over all the world —
72272 ^ which came to pass under claudius.
72276 ^ - and
72278 ^ the disciples,
72279 ^ as was prospered anyone,
72282 ^ determined each of them,
72285 ^ for ministry, to send to the
72289 ^ dwelling in - judea brothers,
72294 ^ which also they did,
72297 ^ having sent [it] to the elders by [the] hand of barnabas and saul.
72306 ^ at that now
72309 ^ - time, put forth herod the king the hands
72317 ^ to mistreat some of those of the church.
72323 ^ he put to death then james, the brother of john, with the sword.
72330 ^ having seen now
72332 ^ that pleasing it is
72335 ^ to the jews, he proceeded
72338 ^ to take also peter —
72341 ^ these were now the days of the unleavened [bread] —
72347 ^ whom also having seized, he put in prison,
72353 ^ having delivered [him] to four sets of four soldiers
72357 ^ to guard him,
72359 ^ intending
72360 ^ after the passover to bring out him to the people.
72367 ^ - indeed therefore
72370 ^ peter was kept in the prison;
72375 ^ prayer however was
72378 ^ fervent being made by the church to - god concerning him.
72388 ^ when then was about
72391 ^ to bring forth him - herod,
72395 ^ the night that, was - peter
72401 ^ sleeping between two soldiers,
72405 ^ having been bound with chains two,
72408 ^ guards also before the door were watching the prison.
72416 ^ and behold,
72418 ^ an angel of [the] lord stood by,
72421 ^ and a light shone in the cell.
72427 ^ having struck then the side - of peter, he woke up him,
72435 ^ saying,
72436 ^ rise up in haste.
72439 ^ and fell of him the chains off the hands.
72447 ^ said then the angel to him,
72453 ^ gird yourself about
72454 ^ and put on the sandals of you.
72459 ^ he did and so.
72462 ^ and he says to him,
72465 ^ wrap around [you] the cloak of you
72469 ^ and follow me.
72472 ^ and
72473 ^ having gone forth, he was following
72475 ^ and not did know
72478 ^ that real is
72481 ^ what is happening by means of the angel;
72486 ^ he was thinking however
72488 ^ a vision he saw.
72490 ^ having passed through then a first guard and a second, they came to the gate - iron
72502 ^ - leading into the city,
72507 ^ which by itself opened to them.
72511 ^ and
72512 ^ having gone out they went on through street one,
72516 ^ and immediately departed the angel from him.
72523 ^ and - peter
72526 ^ to himself having come, said,
72530 ^ now i know truly
72533 ^ that has sent forth the lord the angel of him
72540 ^ and delivered me out of [the] hand of herod and all the expectation of the people of the jews.
72554 ^ having considered [it] also, he came to the house of mary the mother of john,
72565 ^ who is called mark,
72568 ^ where were many
72571 ^ having gathered together
72572 ^ and praying.
72574 ^ having knocked then of him [at] the door of the gate,
72581 ^ came a girl
72583 ^ to answer,
72584 ^ named rhoda.
72586 ^ and
72587 ^ having recognized the voice - of peter, from - joy not she opened the gate,
72599 ^ having run in; but she reported
72602 ^ to be standing - peter before the gate.
72608 ^ - and to her they said,
72613 ^ you are out of your mind.
72614 ^ - but she kept insisting
72617 ^ [it] so to be.
72619 ^ - and they kept saying,
72622 ^ the angel it is
72625 ^ of him.
72626 ^ - but
72628 ^ peter continued
72630 ^ knocking;
72631 ^ having opened [it] then, they saw him
72635 ^ and were amazed.
72637 ^ having made a sign then to them with the hand
72642 ^ to be silent, he related to them
72645 ^ how the lord him had brought out of the prison.
72653 ^ he said then,
72655 ^ report to james and to the brothers these things.
72661 ^ and
72662 ^ having gone out, he went to another place.
72667 ^ having come now day,
72670 ^ there was disturbance no small among the soldiers,
72677 ^ what then [of] - peter has become.
72682 ^ herod then
72684 ^ having sought after him,
72686 ^ and not having found [him],
72689 ^ having examined the guards, he commanded [them]
72693 ^ to be led away [to death].
72694 ^ and
72695 ^ having gone down from - judea to caesarea, he stayed [there].
72702 ^ he had been now
72704 ^ furiously angry with [the] tyrians and sidonians;
72708 ^ with one accord then they came to him.
72713 ^ and
72714 ^ having gained blastus, who [was] over the bedchamber of the king, they were seeking peace,
72724 ^ because of - being nourished their - region by the king’s.
72733 ^ on the appointed now
72735 ^ day, - herod,
72738 ^ having put on apparel royal
72741 ^ and having sat on the throne, was making an address to them.
72749 ^ - and
72751 ^ the people were crying out,
72753 ^ of a god [this is the] voice,
72755 ^ and not of a man!
72758 ^ immediately then struck him an angel of [the] lord,
72764 ^ in return for that not he gave the glory - to god;
72772 ^ and
72773 ^ having been eaten by worms, he breathed his last.
72776 ^ - but
72778 ^ the word - of god continued to grow
72782 ^ and to multiply.
72784 ^ barnabas then
72786 ^ and saul returned, to jerusalem
72791 ^ having fulfilled the mission,
72794 ^ having taken with [them] john,
72796 ^ the [one] having been called mark.
72799 ^ there were now in antioch, in the
72805 ^ being [there] church, prophets and teachers, - both barnabas and simeon
72815 ^ who was called niger, and lucius the cyrenian, manaen also — herod the tetrarch brought up with — and saul.
72830 ^ as were ministering now they to the lord
72835 ^ and fasting,
72837 ^ said the spirit - holy,
72842 ^ set apart then to me - barnabas and saul for the work
72852 ^ to which i have called them.
72855 ^ then
72856 ^ having fasted,
72857 ^ and having prayed,
72859 ^ and having laid the hands on them, they sent [them] off.
72865 ^ they indeed therefore
72868 ^ having been sent forth by the holy spirit, went down to seleucia.
72876 ^ from there then they sailed to cyprus.
72881 ^ and
72882 ^ having come into salamis, they began proclaiming the word - of god in the synagogues of the jews.
72895 ^ they had now also john [as] a helper.
72900 ^ having passed through now all the island, as far as paphos, they found a man — a certain magician, a false prophet jewish —
72913 ^ whose name [was] bar-jesus,
72916 ^ who was with the proconsul sergius paulus, man an intelligent.
72925 ^ he
72926 ^ having called to [him] barnabas and saul, desired
72931 ^ to hear the word - of god.
72936 ^ was opposing however them elymas the magician —
72942 ^ thus for means the name of him —
72948 ^ seeking
72949 ^ to turn away the proconsul from the faith.
72955 ^ saul then,
72957 ^ - also [called] paul,
72960 ^ having been filled [the] spirit holy,
72963 ^ having looked intently upon him, said,
72967 ^ o full of all deceit and all craft, son of [the] devil, enemy of all righteousness, not will you cease
72981 ^ perverting the ways the of lord - straight?
72988 ^ and now behold,
72991 ^ [the] hand of the lord [is] upon you,
72995 ^ and you will be blind,
72998 ^ not seeing the sun during a season.
73004 ^ immediately then fell upon him mist and darkness,
73012 ^ and
73013 ^ going about he was seeking someone to lead [him] by the hand.
73016 ^ then
73017 ^ having seen the proconsul
73020 ^ that having happened, he believed,
73023 ^ being astonished at the teaching of the lord.
73029 ^ having sailed then from - paphos [with] those around [him], paul came to perga - of pamphylia.
73042 ^ john however
73044 ^ having departed from them, returned to jerusalem.
73050 ^ they now,
73052 ^ having passed through from - perga, came to antioch - of pisidia,
73061 ^ and
73062 ^ having gone into the synagogue on the day of the sabbaths, they sat down.
73071 ^ after then
73073 ^ the reading of the law and of the prophets, sent the rulers of the synagogue to them,
73085 ^ saying,
73086 ^ men, brothers, if any there is among you
73093 ^ a word of exhortation toward the people,
73098 ^ speak.
73099 ^ having risen up then paul,
73102 ^ and having made a sign with the hand, he said,
73107 ^ men, israelites,
73109 ^ and those fearing - god, listen.
73115 ^ the god of the people this of israel chose the fathers of us,
73125 ^ and the people exalted in the sojourn in [the] land of egypt,
73135 ^ and with arm uplifted, brought them out of it,
73143 ^ and of about forty years for a period he endured the ways their in the wilderness,
73152 ^ and
73153 ^ having destroyed nations seven in [the] land of canaan, he gave as an inheritance the land of them — during years four hundred and fifty.
73168 ^ and after these things, he gave [them] judges until samuel the prophet.
73177 ^ then they asked for a king,
73180 ^ and gave to them - god, - saul son of kish, a man of [the] tribe of benjamin, years forty.
73195 ^ and
73196 ^ having removed him, he raised up - david to them as king,
73204 ^ to whom also he said,
73207 ^ having carried witness:
73208 ^ i have found david the [son] of jesse a man according to the heart of me,
73218 ^ who will do all the will of me.
73224 ^ of this [man] - god,
73227 ^ of the seed, according to promise, has brought - to israel [the] savior jesus —
73237 ^ having proclaimed john before [the] face of the coming of him a baptism of repentance to all the people of israel.
73250 ^ while then was fulfilling john the course,
73256 ^ he was saying,
73257 ^ whom me do you suppose to be?
73261 ^ not am i [he],
73264 ^ but behold,
73266 ^ he comes after me,
73269 ^ of whom not i am
73272 ^ worthy
73273 ^ a sandal of the feet to untie.
73278 ^ men, brothers, sons of [the] family of abraham, and those among you
73287 ^ fearing - god, to us the message of the salvation this has been sent.
73297 ^ those for
73299 ^ dwelling in jerusalem and the rulers of them,
73306 ^ him not having known,
73308 ^ and the voices of the prophets
73313 ^ that on every sabbath
73317 ^ are being read,
73318 ^ having condemned [him] they fulfilled [them].
73320 ^ and
73321 ^ no cause of death having found, they begged pilate
73327 ^ to put to death him.
73329 ^ when then they had finished
73332 ^ all the things about him
73336 ^ having been written,
73337 ^ having taken [him] down from the tree, they put [him] in a tomb.
73344 ^ - but
73346 ^ god raised him out from [the] dead,
73351 ^ who appeared for days many
73356 ^ to those having come up with him from - galilee to jerusalem,
73364 ^ who now are witnesses of him to the people.
73372 ^ and we to you preach the gospel, the to the fathers promise
73381 ^ having been made,
73382 ^ that this - god has fulfilled, to the children of them, to us,
73391 ^ having raised up jesus,
73393 ^ as also in the psalm it has been written,
73399 ^ the second:
73401 ^ son of me are you,
73405 ^ i today have begotten you.’
73409 ^ that then he raised him out from [the] dead,
73415 ^ no more being about
73417 ^ to return to decay,
73420 ^ thus he spoke
73422 ^ -: i will give to you the holy [blessings] of david, the sure [blessings].’
73430 ^ therefore also in another he says:
73435 ^ not you will allow the holy one of you
73440 ^ to see decay.’
73442 ^ david indeed for
73445 ^ in his own generation having served the - of god purpose, fell asleep
73453 ^ and was added to the fathers of him,
73459 ^ and saw decay.
73462 ^ the [one] however - god raised up not did see decay.
73470 ^ known therefore be it
73473 ^ to you, men, brothers,
73476 ^ that through this one, to you forgiveness of sins is proclaimed.
73483 ^ and from all things
73486 ^ from which not you were able
73489 ^ in [the] law of moses to be justified,
73493 ^ in him
73495 ^ everyone - believing is justified.
73499 ^ take heed therefore,
73501 ^ lest might come about
73503 ^ that having been said in the prophets:
73508 ^ behold, - scoffers,
73511 ^ and wonder
73513 ^ and perish;
73515 ^ for a work am working i in the days of you,
73523 ^ a work
73524 ^ that never not you would believe,
73528 ^ even if one should declare it to you.’
73532 ^ having departed then, they
73535 ^ were begging
73536 ^ on the next sabbath to be spoken to them the words these.
73545 ^ having broken up then the synagogue,
73549 ^ followed many of the jews and of the
73555 ^ worshipping converts - paul and - barnabas,
73562 ^ who
73563 ^ speaking to them kept persuading them
73567 ^ to continue in the grace - of god.
73572 ^ on the now
73574 ^ coming sabbath, almost all the city was gathered together
73581 ^ to hear the word - of the lord.
73586 ^ having seen however the jews the crowds, they were filled with jealousy
73594 ^ and began contradicting
73596 ^ the things by paul
73599 ^ spoken,
73600 ^ blaspheming.
73601 ^ having spoken boldly also, - paul and - barnabas said,
73609 ^ to you it was necessary first to be spoken the word - of god;
73618 ^ but since you thrust away it
73621 ^ and not worthy you judge yourselves
73626 ^ - of eternal life,
73629 ^ behold,
73630 ^ we are turning to the gentiles.
73634 ^ thus for has commanded us the lord:
73640 ^ i have set you for a light of [the] gentiles,
73645 ^ - to be you for salvation to [the] uttermost part of the earth.’
73654 ^ hearing [it] then, the gentiles were rejoicing
73659 ^ and glorifying the word of the lord,
73665 ^ and believed
73667 ^ as many as were
73669 ^ appointed to life eternal.
73673 ^ was carried then the word of the lord through all the region.
73683 ^ the but
73685 ^ jews incited the
73688 ^ worshipping women - of honorable position, and the principals of the city,
73697 ^ and they stirred up a persecution against - paul and barnabas,
73705 ^ and expelled them from the district of them.
73712 ^ - but
73714 ^ having shaken off the dust of the feet against them, they went to iconium;
73724 ^ - and
73726 ^ the disciples were filled with joy and [the] spirit holy.
73732 ^ it came to pass now
73734 ^ in iconium, according to the same entered they into the synagogue of the jews
73746 ^ and spoke so
73749 ^ that believed of jewish both and greeks a great number.
73757 ^ the however
73759 ^ unbelieving jews stirred up
73762 ^ and poisoned the minds of the gentiles against the brothers.
73771 ^ a long indeed therefore
73774 ^ time they stayed,
73776 ^ speaking boldly for the lord,
73780 ^ the [one] bearing witness to the word of the grace of him,
73788 ^ granting
73789 ^ signs and wonders to be done through the hands of them.
73797 ^ was divided now the multitude of the city,
73803 ^ and some indeed were with the jews;
73810 ^ some however with the apostles.
73815 ^ when then there was a rush of the gentiles both and jews, with the rulers of them,
73828 ^ to mistreat
73829 ^ and to stone them,
73832 ^ having become aware, they fled to the cities - of lycaonia, lystra, and derbe, and the surrounding region,
73845 ^ and there
73846 ^ preaching the gospel they continued.
73848 ^ and a certain man crippled, in lystra,
73854 ^ in the feet, was sitting,
73857 ^ lame from [the] womb of [the] mother of him,
73862 ^ who never had walked.
73865 ^ this [man] heard - paul
73869 ^ speaking,
73870 ^ who,
73871 ^ having looked intently at him
73873 ^ and having seen
73875 ^ that he has faith
73878 ^ - to be healed, said in a loud voice,
73883 ^ stand on the feet of you upright!
73889 ^ and he sprang up
73891 ^ and began to walk.
73893 ^ - and
73895 ^ the crowds
73896 ^ having seen
73897 ^ what had done paul, lifted up the voice of them
73904 ^ in lycaonian, saying,
73906 ^ the gods,
73908 ^ having become like men, have come down to us.
73913 ^ they began calling then - barnabas zeus,
73918 ^ - and
73920 ^ paul hermes,
73922 ^ because he was
73925 ^ the leading - speaker.
73929 ^ - and
73931 ^ the priest - of zeus,
73934 ^ - being just outside the city,
73939 ^ oxen and wreaths to the gates having brought,
73946 ^ with the crowds was desiring to sacrifice.
73951 ^ having heard however, the apostles barnabas and paul,
73958 ^ having torn the garments of them, rushed out into the crowd,
73966 ^ crying out
73967 ^ and saying,
73969 ^ men, why these things do you?
73973 ^ also we
73975 ^ of like nature are
73977 ^ with you men,
73979 ^ proclaiming the gospel to you,
73981 ^ from these - vanities to turn to god
73988 ^ [the] living,
73989 ^ who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them,
74004 ^ who in the
74007 ^ past generations allowed all the nations
74013 ^ to go the ways of them.
74017 ^ and yet not without witness himself he has left,
74022 ^ doing good, from heaven to you
74025 ^ rains giving
74027 ^ and seasons fruitful,
74030 ^ filling with food and gladness the hearts of you.
74037 ^ and
74038 ^ these things saying, hardly they stopped the crowds
74044 ^ - not
74046 ^ sacrificing to them.
74048 ^ came however from antioch and iconium jews,
74055 ^ and
74056 ^ having persuaded the crowds,
74059 ^ and having stoned - paul, they dragged [him] outside the city,
74067 ^ supposing
74068 ^ him to have died.
74070 ^ having surrounded however the disciples him,
74075 ^ having risen up, he entered into the city.
74080 ^ and on the next day he went away with - barnabas to derbe.
74089 ^ having proclaimed the gospel to then
74091 ^ the city that,
74094 ^ and having discipled many, they returned to - lystra, and to iconium, and to antioch,
74107 ^ strengthening the souls of the disciples,
74112 ^ exhorting [them]
74113 ^ to continue in the faith,
74116 ^ and that
74118 ^ through many tribulations it behooves us to enter into the kingdom - of god.
74129 ^ having chosen now for them in every church elders,
74135 ^ having prayed, with fasting they committed them to the lord,
74142 ^ in whom they had believed.
74145 ^ and
74146 ^ having passed through - pisidia, they came to - pamphylia,
74153 ^ and
74154 ^ having spoken in perga the word, they went down to attalia.
74162 ^ and from there they sailed to antioch,
74166 ^ from where they had
74168 ^ been committed to the grace - of god for the work
74176 ^ that they had fulfilled.
74178 ^ having arrived now
74180 ^ and having gathered together the church, they began declaring
74185 ^ all that had done - god with them,
74191 ^ and that he had opened to the gentiles a door of faith.
74198 ^ they remained then time no little with the disciples.
74206 ^ and certain ones
74208 ^ having come down from - judea were teaching the brothers
74215 ^ -, if not you are circumcised according to the custom - of moses,
74223 ^ not you are able
74225 ^ to be saved.
74226 ^ having been brought about then commotion and discussion no small - by paul and - barnabas with them,
74240 ^ they appointed
74241 ^ to go up paul and barnabas and certain others out from them, to the apostles and elders, to jerusalem, about the question this.
74261 ^ they indeed therefore
74264 ^ having been sent forward by the church were passing through - both phoenicia and samaria,
74274 ^ relating in detail the conversion of the gentiles,
74279 ^ and they were bringing joy great to all the brothers.
74286 ^ having come then to jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders.
74300 ^ they declared then
74302 ^ all that - god had done with them.
74308 ^ rose up now certain of those of the sect of the pharisees
74317 ^ who believed,
74318 ^ saying
74319 ^ -, it is necessary
74321 ^ to circumcise them,
74323 ^ to command [them] then
74325 ^ to keep the law of moses.
74329 ^ were gathered together then the apostles and the elders
74336 ^ to see about the matter this.
74341 ^ of much now
74343 ^ discussion having taken place,
74345 ^ having risen up, peter said to them,
74350 ^ men, brothers, you know
74354 ^ that from days early, among you chose - god
74363 ^ by the mouth of me to hear the gentiles the word of the gospel,
74374 ^ and to believe.
74376 ^ and the heart-knowing god bore witness to them,
74382 ^ having given [them] the spirit - holy,
74387 ^ as also to us,
74390 ^ and not one he made distinction between us also and them,
74398 ^ by the faith having purified the hearts of them.
74404 ^ now therefore, why are you testing - god,
74410 ^ to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples
74417 ^ that neither the fathers of us, nor we, have been able
74425 ^ to bear?
74426 ^ but by the grace of [the] lord jesus, we believe
74434 ^ to be saved,
74435 ^ in [the] same manner [as] they also.
74439 ^ kept silent now all the multitude,
74444 ^ and were listening to barnabas and paul
74449 ^ relating
74450 ^ what had done - god,
74454 ^ signs and wonders, among the gentiles by them.
74462 ^ after now - were silent they, answered james,
74469 ^ saying,
74470 ^ men, brothers, hear me.
74474 ^ simeon has related
74476 ^ how first - god visited,
74481 ^ to take out of [the] gentiles a people for the name of him.
74488 ^ and with this agree the words of the prophets,
74495 ^ as it is written:
74497 ^ after these things i will return
74500 ^ and will rebuild the tabernacle of david
74505 ^ which has fallen,
74507 ^ and
74508 ^ the ruins of it i will rebuild,
74512 ^ and i will set upright it,
74515 ^ so that - may seek out the remnant - of men the lord,
74524 ^ and all the gentiles,
74528 ^ upon whom has been called the name of me upon them,
74536 ^ says [the] lord,
74538 ^ doing these things, known from eternity.’
74543 ^ therefore i judge
74546 ^ not to trouble
74548 ^ those who, from the gentiles,
74552 ^ are turning to - god,
74556 ^ but to write to them
74559 ^ - to abstain from the pollutions of the idols, and - sexual immorality, and that which is strangled, and from blood.
74574 ^ moses for from generations of old, in every city
74581 ^ [ones] proclaiming him has,
74585 ^ in the synagogues on every sabbath being read.
74592 ^ then it seemed good to the apostles and to the elders, with all the church,
74603 ^ having chosen men out from them, to send to antioch with - paul and barnabas:
74615 ^ judas
74616 ^ - called barsabbas, and silas, men
74622 ^ leading among the brothers,
74626 ^ having written by [the] hand of them:
74630 ^ the apostles and the elders, brothers, to those in - antioch and syria and cilicia, brothers - among the gentiles:
74648 ^ greetings.
74649 ^ inasmuch as we have heard
74651 ^ that some
74653 ^ from us went out troubled you by words,
74659 ^ upsetting the minds of you,
74663 ^ to whom not we had given instructions,
74666 ^ it seemed good to us
74668 ^ having come with one accord,
74670 ^ having chosen men, to send to you, with the beloved of us, barnabas and paul, men
74683 ^ having handed over the lives of them for the name of the lord of us, jesus christ.
74695 ^ we have sent therefore judas and silas,
74700 ^ and they
74702 ^ by word [of mouth] are telling [you] the same things.
74707 ^ it seemed good for to the spirit - holy and to us,
74715 ^ no further to lay upon you
74719 ^ burden, except these - necessary things:
74724 ^ to abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from sexual immorality.
74732 ^ from these keeping yourselves, well you will do.
74738 ^ farewell.
74739 ^ they indeed therefore,
74742 ^ having been sent off, went to antioch,
74746 ^ and
74747 ^ having gathered the multitude, they delivered the letter.
74753 ^ having read [it] now, they rejoiced at the encouragement.
74759 ^ judas both and silas,
74763 ^ also themselves prophets being, by talk much exhorted the brothers
74773 ^ and strengthened [them].
74775 ^ having continued then a time, they were sent away in peace from the brothers
74784 ^ to those having sent them.
74788 ^ paul however
74790 ^ and barnabas stayed in antioch,
74795 ^ teaching
74796 ^ and proclaiming the good news, with also others many, the word of the lord.
74806 ^ after now
74808 ^ some days, said to barnabas, paul,
74814 ^ having turned back indeed let us look after the brothers in city every
74822 ^ in which we have announced the word of the lord,
74829 ^ how they are.
74831 ^ barnabas now purposed
74834 ^ to take along also - john
74838 ^ - called mark;
74841 ^ paul however thought fit,
74844 ^ the [one] having withdrawn from them from pamphylia
74850 ^ and not having gone with them to the work,
74857 ^ not to take along him.
74860 ^ arose therefore a sharp disagreement,
74863 ^ so that separated they from one another;
74868 ^ - and
74870 ^ barnabas,
74871 ^ having taken - mark, sailed to cyprus.
74877 ^ paul however,
74879 ^ having chosen silas, went forth,
74882 ^ having been committed to the grace of the lord by the brothers.
74890 ^ he was passing through then - syria and - cilicia,
74897 ^ strengthening the churches.
74900 ^ he came then also to derbe and to lystra.
74908 ^ and behold,
74910 ^ a disciple certain was there,
74914 ^ named timothy, [the] son of a woman jewish believing,
74920 ^ father however a greek,
74923 ^ who was well spoken of by the in lystra and iconium brothers.
74932 ^ this one wanted - paul with him to go forth,
74939 ^ and
74940 ^ having taken, he circumcised him on account of the jews
74946 ^ - being in the parts those;
74952 ^ they knew for all
74955 ^ that a greek the father of him was.
74961 ^ while then they were passing through the cities,
74966 ^ they were delivering to them
74968 ^ to keep the decrees
74971 ^ - decided on by the apostles and elders who [were] in jerusalem.
74981 ^ the indeed therefore
74984 ^ churches were strengthened in the faith,
74988 ^ and were increasing - in number every day.
74994 ^ having passed through then - phrygia and the galatian region,
75001 ^ having been forbidden by the holy spirit
75006 ^ to speak the word in - asia,
75012 ^ having come then down to - mysia, they were attempting
75018 ^ into - bithynia to go;
75022 ^ and not did allow them the spirit of jesus;
75029 ^ having passed by then - mysia, they came down to troas.
75036 ^ and a vision during the night - to paul appeared:
75044 ^ a man of macedonia certain was
75048 ^ standing
75049 ^ and beseeching him
75052 ^ and saying,
75054 ^ having passed over into macedonia, help us.
75059 ^ when now the vision he had seen,
75064 ^ immediately we sought
75066 ^ to go forth to macedonia,
75069 ^ concluding
75070 ^ that had called us - god
75075 ^ to preach the gospel to them.
75077 ^ having sailed then from troas, we made a straight course to samothrace,
75084 ^ - and the following day, to nea polis,
75090 ^ and from there to philippi,
75093 ^ which is [the] leading district of the of macedonia city, a colony.
75101 ^ we were now
75103 ^ in this - city staying days some.
75110 ^ on the then
75112 ^ day of the sabbaths, we went forth outside the city gate, by a river,
75121 ^ where was customary [a place of] prayer to be.
75125 ^ and
75126 ^ having sat down, we began speaking to the
75129 ^ having gathered women.
75131 ^ and a certain woman named lydia, a seller of purple of [the] city of thyatira,
75139 ^ worshiping - god, was listening,
75143 ^ of whom the lord opened
75147 ^ the heart
75149 ^ to attend
75150 ^ to the things being spoken by - paul.
75155 ^ when then she was baptized,
75158 ^ and the house of her,
75162 ^ she begged,
75163 ^ saying,
75164 ^ if you have judged me
75167 ^ faithful to the lord to be,
75171 ^ having entered into the house of me, abide.
75177 ^ and she persuaded us.
75180 ^ it happened now,
75182 ^ going of us to the [place of] prayer,
75187 ^ a girl certain,
75189 ^ having a spirit of python, met us,
75194 ^ who gain much was bringing the masters of her
75201 ^ by fortune-telling.
75202 ^ she,
75203 ^ having followed - paul and us, was crying out,
75209 ^ saying,
75210 ^ these - men servants of the god - most high are,
75219 ^ who proclaim to you [the] way of salvation.
75224 ^ this then she continued for many days.
75230 ^ having been distressed then paul,
75233 ^ and having turned to the spirit, he said,
75238 ^ i command you in [the] name of jesus christ
75244 ^ to come out from her.
75247 ^ and it came out [the] same - hour.
75252 ^ having seen now the masters of her
75257 ^ that was gone the hope of the profit of them,
75264 ^ having taken hold of - paul and - silas, they dragged [them] into the marketplace before the rulers;
75277 ^ and
75278 ^ having brought up them to the magistrates, they said,
75283 ^ these - men exceedingly trouble of us the city,
75290 ^ jews being,
75292 ^ and preach customs,
75295 ^ that not it is lawful for us
75299 ^ to accept
75300 ^ nor
75301 ^ to practice,
75302 ^ romans being.
75304 ^ and rose up together the crowd against them,
75310 ^ and the magistrates
75313 ^ having torn off of them the garments, were commanding that
75318 ^ they be beaten with rods.
75319 ^ many then having laid on them blows, they cast [them] into prison,
75327 ^ having charged the jailer
75330 ^ securely to keep them,
75333 ^ who
75334 ^ an order such having received, threw them into the inner prison,
75343 ^ and the feet fastened
75347 ^ of them in the stocks.
75351 ^ toward now
75353 ^ - midnight, paul and silas,
75358 ^ praying, were singing praises to - god.
75362 ^ were listening now to them the prisoners.
75367 ^ suddenly then earthquake there was
75371 ^ a great,
75372 ^ so that were shaken the foundations of the prison house;
75378 ^ were opened then immediately the doors all,
75384 ^ and of all, the chains were loosed.
75389 ^ awoken then
75391 ^ having been the jailer,
75394 ^ and having seen
75396 ^ open the doors of the prison,
75401 ^ having drawn his sword, he was about
75405 ^ himself to kill,
75407 ^ supposing
75408 ^ to have escaped the prisoners.
75411 ^ called out however
75413 ^ loud
75414 ^ in a voice,
75415 ^ -
75416 ^ paul
75417 ^ saying,
75418 ^ not do to yourself
75421 ^ harm;
75422 ^ all for we are here.
75426 ^ having called for now lights, he rushed in,
75430 ^ and
75431 ^ terrified having become, he fell down before - paul and - silas.
75439 ^ and
75440 ^ having brought them out he was saying,
75444 ^ sirs,
75445 ^ what of me is necessary to do,
75449 ^ that i may be saved?
75451 ^ - and they said,
75454 ^ believe on the lord jesus,
75459 ^ and you will be saved, you
75462 ^ and the household of you.
75466 ^ and they spoke to him the word of the lord, along with all those in the house of him.
75480 ^ and
75481 ^ having taken them in that - hour of the night, he washed [them] from the wounds;
75493 ^ and he was baptized, he
75496 ^ and the [household] of him all immediately.
75501 ^ having brought then them into the house, he laid a table [for them],
75509 ^ and rejoiced with all [his] household,
75512 ^ having believed - in god.
75515 ^ day then having come,
75518 ^ sent the magistrates the officers,
75523 ^ saying,
75524 ^ release the men those.
75528 ^ reported then the jailer the words these to - paul
75538 ^ -: have sent the captains,
75542 ^ that you may be let go.
75544 ^ now therefore
75546 ^ having gone out, depart in peace.
75550 ^ - but
75552 ^ paul was saying to them,
75556 ^ having beaten us publicly,
75559 ^ uncondemned men,
75561 ^ romans being, they cast [us] into prison,
75566 ^ and now secretly us do they throw out?
75571 ^ no indeed!
75573 ^ instead,
75574 ^ having come themselves, us let them bring out.
75578 ^ reported then to the captains the officers the words these.
75587 ^ they were afraid then,
75589 ^ having heard
75590 ^ that romans they are.
75593 ^ and
75594 ^ having come, they appealed to them,
75597 ^ and
75598 ^ having brought [them] out, they were asking [them]
75600 ^ to go out of the city.
75604 ^ having gone forth then out of the prison, they came to - lydia;
75613 ^ and
75614 ^ having seen [them], they exhorted the brothers
75618 ^ and departed.
75620 ^ having passed through then - amphipolis and - apollonia, they came to thessalonica,
75630 ^ where was a synagogue of the jews.
75635 ^ according to now
75637 ^ the custom - with paul, he went in to them,
75644 ^ and for sabbaths three he reasoned with them from the scriptures,
75653 ^ opening
75654 ^ and setting forth
75656 ^ that
75657 ^ the christ it behooved
75660 ^ to have suffered,
75661 ^ and to have risen out from [the] dead,
75665 ^ and that this is the christ
75671 ^ - jesus,
75673 ^ whom i preach to you.
75677 ^ and some of them were obedient
75682 ^ and joined themselves - to paul and - to silas, - along with
75691 ^ worshipping greeks a multitude great, women then
75697 ^ of the leading not a few.
75701 ^ having become jealous now the jews,
75705 ^ and having taken to [them] of the market-loungers men certain wicked,
75712 ^ and having collected a crowd, they set in uproar the city;
75717 ^ and
75718 ^ having assailed the house of jason, they were seeking
75723 ^ them to bring out to the people.
75728 ^ not having found however them, they dragged jason and certain brothers before the city authorities,
75740 ^ crying out
75741 ^ -,
75742 ^ the [ones] the world
75745 ^ having upset, these
75747 ^ also here are come,
75750 ^ whom has received jason.
75753 ^ and these all, contrary to the decrees of caesar do,
75761 ^ king another proclaiming to be: jesus.
75766 ^ they stirred up then the crowd, and the city authorities,
75773 ^ hearing these things.
75775 ^ and
75776 ^ having taken - security from - jason and the rest, they let go them.
75787 ^ - and
75789 ^ the brothers immediately by night sent away - both paul and - silas to berea,
75802 ^ who
75803 ^ having arrived, into the synagogue of the jews went.
75810 ^ these now were more noble than those in thessalonica,
75817 ^ who received the word with all readiness,
75824 ^ every day examining the scriptures
75829 ^ if were these things so.
75833 ^ many indeed therefore
75836 ^ of them believed,
75839 ^ and of the grecian women - prominent and men not a few.
75849 ^ when however knew those from - thessalonica jews
75857 ^ that also in - berea was proclaimed by - paul the word - of god,
75870 ^ they came there also,
75872 ^ stirring up
75873 ^ and agitating the crowds.
75877 ^ immediately also then, - paul sent away the brothers
75885 ^ to go as to the sea;
75890 ^ remained but - both silas and - timothy there.
75899 ^ those now escorting - paul brought [him] unto athens;
75907 ^ and
75908 ^ having received a command unto - silas and - timothy
75916 ^ that as quickly as possible they should come to him, they departed.
75923 ^ in now
75925 ^ - athens, waiting for them - of paul,
75931 ^ was provoked the spirit of him in him,
75937 ^ seeing
75938 ^ utterly idolatrous to be the city.
75942 ^ he was reasoning indeed therefore in the synagogue with the jews
75950 ^ and those worshiping,
75953 ^ and in the marketplace on every day
75960 ^ with those meeting [him].
75963 ^ some then also
75966 ^ of the epicureans and stoics, philosophers, encountered him.
75973 ^ and some were saying,
75976 ^ what - may desire of the babbler this to say?
75983 ^ others however,
75985 ^ of foreign gods he seems a proclaimer to be,
75990 ^ because - jesus and the resurrection he was proclaiming the gospel of.
75997 ^ having taken hold also of him, to the ares hill they brought [him],
76005 ^ saying,
76006 ^ are we able
76007 ^ to know
76008 ^ what [is] the new this, which
76013 ^ by you is spoken, teaching?
76017 ^ strange things for
76019 ^ some you are bringing to the ears of us.
76025 ^ we resolve therefore
76027 ^ to know
76028 ^ what wish these things to be.
76032 ^ [the] athenians now
76034 ^ all, and the
76037 ^ visiting strangers, in nothing else spent their time
76043 ^ than to tell something
76046 ^ and to hear something new.
76050 ^ having stood then - paul in [the] midst of the ares hill, he was saying,
76060 ^ men, athenians, in all things as very religious you i behold.
76068 ^ passing through for
76070 ^ and beholding the objects of worship of you, i found even an altar
76078 ^ on which had been inscribed:
76081 ^ to an unknown god.
76083 ^ whom therefore
76085 ^ not knowing you worship,
76087 ^ him i proclaim to you.
76091 ^ the god
76093 ^ - having made the world and all things that [are] in it,
76102 ^ he
76103 ^ of heaven and earth being
76107 ^ lord, not in hand-made temples dwells,
76113 ^ nor by hands of men is he served,
76118 ^ as needing anything,
76120 ^ himself giving to all life and breath, and the all;
76129 ^ he made then of one, every nation of men,
76136 ^ to dwell upon all the face of the earth,
76142 ^ having determined
76143 ^ [the] appointed times and the boundaries of the habitation of them,
76151 ^ to seek - god,
76154 ^ if perhaps indeed they might palpate for him,
76159 ^ and might find him.
76161 ^ and indeed, not far from one each of us he is.
76170 ^ in him for we live
76174 ^ and move
76176 ^ and are.’
76178 ^ as also some of the among you poets have said,
76186 ^ of [him] for also
76189 ^ offspring we are.’
76191 ^ offspring therefore being - of god, not we ought
76198 ^ to consider
76199 ^ to gold, or to silver, or to stone, a graven thing, of craft and imagination of man, the divine being to be
76212 ^ like.
76213 ^ the indeed therefore times - of ignorance having overlooked - god, - now he commands - men
76227 ^ all everywhere to repent,
76230 ^ because he set a day
76233 ^ in which he is about to judge the world in righteousness, by a man
76243 ^ whom he appointed,
76245 ^ a guarantee having provided to all,
76248 ^ having raised him out from [the] dead.
76252 ^ having heard of now a resurrection of [the] dead, some indeed began to mock [him];
76259 ^ some however said,
76262 ^ we will hear you concerning this also again.
76268 ^ thus - paul went out from [the] midst of them.
76275 ^ some however
76277 ^ men,
76278 ^ having joined themselves to him, believed,
76281 ^ among whom also [were] dionysius the areopagite, and a woman named damaris, and others with them.
76295 ^ and after these things,
76297 ^ having departed from - athens, he came to corinth.
76304 ^ and
76305 ^ having found a certain jew named aquila, of pontus - a native,
76313 ^ recently having come from - italy, and priscilla wife of him,
76322 ^ because of - having commanded claudius
76326 ^ to depart all the jews out of - rome, he came to them,
76335 ^ and
76336 ^ due to of the same trade
76339 ^ being, he stayed with them
76343 ^ and worked;
76345 ^ they were for tentmakers by the trade.
76350 ^ he was reasoning now in the synagogue on every sabbath,
76358 ^ persuading both jews and greeks.
76363 ^ when now came down from - macedonia - both silas and - timothy,
76375 ^ was occupied with the word - paul,
76380 ^ earnestly testifying to the jews
76383 ^ to be the christ jesus.
76387 ^ opposing however of them
76390 ^ and reviling [him],
76392 ^ having shaken out the garments, he said to them,
76398 ^ the blood of you [be] upon the head of you;
76405 ^ clean i [am].
76407 ^ from - now on, to the gentiles i will go.
76414 ^ and
76415 ^ having departed from there he came to [the] house of a certain one named titius justus,
76424 ^ worshiping - god,
76427 ^ of whom the house was
76431 ^ adjoining the synagogue.
76434 ^ crispus now,
76436 ^ the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the lord, with all the household of him.
76446 ^ and many of the corinthians
76450 ^ hearing, believed
76452 ^ and were baptized.
76454 ^ said now the lord in [the] night through a vision - to paul,
76464 ^ not fear,
76466 ^ but continue speaking,
76468 ^ and not be silent,
76471 ^ because i am with you,
76476 ^ and no one will lay a hand on you
76480 ^ - to harm you,
76483 ^ because people there are
76486 ^ to me many in the city this.
76492 ^ he remained now a year and months six,
76498 ^ teaching among them the word - of god.
76505 ^ gallio however proconsul being
76509 ^ of achaia,
76511 ^ rose up against with one accord the jews - paul,
76517 ^ and led him to the judgment seat,
76523 ^ saying
76524 ^ -,
76525 ^ contrary to the law, persuades this [man] - men to worship - god.
76535 ^ being about now - paul
76539 ^ to open the mouth,
76542 ^ said - gallio to the jews,
76548 ^ if indeed it was unrighteousness some or crime wicked,
76556 ^ o jews, according to reason - i would have endured with you;
76563 ^ if however a question it is about a word, and names, and law - in reference to your,
76576 ^ you will see [to it] yourselves;
76578 ^ a judge i of these things not resolve
76583 ^ to be.
76584 ^ and he drove them from the judgment seat.
76590 ^ having seized then all [of them] sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, they began to beat [him] before the judgment seat.
76600 ^ and nothing about these things - to gallio it mattered.
76606 ^ - now
76608 ^ paul,
76609 ^ more having remained days many, the brothers
76615 ^ having taken leave of, sailed away to - syria —
76620 ^ and with him priscilla and aquila —
76626 ^ having shaved in cenchrea the head;
76631 ^ he had for a vow.
76634 ^ they came now to ephesus,
76638 ^ and them left there.
76641 ^ he himself then
76643 ^ having entered into the synagogue, he reasoned with the jews.
76650 ^ asking [him] now of them
76653 ^ for a longer time to remain,
76657 ^ not he did consent,
76659 ^ but
76660 ^ having taken leave
76661 ^ and having said,
76663 ^ again i will return to you,
76667 ^ - god willing, he sailed from - ephesus,
76674 ^ and
76675 ^ having landed at caesarea,
76678 ^ having gone up
76679 ^ and having greeted the church, he went down to antioch.
76686 ^ and
76687 ^ having stayed time some, he went forth,
76691 ^ passing through successively the galatian region and phrygia,
76698 ^ strengthening all the disciples.
76702 ^ a jew now
76704 ^ certain, apollos named, of alexandria - a native, a man eloquent, came to ephesus,
76715 ^ mighty being in the scriptures.
76720 ^ he was
76722 ^ instructed in the way of the lord.
76727 ^ and
76728 ^ being fervent - in spirit, he was speaking
76732 ^ and was teaching earnestly the things concerning - jesus,
76739 ^ knowing only the baptism of john.
76744 ^ he then began
76747 ^ to speak boldly in the synagogue.
76751 ^ having heard however him priscilla and aquila, they took to [them] him
76759 ^ and more accurately to him expounded the way of god.
76767 ^ resolving then he
76770 ^ to pass through into - achaia,
76774 ^ having encouraged [him], the brothers wrote to the disciples
76780 ^ to welcome him,
76782 ^ who
76783 ^ having arrived, helped greatly
76786 ^ those having believed through - grace.
76791 ^ powerfully for the jews he was refuting publicly,
76797 ^ showing by the scriptures
76801 ^ to be the christ jesus.
76805 ^ it came to pass now,
76807 ^ while - - apollos
76811 ^ was in corinth, paul
76815 ^ having passed through the upper parts to come down to ephesus,
76822 ^ and having found certain disciples,
76826 ^ he said also to them,
76830 ^ if [the] spirit holy did you receive,
76834 ^ having believed?
76835 ^ - and [they said] to him,
76839 ^ but not even
76841 ^ that [a] spirit holy there is, did we hear.
76846 ^ he said then,
76848 ^ into what then were you baptized?
76852 ^ - and they said,
76855 ^ into - john's baptism.
76859 ^ said then paul,
76862 ^ john baptized a baptism of repentance,
76866 ^ the people telling
76869 ^ in the [one] coming after him that they should believe,
76876 ^ that is, in - jesus.
76881 ^ having heard then, they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus.
76890 ^ and having laid on them - paul the hands,
76897 ^ came the spirit - holy upon them;
76904 ^ they were speaking then in tongues
76907 ^ and prophesying.
76909 ^ there were then the in all men about twelve.
76916 ^ having entered then into the synagogue, he was speaking boldly for months three,
76925 ^ reasoning
76926 ^ and persuading - concerning the kingdom - of god.
76934 ^ when however some were hardened
76938 ^ and were disbelieving,
76940 ^ speaking evil of the way before the multitude,
76946 ^ having departed from them, he took separately the disciples,
76952 ^ every day reasoning in the lecture hall of tyrannus.
76959 ^ this then continued for years two,
76965 ^ so that
76966 ^ all those inhabiting - asia heard the word of the lord,
76976 ^ jews both and greeks.
76980 ^ miracles then
76982 ^ not - being ordinary, - god was performing by the hands of paul,
76992 ^ so that even
76994 ^ to the ailing were brought from the skin of him handkerchiefs or aprons,
77005 ^ and departed from them the diseases,
77011 ^ the also
77013 ^ spirits - evil left.
77017 ^ attempted now some of also
77021 ^ of the
77022 ^ itinerant jews, exorcists,
77025 ^ to invoke
77026 ^ over those having - spirits - evil the name of the lord jesus,
77038 ^ saying,
77039 ^ i adjure you [by] jesus
77043 ^ whom paul proclaims.
77046 ^ they were now certain of sceva, a jew, a high priest, seven sons,
77054 ^ this were doing.
77056 ^ answering however, the spirit - evil said to them
77064 ^ -, -
77066 ^ jesus i know,
77068 ^ and - paul i am acquainted with;
77072 ^ you however, who are you?
77076 ^ and
77077 ^ having leapt the man on them
77082 ^ in whom was the spirit - evil,
77089 ^ having overpowered them all, he prevailed against them
77094 ^ so that naked
77096 ^ and wounded they fled out of the house that.
77103 ^ this now became known to all jews both and greeks,
77112 ^ those inhabiting - ephesus;
77116 ^ and fell fear upon all them,
77122 ^ and was being magnified the name of the lord jesus.
77129 ^ many then
77131 ^ of those having believed were coming,
77134 ^ confessing
77135 ^ and declaring the deeds of them.
77140 ^ many now
77142 ^ of those the magic arts
77145 ^ having practiced,
77146 ^ having brought the books, burned [them] before all.
77152 ^ and they counted up the prices of them
77157 ^ and found [it] of silverlings myriads five.
77162 ^ thus with might of the lord the word continued to increase
77170 ^ and prevail.
77172 ^ after now were fulfilled these things,
77176 ^ purposed - paul in the spirit,
77182 ^ having passed through - macedonia and achaia, to go to jerusalem,
77190 ^ having said
77191 ^ -,
77192 ^ after - having been my there, it behooves
77198 ^ me also rome to see.
77202 ^ having sent then into - macedonia two
77208 ^ of those ministering to him, timothy and erastus, he remained for a time in - asia.
77220 ^ arose now at the time same a disturbance not small concerning the way.
77232 ^ demetrius for
77234 ^ a certain [man] named, a silversmith,
77237 ^ making shrines silver of artemis, was bringing to the craftsmen no little business,
77247 ^ whom having brought together,
77249 ^ also the in such things workmen, he said,
77256 ^ men, you know
77258 ^ that from this - business the wealth of us is.
77267 ^ and you see
77269 ^ and hear
77271 ^ that not only in ephesus, but almost all - of asia, - paul, this
77283 ^ having persuaded [them], has turned away a great many people,
77287 ^ saying
77288 ^ that not they are gods
77292 ^ - by hands
77295 ^ being made.
77296 ^ not only but this is endangered to us, the business
77304 ^ into disrepute to come,
77307 ^ but also
77309 ^ the of the great goddess artemis temple for nothing to be reckoned,
77318 ^ to be and also
77321 ^ deposed the majesty of her,
77325 ^ whom all - asia and the world worship.
77333 ^ having heard then
77335 ^ and having become full of rage, they were crying out,
77340 ^ saying,
77341 ^ great [is] - artemis of [the] ephesians.
77345 ^ and was filled the city whole with confusion;
77351 ^ they rushed and with one accord to the theatre,
77357 ^ having dragged off gaius and aristarchus, macedonians, fellow travelers of paul.
77364 ^ of paul however intending
77367 ^ to go in to the people,
77371 ^ not would allow him the disciples.
77376 ^ some then also
77379 ^ of the asiarchs,
77381 ^ being to him friends,
77384 ^ having sent to him, were urging [him]
77388 ^ not to venture himself into the theatre.
77394 ^ others indeed therefore some thing were crying out;
77400 ^ was for the assembly
77404 ^ confused,
77405 ^ and - most not did know
77410 ^ for what cause they were assembled.
77413 ^ out of now
77415 ^ the crowd to explain himself alexander,
77419 ^ having thrust forward him the jews.
77423 ^ - and
77425 ^ alexander,
77426 ^ having motioned with the hand, was wanting
77430 ^ to make a defense to the people.
77433 ^ having recognized however
77435 ^ that a jew he is, a cry there was
77440 ^ one from all,
77443 ^ about ongoing hours two crying out,
77448 ^ great [is] - artemis of [the] ephesians.
77452 ^ having calmed then the town clerk the crowd, he says,
77459 ^ men, ephesians, what for is there
77464 ^ man
77465 ^ who not knows the of [the] ephesians city
77471 ^ temple-keeper as being
77473 ^ of the great artemis, and of that fallen from the sky?
77479 ^ undeniable therefore being these things,
77483 ^ necessary it is
77485 ^ for you
77486 ^ calm to be,
77488 ^ and nothing rash to do.
77492 ^ you brought for the men these, neither temple plunderers
77499 ^ nor blaspheming the goddess of us.
77504 ^ if indeed therefore demetrius and the with him craftsmen have against anyone a matter,
77517 ^ courts are conducted,
77519 ^ and proconsuls there are;
77522 ^ let them accuse one another.
77524 ^ if however anything beyond this you inquire,
77529 ^ in the lawful assembly it will be solved.
77534 ^ and for we are in danger of
77537 ^ being accused of insurrection in regard to - this day,
77542 ^ not one cause there existing
77545 ^ concerning which not we will be able
77549 ^ to give a reason for the commotion this.
77555 ^ and
77556 ^ these things having said, he dismissed the assembly.
77561 ^ after now - had ceased the uproar,
77567 ^ having called to [him] - paul
77570 ^ the disciples
77572 ^ and having encouraged,
77574 ^ having said farewell, he departed
77576 ^ to go to macedonia.
77579 ^ having passed through then
77581 ^ the districts those,
77584 ^ and having exhorted them with talk much, he came to - greece.
77593 ^ having continued then months three,
77597 ^ having been made a plot against him by the jews,
77603 ^ he being about
77604 ^ to sail into - syria, arose a purpose
77610 ^ - to return through macedonia.
77614 ^ was accompanied by then he sopater pyrrhus, a berean; of the thessalonians now, aristarchus and secundus; and gaius of derbe and timothy; [the] asians now, tychicus and trophimus.
77635 ^ these also
77637 ^ having gone ahead, waited for us in troas.
77642 ^ we then sailed away after the days of the unleavened bread, from philippi,
77652 ^ and we came to them at - troas within days five,
77662 ^ where we stayed days seven.
77666 ^ in then
77668 ^ the first [day] of the week, having come together we
77674 ^ to break bread,
77676 ^ - paul talked to them,
77680 ^ about
77681 ^ to depart on the next day;
77684 ^ he continued then the talk until midnight.
77690 ^ there were now lamps many in the upper room
77697 ^ where we were assembled.
77700 ^ was sitting then a certain young man named eutychus by the window,
77709 ^ overpowered by sleep deep
77712 ^ as talked - paul on longer;
77717 ^ having been overpowered by the sleep, he fell from the third story down,
77726 ^ and was picked up dead.
77729 ^ having descended however, - paul fell upon him,
77735 ^ and
77736 ^ having embraced [him], said,
77738 ^ not be alarmed,
77740 ^ the for
77742 ^ life of him in him is.
77747 ^ having gone up then,
77749 ^ and having broken the bread,
77753 ^ and having eaten,
77755 ^ for long and having talked until daybreak, so he departed.
77763 ^ they brought then the boy
77767 ^ alive,
77768 ^ and were comforted not a little.
77772 ^ we however,
77774 ^ having gone ahead to the ship, sailed to - assos,
77782 ^ there being about to take in - paul.
77787 ^ thus for having arranged, he was
77791 ^ readying himself
77793 ^ to go on foot.
77794 ^ when now he met with us at - assos,
77801 ^ having taken in him, we came to mitylene.
77806 ^ and from there having sailed away,
77808 ^ on the following [day] we arrived opposite chios;
77813 ^ - then
77815 ^ the next [day] we arrived at samos;
77819 ^ the now following [day] we came to miletus.
77825 ^ had decided for - paul
77829 ^ to sail by - ephesus,
77832 ^ so that not it might come upon to him
77836 ^ to spend time in - asia;
77840 ^ he was hastened for,
77842 ^ if possible it was
77845 ^ for him,
77846 ^ on the day - of pentecost to be in jerusalem.
77853 ^ from then
77855 ^ - miletus,
77857 ^ having sent to ephesus, he called for the elders of the church.
77865 ^ when then they had come to him,
77870 ^ he said to them,
77872 ^ you know
77874 ^ from the first day
77877 ^ on which i arrived in - asia,
77883 ^ how with you the whole time i was,
77890 ^ serving the lord with all humility, and tears, and trials
77900 ^ - having befallen me in the plots of the jews;
77908 ^ how nothing i did shrink back
77911 ^ of that being profitable,
77913 ^ - not
77915 ^ to declare to you,
77917 ^ and to teach you publicly and from house to house,
77924 ^ earnestly testifying to the jewish both and to greeks, - in god repentance and faith in the lord of us, jesus.
77940 ^ and now, behold,
77943 ^ bound i in the spirit go to jerusalem,
77950 ^ what in it
77953 ^ will happen to me not knowing,
77957 ^ except that the spirit - holy in every city fully testifies to me,
77967 ^ saying
77968 ^ that chains and tribulations me await.
77974 ^ but not any account i make my life
77980 ^ dear to myself,
77982 ^ so as to finish the course of me, and the ministry
77990 ^ that i received from the lord jesus,
77996 ^ to testify fully the gospel of the grace - of god.
78003 ^ and now, behold,
78006 ^ i know
78008 ^ that no more you will see the face of me, you all
78016 ^ among whom i have gone about
78019 ^ proclaiming the kingdom.
78022 ^ therefore i testify to you in - this day,
78029 ^ that innocent i [am] of the blood of all;
78036 ^ not for i shrunk back
78039 ^ - not
78041 ^ from declaring all the counsel - of god to you.
78048 ^ take heed to yourselves and to all the flock
78054 ^ among which you the spirit - holy has set overseers,
78063 ^ to shepherd the church - of god,
78068 ^ which he purchased with - blood the own.
78075 ^ i know
78077 ^ that will come in after the departure of me wolves grievous among you,
78087 ^ not sparing the flock,
78091 ^ and out from your own selves will rise up men
78097 ^ speaking
78098 ^ perverse things,
78099 ^ - to draw away - disciples after them.
78105 ^ therefore stay awake,
78107 ^ remembering
78108 ^ that three years, night and day, not i ceased
78115 ^ with tears admonishing one each.
78120 ^ and - now i commit you to god and to the word of the grace of him,
78133 ^ - being able
78135 ^ to build up
78136 ^ and to give you an inheritance
78140 ^ among those having been sanctified all.
78144 ^ silver or gold or clothing of no one i coveted.
78151 ^ you yourselves know
78153 ^ that the needs of me
78157 ^ and to those being with me, ministered to the hands these.
78166 ^ in everything i showed you
78169 ^ that
78170 ^ by thus straining it behooves [us]
78173 ^ to aid
78174 ^ those being weak,
78176 ^ to remember and also the words of the lord jesus,
78183 ^ how he himself said,
78186 ^ blessed it is
78188 ^ more to give
78190 ^ than to receive.
78192 ^ and
78193 ^ these things having said,
78195 ^ having bowed the knee of him, with all them he prayed.
78203 ^ much then
78205 ^ weeping there was
78207 ^ among all;
78208 ^ and
78209 ^ having fallen upon the neck - of paul, they were kissing him,
78217 ^ sorrowing especially over the word
78222 ^ that he had spoken,
78224 ^ that no more they are about
78227 ^ the face of him to see.
78231 ^ they accompanied then him to the ship.
78237 ^ after then it happened
78240 ^ sailing our,
78242 ^ having drawn away from them,
78245 ^ having run directly we came to - cos,
78250 ^ - and
78252 ^ the next [day] to - rhodes,
78256 ^ and from there to patara.
78259 ^ and
78260 ^ having found a boat
78262 ^ passing over into phoenicia,
78265 ^ having gone on board, we set sail.
78267 ^ having sighted then
78269 ^ - cyprus
78271 ^ and having left it on the left, we kept sailing to syria
78278 ^ and landed at tyre.
78282 ^ there for the ship was
78287 ^ unloading the cargo.
78290 ^ having sought out then the disciples, we remained there days seven,
78298 ^ who - to paul kept telling through the spirit
78305 ^ not to go up to jerusalem.
78309 ^ when then it happened that
78312 ^ we had completed the days,
78316 ^ having set out, we journeyed,
78318 ^ accompanying us all with wives and children, as far as outside the city.
78329 ^ and
78330 ^ having bowed the knees on the shore,
78336 ^ having prayed, having said farewell to one another,
78339 ^ then we went up into the boat;
78344 ^ they then returned to the own.
78350 ^ we then,
78352 ^ the voyage having completed from tyre, came down to ptolemais,
78360 ^ and
78361 ^ having greeted the brothers, we stayed day one with them.
78369 ^ on the now
78371 ^ next day,
78372 ^ having gone forth, we came to caesarea;
78376 ^ and
78377 ^ having entered into the house of philip the evangelist,
78384 ^ being of the seven, we stayed with him.
78391 ^ with this [man] now there were
78394 ^ daughters four, virgins,
78397 ^ prophesying.
78398 ^ remaining now days many,
78402 ^ came down a certain one from - judea,
78407 ^ a prophet named agabus;
78410 ^ and
78411 ^ having come to us,
78414 ^ and having taken the belt - of paul,
78420 ^ having bound of himself the feet and the hands, he said,
78428 ^ thus says the spirit - holy,
78434 ^ the man
78436 ^ of whom is the belt this, in this way will bind in jerusalem the jews
78447 ^ and will deliver [him] into [the] hands of [the] gentiles.
78452 ^ when then we had heard these things,
78456 ^ began begging we both and those of that place,
78462 ^ - not
78464 ^ to go up him to jerusalem.
78468 ^ then answered - paul,
78472 ^ what are you doing,
78474 ^ weeping
78475 ^ and breaking my - heart?
78480 ^ i for
78482 ^ not only to be bound,
78485 ^ but also to die at jerusalem, readiness have, for the name of the lord jesus.
78498 ^ not being persuaded then of him,
78502 ^ we were silent,
78503 ^ having said,
78504 ^ of the lord the will be done.
78509 ^ after now
78511 ^ the days these,
78514 ^ having packed the baggage, we started on our way up to jerusalem.
78518 ^ went then also [some] of the disciples from caesarea with us,
78527 ^ bringing [one]
78528 ^ with whom we would lodge, mnason, a certain cypriot, an early disciple.
78536 ^ having arrived now we at jerusalem,
78541 ^ gladly received us the brothers.
78546 ^ on the now following [day], went in - paul with us unto james,
78556 ^ all and arrived
78559 ^ the elders.
78561 ^ and
78562 ^ having greeted them, he began to relate, by one each,
78568 ^ the things had done - god among the gentiles through the ministry of him.
78579 ^ those then
78581 ^ having heard began glorifying - god.
78585 ^ they said then to him,
78588 ^ you see, brother,
78590 ^ how many myriads there are among the jews
78596 ^ - having believed,
78598 ^ and all zealous ones for the law are.
78604 ^ they have been informed now about you,
78608 ^ that apostasy you teach,
78611 ^ from moses, those among the gentiles all jews,
78619 ^ telling
78620 ^ not to circumcise them the children,
78625 ^ nor in the customs to walk.
78629 ^ what then is it?
78632 ^ certainly they will hear
78634 ^ that you have come.
78636 ^ this therefore do you
78639 ^ what to you we say.
78642 ^ there are with us men four,
78646 ^ a vow having on themselves.
78650 ^ these [men] having taken, be purified with them
78655 ^ and bear expense for them,
78659 ^ so that they will shave the head,
78663 ^ and will know all
78666 ^ that
78667 ^ of which they have been informed about you nothing is,
78673 ^ but you walk orderly also yourself,
78677 ^ keeping the law.
78680 ^ concerning now
78682 ^ those
78683 ^ having believed of the gentiles, we wrote,
78687 ^ having adjudged
78688 ^ to keep from them, the things both sacrificed to idols, and blood, and what is strangled, and sexual immorality.
78699 ^ then - paul,
78702 ^ having taken the men, on the
78706 ^ following day,
78708 ^ with them having been purified, entered into the temple,
78715 ^ declaring the fulfillment of the days of the purification
78722 ^ until that was offered for one each of them the sacrifice.
78731 ^ when now were about the seven days
78737 ^ to be completed,
78738 ^ the from - asia jews,
78743 ^ having seen him in the temple, began stirring up all the crowd
78752 ^ and laid upon him the hands,
78758 ^ crying out,
78759 ^ men, israelites, help!
78762 ^ this is the man
78766 ^ who against the people and the law and the place this all those everywhere
78779 ^ teaching;
78780 ^ besides and also greeks he has brought into the temple
78788 ^ and defiled the holy place this.
78794 ^ it was they for
78796 ^ having previously seen trophimus the ephesian in the city with him,
78805 ^ whom they were supposing
78807 ^ that into the temple had brought - paul.
78814 ^ was thrown into commotion also the city whole,
78819 ^ and there was a rushing together of the people.
78824 ^ and
78825 ^ having laid hold - of paul, they dragged him outside the temple,
78833 ^ and immediately were shut the doors.
78838 ^ of them seeking then
78840 ^ him to kill,
78842 ^ there came a report to the commander of the cohort
78848 ^ that all was in an uproar
78851 ^ jerusalem,
78852 ^ who at once,
78854 ^ having taken with [him] soldiers and centurions, ran down upon them.
78861 ^ - and
78863 ^ having seen the commander and the soldiers, they stopped
78870 ^ beating - paul.
78873 ^ then
78874 ^ having drawn near, the commander laid hold of him
78879 ^ and commanded [him]
78881 ^ to be bound with chains two,
78884 ^ and began inquiring
78886 ^ who he might be
78888 ^ and
78889 ^ what it is he has been doing.
78892 ^ others however, another [or] one thing were crying out in the crowd.
78900 ^ not being able now he
78904 ^ to know the facts on account of the uproar,
78910 ^ he ordered
78911 ^ to be brought him into the barracks.
78916 ^ when now he came to the stairs,
78922 ^ it happened that
78923 ^ was carried he by the soldiers, because of the violence of the crowd.
78933 ^ were following for the multitude of the people,
78939 ^ crying out,
78940 ^ away with him.
78942 ^ being about then
78944 ^ to be brought into the barracks, - paul says to the commander,
78953 ^ if is it permitted to me
78956 ^ to say something to you?
78960 ^ - then he was saying,
78963 ^ greek do you know?
78965 ^ not then you are the egyptian
78971 ^ - before these the days
78976 ^ having led a revolt
78977 ^ and having led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the assassins?
78987 ^ said however - paul,
78991 ^ i a man indeed am
78995 ^ a jew of tarsus, - of cilicia, not [of an] insignificant city a citizen.
79003 ^ i implore now you,
79006 ^ allow me
79008 ^ to speak to the people.
79012 ^ having allowed [him] then he,
79015 ^ - paul,
79017 ^ having stood on the stairs, made a sign with the hand to the people;
79026 ^ great then
79028 ^ silence having taken place,
79030 ^ he spoke to [them] in the hebrew language,
79034 ^ saying:
79035 ^ men, brothers, and fathers, hear of me the to you now defense.
79046 ^ having heard then
79048 ^ that in the hebrew language he was addressing them, even more they became quiet.
79057 ^ and he says,
79059 ^ i am a man, a jew,
79063 ^ born in tarsus - of cilicia,
79068 ^ brought up now in the city this
79074 ^ at the feet of gamaliel, having been instructed according to [the] exactness of the of our fathers law,
79084 ^ a zealous one being
79086 ^ - for god,
79088 ^ even as all you are this day;
79093 ^ who this - way persecuted as far as death,
79100 ^ binding
79101 ^ and betraying to prisons men both and women,
79109 ^ as also the high priest bears witness to me,
79115 ^ and all the elderhood;
79119 ^ from whom also
79122 ^ letters, having received to the brothers, to damascus i was on my way
79130 ^ to bring also
79132 ^ those there
79134 ^ being,
79135 ^ bound to jerusalem,
79138 ^ in order that they might be punished.
79140 ^ it happened however to me
79143 ^ journeying
79144 ^ and drawing near - to damascus, about noon,
79150 ^ suddenly out of - heaven shone a light great around me.
79159 ^ i fell then to the ground
79164 ^ and heard a voice
79167 ^ saying to me,
79169 ^ saul, saul, why me persecute you?
79174 ^ i then answered,
79177 ^ who are you, lord?
79180 ^ he said then to me,
79184 ^ i am jesus of nazareth,
79189 ^ whom you are persecuting.
79192 ^ those then with me being, the indeed
79199 ^ light beheld;
79201 ^ the however
79203 ^ voice not did they hear
79206 ^ of the [one] speaking to me.
79209 ^ i said then,
79211 ^ what shall i do, lord?
79214 ^ - and
79216 ^ the lord said to me,
79220 ^ having risen up go to damascus,
79224 ^ and there you it will be told concerning all things
79229 ^ that it has been appointed you
79232 ^ to do.
79233 ^ while now, not i could see from the brightness of the light that,
79243 ^ being led by the hand
79244 ^ by those being with me, i came to damascus.
79251 ^ ananias then
79253 ^ certain, a man devout according to the law,
79259 ^ borne witness to by all the
79263 ^ dwelling [there] jews,
79265 ^ having come to me
79268 ^ and having stood by [me], said to me,
79272 ^ saul brother, receive your sight.
79275 ^ and i the same - hour looked up at him.
79282 ^ - and he said,
79285 ^ the god of the fathers of us has appointed you
79292 ^ to know the will of him,
79296 ^ and to see the righteous one,
79300 ^ and to hear [the] voice out of the mouth of him.
79307 ^ for you will be a witness for him to all men
79314 ^ of what you have seen
79316 ^ and heard.
79318 ^ and now why delay you?
79322 ^ having arisen, be baptized
79324 ^ and wash away the sins of you,
79329 ^ calling on the name of him.
79333 ^ it happened then to me,
79336 ^ having returned to jerusalem,
79339 ^ and praying of my in the temple,
79345 ^ fell i into a trance
79349 ^ and saw him
79352 ^ saying to me,
79354 ^ make haste
79355 ^ and go away with speed out of jerusalem,
79361 ^ because not they will receive your testimony about me.
79368 ^ and i said,
79370 ^ lord, they themselves know
79373 ^ that i was
79376 ^ imprisoning
79377 ^ and beating in each of those synagogues
79382 ^ those believing on you.
79386 ^ and when was poured out the blood of stephen, the witness of you,
79395 ^ also i myself was
79398 ^ standing by,
79399 ^ and consenting,
79401 ^ and watching over the garments
79405 ^ of those killing him.
79408 ^ and he said to me,
79412 ^ go,
79413 ^ for i to [the] gentiles far away will send you.
79420 ^ they were listening now to him until this - word,
79427 ^ and they lifted up the voice of them,
79432 ^ saying,
79433 ^ away with from the earth, the such.
79439 ^ not for it is fit
79442 ^ he to live!
79444 ^ were crying out then they,
79447 ^ and casting off the garments,
79451 ^ and dust throwing into the air.
79457 ^ ordered the commander
79460 ^ to be brought him into the barracks,
79465 ^ having directed
79466 ^ by flogging to be examined him,
79469 ^ so that he might know
79471 ^ for what cause like this they were crying out against him.
79477 ^ as however he stretched forward him with the straps,
79483 ^ said to the
79486 ^ standing by centurion - paul,
79490 ^ if
79491 ^ a man, a roman and uncondemned, it is lawful to you to flog?
79498 ^ having heard then the centurion,
79502 ^ having gone to the commander, he reported [it],
79506 ^ saying,
79507 ^ what are you going to do?
79510 ^ the for
79512 ^ man this a roman is.
79516 ^ having come near then, the commander said to him,
79522 ^ tell me,
79524 ^ you a roman are?
79527 ^ - and he was saying,
79530 ^ yes.
79531 ^ answered then the commander,
79535 ^ i with a great sum the citizenship this bought.
79542 ^ - but
79544 ^ paul was saying,
79546 ^ i however even was born [so].
79550 ^ immediately therefore departed from him
79555 ^ those being about
79557 ^ him to examine,
79559 ^ and the commander also was afraid,
79564 ^ having ascertained
79565 ^ that a roman he is,
79568 ^ and because
79570 ^ him he had bound.
79573 ^ on the now
79575 ^ next day,
79576 ^ desiring
79577 ^ to know - for certain -
79581 ^ why he is accused by the jews, he unbound him
79588 ^ and commanded
79590 ^ to assemble the chief priests and all the council.
79597 ^ and
79598 ^ having brought down - paul, he set [him] among them.
79604 ^ having looked intently then - paul at the council, he said,
79611 ^ men, brothers, i in all conscience good have lived as a citizen - to god unto this - day.
79624 ^ - then
79626 ^ the high priest ananias commanded
79629 ^ those standing by him
79632 ^ to strike of him the mouth.
79636 ^ then - paul to him said,
79642 ^ to strike you is about - god, wall
79648 ^ whitewashed!
79649 ^ and you, do you sit
79652 ^ judging me according to the law,
79657 ^ and
79658 ^ violating law, command
79660 ^ me to be struck?
79662 ^ those who now stood by said,
79666 ^ the high priest - of god do you insult?
79671 ^ was saying then - paul,
79675 ^ not i was aware, brothers,
79678 ^ that he is high priest;
79681 ^ it has been written for
79683 ^ -: [the] ruler of the people of you, not you shall speak evil [of].’
79691 ^ having known then - paul
79695 ^ that the one part consists of sadducees,
79701 ^ - but
79703 ^ the other of pharisees, he began crying out in the council,
79709 ^ men, brothers, i a pharisee am,
79714 ^ [the] son of a pharisee;
79716 ^ concerning [the] hope and resurrection of [the] dead i am judged.
79723 ^ this then of him saying,
79727 ^ arose a dissension between the pharisees and sadducees,
79733 ^ and was divided the crowd.
79737 ^ sadducees indeed for say
79741 ^ not there to be resurrection,
79744 ^ nor angel,
79746 ^ nor spirit;
79748 ^ pharisees however confess - both.
79753 ^ arose then a clamor great,
79757 ^ and
79758 ^ having risen up some of the scribes of the party of the pharisees, they were contending,
79767 ^ saying,
79768 ^ nothing evil we find in the man this.
79775 ^ what if now a spirit has spoken to him,
79780 ^ or an angel?
79782 ^ great then arising dissension,
79786 ^ having feared the commander,
79789 ^ lest should be torn to pieces - paul by them, he commanded the troop,
79798 ^ having gone down, to take by force him from midst of them,
79804 ^ to bring [him] then into the barracks.
79809 ^ - but
79811 ^ the following night,
79813 ^ having stood by him, the lord said,
79818 ^ take courage,
79819 ^ as for you have fully testified - about me at jerusalem,
79827 ^ so you it behooves also in rome to testify.
79834 ^ when it was then day,
79837 ^ having made a conspiracy, the jews put under an oath themselves,
79843 ^ declaring
79844 ^ neither to eat
79846 ^ nor to drink
79848 ^ until that they should kill - paul.
79853 ^ there were now more than forty,
79857 ^ - this - plot
79861 ^ having made,
79862 ^ who,
79863 ^ having come to the chief priests and the elders, said,
79870 ^ with an oath we have bound ourselves,
79873 ^ nothing to eat
79875 ^ until that we should kill - paul.
79880 ^ now therefore you, make a report to the commander along with the council,
79889 ^ so that he might bring down him to you,
79894 ^ as being about
79896 ^ to examine more earnestly the things about him;
79901 ^ we then,
79903 ^ before - drawing near his, ready are
79909 ^ - to kill him.
79912 ^ having heard however the son of the sister of paul of the ambush,
79921 ^ having come near
79922 ^ and having entered into the barracks, he reported [it] - to paul.
79930 ^ having called to [him] then - paul one of the centurions, he was saying,
79938 ^ the young man this take to the commander;
79945 ^ he has for
79947 ^ to report something to him.
79950 ^ the [one] indeed therefore
79953 ^ having taken him brought [him] to the commander,
79959 ^ and he says,
79961 ^ the prisoner paul,
79964 ^ having called to me, asked [me]
79967 ^ this - young man to lead to you,
79973 ^ having
79974 ^ something to say to you.
79977 ^ having taken hold then
79979 ^ the hand of him the commander,
79984 ^ and having withdrawn in private, he began to inquire,
79989 ^ what is it
79991 ^ that you have to report to me?
79995 ^ he said then
79997 ^ -, the jews have agreed
80001 ^ - to ask you
80004 ^ that tomorrow - paul you might bring down into the council,
80012 ^ as being about
80014 ^ something more earnestly to inquire about him.
80019 ^ you therefore not should be persuaded by them.
80024 ^ lie in wait indeed for him of them men more than forty,
80032 ^ who have put under an oath themselves
80035 ^ neither to eat
80037 ^ nor to drink
80039 ^ until that they have killed him;
80043 ^ and now they are ready,
80047 ^ awaiting the from you promise.
80052 ^ - indeed therefore
80055 ^ the commander dismissed the young man,
80059 ^ having instructed [him],
80060 ^ no one tell
80062 ^ that these things you have reported to me.
80067 ^ and
80068 ^ having called to [him] two certain of the centurions, he said,
80074 ^ prepare soldiers two hundred,
80077 ^ so that they might go as far as caesarea,
80081 ^ and horsemen seventy, and spearmen two hundred, for the third hour of the night.
80092 ^ mounts then provide,
80095 ^ so that
80096 ^ having set upon [them] - paul, they might bring [him] safely to felix the governor,
80104 ^ having written a letter,
80106 ^ having the form this:
80110 ^ claudius lysias, to the most excellent governor, felix:
80116 ^ greetings.
80117 ^ the man this,
80120 ^ having been seized by the jews,
80124 ^ and being about
80126 ^ to be killed by them,
80129 ^ having come up with the troop, i rescued [him],
80134 ^ having learned
80135 ^ that a roman he is.
80138 ^ resolving then
80140 ^ to know the charge
80143 ^ on account of which they were accusing him, i brought [him] down to the council of them,
80152 ^ whom i found
80154 ^ being accused concerning questions of the law of them,
80160 ^ no however
80162 ^ worthy of death or of chains having
80167 ^ accusation.
80168 ^ it having been disclosed then to me of a plot that
80172 ^ against the man would be,
80176 ^ at once i sent [him] to you,
80180 ^ having instructed also the accusers
80184 ^ to speak these things against him before you.
80190 ^ - indeed therefore
80193 ^ the soldiers,
80194 ^ according to that having been ordered them,
80198 ^ having taken - paul, brought [him] by night to - antipatris.
80207 ^ on the now
80209 ^ next day,
80210 ^ having allowed the horsemen
80213 ^ to go with him, they returned to the barracks,
80220 ^ who
80221 ^ having entered into - caesarea
80225 ^ and having delivered the letter to the governor, presented also - paul to him.
80236 ^ having read [it] then,
80238 ^ and having asked
80240 ^ from what province he is,
80244 ^ and having learned
80246 ^ that from cilicia [he is],
80249 ^ i will hear fully you, he was saying,
80252 ^ when also the accusers of you may have arrived,
80258 ^ having commanded
80259 ^ in the praetorium - of herod to be guarded him.
80266 ^ after then
80268 ^ five days, came down the high priest ananias, with elders some and an orator tertullus certain,
80281 ^ who made a representation to the governor against - paul.
80288 ^ having been called then of him,
80291 ^ began
80292 ^ to accuse - tertullus,
80295 ^ saying,
80296 ^ great peace we are attaining through you,
80301 ^ and excellent measures are being done to the nation this through - your foresight, in every way both and everywhere, we gladly accept [it], most excellent felix, with all thankfulness.
80321 ^ in order that however not to any longer you i should be a hindrance,
80328 ^ i implore
80329 ^ to hear you us briefly, [in] your kindness.
80336 ^ having found for the man this a pest,
80342 ^ and stirring insurrection among all the jews - in the world, a leader then of the of the nazarenes sect,
80358 ^ who even
80360 ^ the temple attempted to profane,
80364 ^ whom also we seized.
80367 ^ from him you will be able yourself,
80371 ^ having examined [him] concerning all these things, to know
80376 ^ of which we accuse him.
80380 ^ agreed then also the jews,
80385 ^ declaring
80386 ^ these things so to be.
80389 ^ answered then - paul,
80393 ^ having made a sign to him the governor
80397 ^ to speak:
80398 ^ for many years, as being you judge to nation, this knowing, cheerfully to the things concerning myself i make a defense.
80413 ^ being able you
80415 ^ to know
80416 ^ that not more than there are to me days
80422 ^ twelve,
80423 ^ from which i went up
80426 ^ to worship in jerusalem.
80429 ^ and neither
80431 ^ in the temple did they find
80435 ^ me
80436 ^ with anyone reasoning,
80439 ^ or
80440 ^ a tumultuous gathering making
80442 ^ of a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city.
80451 ^ nor
80452 ^ to prove are they able to you,
80455 ^ concerning [the things] of which now they accuse me.
80460 ^ i confess however this to you,
80464 ^ that according to the way
80468 ^ which they call a sect,
80471 ^ so i serve the of our fathers god,
80476 ^ believing all things - throughout the law,
80482 ^ and that in the prophets
80487 ^ have been written,
80488 ^ a hope having in - god
80493 ^ which also they themselves await,
80498 ^ [that] a resurrection there is about
80500 ^ to be
80501 ^ of [the] just both and of [the] unjust.
80505 ^ in this also i myself strive,
80510 ^ without offense a conscience to have toward - god and - men, through everything.
80521 ^ after years now
80524 ^ many,
80525 ^ alms to bring to the nation of me, i arrived,
80532 ^ and offerings,
80534 ^ during which they found me
80538 ^ purified in the temple, not with a crowd, nor in tumult.
80548 ^ some however [are]
80550 ^ from - asia, jews
80554 ^ who ought
80556 ^ before you to appear
80559 ^ and to make accusation,
80561 ^ if anything they may have against me.
80566 ^ otherwise themselves it let them say
80570 ^ any they found
80572 ^ unrighteousness,
80573 ^ having stood in me before the council,
80578 ^ [other] than concerning one this voice
80583 ^ which i cried out
80585 ^ among them standing
80588 ^ -: concerning [the] resurrection of [the] dead i am judged this day by you.
80597 ^ put off however them - felix,
80602 ^ more precisely having knowledge of the things concerning the way,
80608 ^ having said,
80609 ^ when lysias the commander might have come down,
80614 ^ i will examine the things as to you,
80618 ^ having commanded the centurion
80621 ^ to keep him,
80623 ^ to [let him] have then ease,
80626 ^ and not to forbid
80629 ^ the own of him
80632 ^ to minister to him.
80634 ^ after then
80636 ^ days some,
80638 ^ having arrived - felix with drusilla, the own wife,
80646 ^ being a jewess, he sent for - paul
80651 ^ and heard him concerning the in christ jesus faith.
80660 ^ reasoning then he concerning righteousness and self-control and the judgment
80670 ^ - coming,
80672 ^ frightened having become, - felix answered,
80677 ^ for the present
80679 ^ being go away;
80681 ^ opportunity then having found, i will call for you.
80686 ^ at the same time also,
80688 ^ he is hoping
80689 ^ that riches will be given him by - paul.
80696 ^ therefore also often
80699 ^ him sending for, he was talking with him.
80703 ^ two years however having been completed,
80706 ^ received [as] successor - felix,
80710 ^ porcius festus;
80712 ^ wishing then
80714 ^ favor to acquire for himself with the jews, - felix left - paul
80723 ^ imprisoned.
80724 ^ festus therefore
80726 ^ having arrived in the province, after three days he went up to jerusalem from caesarea.
80737 ^ made a presentation before then him the chief priests and the chiefs of the jews, against - paul,
80750 ^ and they were begging him,
80753 ^ asking a favor against him,
80757 ^ that he would summon him to jerusalem,
80762 ^ an ambush forming
80764 ^ to kill him on the way.
80769 ^ - indeed therefore
80772 ^ festus answered that
80774 ^ is to be kept - paul in caesarea;
80779 ^ he himself now is about
80782 ^ in quickness to set out.
80785 ^ those therefore
80787 ^ among you,
80789 ^ he says, [those] in power,
80791 ^ having gone down too,
80792 ^ if anything there is in the man
80798 ^ wrong,
80799 ^ let them accuse him.
80801 ^ having spent then with them days not more than
80808 ^ eight or ten,
80811 ^ having gone down to caesarea,
80814 ^ on the next day having sat on the judgment seat, he commanded
80821 ^ - paul to be brought.
80824 ^ having arrived then he,
80827 ^ stood around him the
80830 ^ from jerusalem having come down jews,
80834 ^ many and weighty charges bringing,
80839 ^ which not they were able to prove.
80843 ^ - paul made his defense
80846 ^ -: neither against the law of the jews, nor against the temple, nor against caesar, [in] anything have i sinned.
80862 ^ - festus however,
80865 ^ wishing
80866 ^ on the jews a favor to lay,
80870 ^ answering - paul, said,
80874 ^ are you willing
80875 ^ to jerusalem having gone up, there concerning these things to be judged before me?
80884 ^ said then - paul,
80888 ^ before the judgment seat of caesar
80892 ^ standing i am,
80894 ^ where me it behooves to be judged.
80898 ^ to [the] jews nothing i have done wrong,
80901 ^ as also you very well know.
80906 ^ if indeed therefore i do wrong,
80910 ^ and worthy of death have done
80914 ^ anything,
80915 ^ not i do refuse
80917 ^ - to die.
80919 ^ if however nothing there is
80923 ^ of which they [can] accuse me,
80927 ^ no one
80928 ^ me can to them give up.
80932 ^ to caesar i appeal!
80934 ^ then - festus,
80937 ^ having conferred with the council, answered,
80942 ^ to caesar you have appealed;
80944 ^ to caesar you will go!
80947 ^ days now having passed
80950 ^ some,
80951 ^ agrippa the king and bernice came down to caesarea,
80959 ^ greeting - festus.
80962 ^ as now many days they stayed there,
80968 ^ - festus, the king laid before, the things relating to - paul,
80977 ^ saying,
80978 ^ a man certain there is
80981 ^ left by felix [as] a prisoner,
80985 ^ concerning whom,
80987 ^ having been my in jerusalem, made a presentation the chief priests and the elders of the jews,
80999 ^ asking against him judgment,
81003 ^ to whom i answered
81006 ^ that not it is [the] custom with romans
81011 ^ to give up any man
81014 ^ before that
81016 ^ the [one] being accused to face may have [it] the accusers
81023 ^ [the] opportunity, and
81025 ^ of defense he may have concerning the accusation.
81030 ^ having come together therefore of them here,
81034 ^ delay no having made,
81037 ^ the next [day] having sat on the judgment seat, i commanded
81044 ^ to be brought the man,
81047 ^ concerning whom,
81049 ^ having stood up, the accusers no charge were bringing
81055 ^ of which i was expecting crimes.
81059 ^ questions however
81061 ^ certain concerning the own religion they had against him,
81069 ^ and concerning a certain jesus
81073 ^ having been dead,
81074 ^ whom was affirming - paul to be alive.
81079 ^ being perplexed now, i - concerning this inquiry was asking
81087 ^ if he was willing
81089 ^ to go to jerusalem
81092 ^ and there to be judged concerning these things.
81096 ^ - but
81098 ^ of paul having appealed for
81100 ^ to be kept himself for the - emperor's decision,
81107 ^ i commanded
81108 ^ to be kept him
81110 ^ until that i might send him to caesar.
81116 ^ agrippa then [said] to - festus,
81121 ^ i have been wanting also myself
81124 ^ the man to hear.
81127 ^ tomorrow,
81128 ^ he says, you will hear him.
81131 ^ on the therefore
81133 ^ next day, having come - agrippa and - bernice with great pomp,
81143 ^ and having entered into the audience hall, with both [the] commanders and men - in prominence in the city,
81158 ^ and having commanded - festus,
81162 ^ was brought in - paul.
81165 ^ and says - festus,
81169 ^ agrippa king, and all the
81174 ^ being present with us men, you see this one,
81179 ^ concerning whom all the multitude of the jews pleaded with me, in both jerusalem and here,
81193 ^ crying out [that]
81194 ^ not he ought
81196 ^ of him to live no longer.
81199 ^ i however, having understood
81202 ^ nothing worthy him
81205 ^ of death to have done,
81207 ^ himself and
81209 ^ of this one having appealed to the emperor,
81213 ^ i determined
81214 ^ to send [him],
81215 ^ concerning whom, definite anything to write to [my] lord, not i have.
81224 ^ therefore i have brought him before you all, and especially before you, king agrippa,
81235 ^ so that the examination having taken place,
81239 ^ i might have
81240 ^ something to write.
81242 ^ absurd for to me it seems
81246 ^ [in] sending a prisoner, not also the against him charges to specify.
81255 ^ agrippa then to - paul was saying,
81261 ^ it is permitted you
81263 ^ for yourself to speak.
81266 ^ then - paul,
81269 ^ having stretched out the hand, began his defense:
81273 ^ concerning all
81275 ^ of which i am accused by [the] jews, king agrippa, i esteem myself fortunate
81284 ^ before you, being about today to defend myself.
81289 ^ especially acquainted being you
81293 ^ with all the of [the] jews customs, and also controversies;
81301 ^ therefore i implore [you]
81303 ^ patiently to hear me.
81306 ^ the indeed then
81309 ^ manner of life of me, which [is] from youth,
81314 ^ - from [its] beginning
81317 ^ having been among the nation of me, in also jerusalem, know all the jews,
81329 ^ knowing me from the first,
81332 ^ if they would be willing
81334 ^ to testify,
81335 ^ that according to the strictest sect - of our religion i lived [as] a pharisee.
81345 ^ and now for [the] hope of the to the fathers of us promise having been made by - god, i stand
81360 ^ being judged,
81361 ^ to which the twelve tribes of us
81366 ^ in earnestness, night and day, serving, hope
81373 ^ to attain;
81374 ^ concerning which hope i am accused by the jews, o king.
81381 ^ why incredible is it judged by you
81386 ^ if - god [the] dead raises?
81391 ^ i indeed therefore thought in myself
81396 ^ to the name of jesus - of nazareth, i ought many things contrary to do,
81406 ^ which also i did in jerusalem;
81411 ^ and many also of the saints i in prisons locked up,
81420 ^ the from the chief priests authority having received;
81426 ^ being put to death then they,
81429 ^ i cast against [them] a vote.
81431 ^ and
81432 ^ in all the synagogues, often punishing them, i was compelling [them]
81440 ^ to blaspheme.
81441 ^ exceedingly then being furious against them, i kept persecuting [them] as far as even
81448 ^ to - foreign cities,
81452 ^ during which, journeying to - damascus with [the] authority and commission of the chief priests, day mid on the road i saw, o king, from heaven above, the brightness of the sun,
81478 ^ having shone around me, a light;
81481 ^ and those with me
81485 ^ journeying.
81486 ^ all and having fallen down
81489 ^ of us to the ground,
81493 ^ i heard a voice
81495 ^ saying to me in the hebrew language,
81501 ^ saul, saul, why me persecute you?
81506 ^ [it is] hard for you
81508 ^ against [the] goads to kick.
81511 ^ i then said,
81514 ^ who are you, lord?
81517 ^ - and
81519 ^ the lord said,
81521 ^ i am jesus,
81524 ^ whom you are persecuting.
81527 ^ but rise up
81529 ^ and stand on the feet of you;
81535 ^ for this purpose for i have appeared to you,
81540 ^ to appoint you a servant and a witness
81545 ^ of that which both you have seen of me,
81549 ^ of the things in which then i will appear to you,
81553 ^ delivering you out from the people and from the gentiles,
81562 ^ to whom i am sending you,
81567 ^ to open eyes of them,
81570 ^ that they may turn from darkness to light,
81576 ^ and from the power - of satan to - god,
81584 ^ [that] may receive they forgiveness of sins and [an] inheritance
81591 ^ among those having been sanctified by faith that [is] in me.
81598 ^ so then, o king agrippa, not i was disobedient to the heavenly vision,
81607 ^ but to those in damascus first, both and jerusalem all, and the region - of judea, and to the gentiles, i kept declaring
81625 ^ to repent
81626 ^ and to turn to - god,
81631 ^ worthy - of repentance works doing.
81636 ^ on account of these things,
81638 ^ me the jews having seized
81641 ^ being in the temple, they were attempting
81646 ^ to kill.
81647 ^ help therefore having obtained - from - god unto the day this, i have stood,
81659 ^ bearing witness to small both and to great, nothing
81665 ^ other saying
81667 ^ than what both the prophets said
81672 ^ was about
81673 ^ to happen,
81674 ^ and moses,
81676 ^ that would suffer the christ;
81680 ^ as first through resurrection from [the] dead,
81685 ^ light he is about to preach to both our people and to the gentiles.
81694 ^ these things now of him saying in his defense,
81698 ^ - festus in a loud - voice said,
81704 ^ you are insane, paul!
81706 ^ the great of you
81709 ^ learning, to insanity turns [you]!
81713 ^ - but
81715 ^ paul,
81716 ^ not i am insane, says,
81719 ^ most excellent festus, but of truth and sobriety words i utter.
81727 ^ understands for concerning these things the king,
81733 ^ to whom also
81736 ^ using boldness i speak.
81738 ^ are hidden from for him any of these things not. i am persuaded
81745 ^ none
81746 ^ not for is
81749 ^ in a corner done, of these things.
81753 ^ believe you, king agrippa, the prophets?
81758 ^ i know
81759 ^ that you believe.
81761 ^ - then
81763 ^ agrippa [said] to - paul,
81767 ^ within so little me do you persuade
81771 ^ a christian to become?
81773 ^ - and
81775 ^ paul [said],
81776 ^ i would wish - - to god,
81780 ^ both in a little and in much, not only you
81789 ^ but also all those hearing me this day, to become such
81798 ^ as also i am, except the chains these.
81806 ^ rose up then the king and the governor - and bernice
81816 ^ and those sitting with them,
81820 ^ and
81821 ^ having withdrawn, they began speaking to one another
81825 ^ saying
81826 ^ -, nothing of death or of chains worthy any is doing the man this.
81837 ^ agrippa then to festus was saying,
81842 ^ have been released could the man this,
81847 ^ if not he had appealed to caesar.
81851 ^ when now was determined
81854 ^ - sailing our to - italy,
81860 ^ they delivered - both paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion, named julius of the cohort of augustus.
81873 ^ having boarded then a ship of adramyttium
81877 ^ being about
81878 ^ to sail to the along - asia places, we set sail —
81886 ^ being with us aristarchus, a macedonian of thessalonica.
81892 ^ the then
81894 ^ next [day], we landed at sidon.
81898 ^ considerately then - julius, - paul having treated, allowed [him]
81906 ^ to his friends having gone, care to receive.
81912 ^ and from there
81913 ^ having set sail, we sailed under - cyprus,
81917 ^ because of - the winds
81921 ^ being contrary.
81923 ^ - and then - along - cilicia and pamphylia, having sailed across [the sea], we came to myra - of lycia.
81938 ^ and there,
81939 ^ having found the centurion a ship of alexandria
81944 ^ sailing to - italy, he placed us into it.
81952 ^ for many now
81955 ^ days, sailing slowly
81957 ^ and with difficulty, having arrived off - cnidus,
81963 ^ not permitting us the wind, we sailed under - crete, off salmone.
81973 ^ with difficulty and coasting along it, we came to a place certain
81981 ^ called fair havens,
81984 ^ to which near [the] city was
81988 ^ of lasea.
81989 ^ much now
81991 ^ time having passed,
81993 ^ and being already dangerous the voyage,
81999 ^ because of - even the fast already
82005 ^ being over,
82006 ^ was admonishing [them] - paul,
82009 ^ saying to them,
82011 ^ men, i understand
82013 ^ that
82014 ^ with disaster and much loss, not only of the cargo and of the ship, but also the lives of us, is about to be the voyage.
82035 ^ - but
82037 ^ the centurion by the pilot and the ship owner rather was persuaded,
82045 ^ than
82046 ^ by the things by paul
82049 ^ spoken.
82050 ^ unsuitable now the harbor being to winter in,
82057 ^ the majority reached a decision
82061 ^ to set sail from there,
82063 ^ if somehow they might be able,
82066 ^ having arrived at phoenix, to winter [there] — a harbor - of crete,
82073 ^ looking toward [the] southwest and toward [the] northwest.
82079 ^ having blown gently now a south wind,
82082 ^ having thought
82083 ^ the purpose to have obtained,
82086 ^ having weighed [anchor], very near they began coasting along - crete.
82091 ^ after not long however, there came down from it a wind tempestuous,
82100 ^ - called the northeaster.
82103 ^ having been caught then the ship,
82107 ^ and not being able
82110 ^ to face to the wind,
82113 ^ having given way we were driven along.
82115 ^ an island then certain having run under,
82119 ^ called cauda, we were able with difficulty
82123 ^ control to gain
82125 ^ of the lifeboat,
82127 ^ which having taken up, supports they began using,
82131 ^ undergirding the ship.
82134 ^ fearing then
82136 ^ lest into the sandbars of syrtis they should fall,
82141 ^ having lowered the gear, thus they were driven along.
82146 ^ violently now being storm-tossed of us, on the next [day]
82152 ^ a jettison of cargo they began to make,
82154 ^ and on the third [day], with [their] own hands the tackle of the ship they cast away.
82163 ^ neither now sun nor stars appearing for many days,
82172 ^ tempest and
82174 ^ no small lying on [us],
82177 ^ from then on was abandoned hope all
82181 ^ - being saved of us.
82184 ^ much also time without food there being,
82188 ^ at that time
82189 ^ having stood up - paul in midst of them, he said,
82196 ^ it behooved [you] indeed, o men,
82200 ^ having been obedient to me, not to have set sail from - crete,
82207 ^ to have incurred then the disaster this and - loss.
82215 ^ and yet - now i exhort you
82220 ^ to keep up your courage;
82221 ^ loss for
82223 ^ of life none there will be
82226 ^ from among you, only of the ship.
82231 ^ stood by for me this - night -, of god,
82239 ^ whose am i
82242 ^ whom and i serve, an angel,
82246 ^ saying,
82247 ^ not fear, paul;
82250 ^ caesar you it behooves to stand before.
82254 ^ and behold,
82256 ^ has granted to you - god
82260 ^ all those sailing with you.
82265 ^ therefore take courage, men;
82268 ^ i believe for - god
82272 ^ that thus it will be,
82275 ^ according to the way it has been said to me.
82280 ^ upon an island however certain it behooves
82285 ^ us to fall.
82287 ^ when then the fourteenth night had come,
82292 ^ being driven about of us in the adriatic,
82297 ^ toward [the] middle of the night, began sensing the sailors
82304 ^ to be drawing near some to them
82307 ^ land.
82308 ^ and
82309 ^ having taken soundings, they found fathoms twenty.
82313 ^ a little then
82315 ^ having gone farther
82316 ^ and again having taken soundings, they found fathoms fifteen.
82322 ^ fearing then
82324 ^ lest somewhere on rocky places we might fall,
82330 ^ out of [the] stern having cast anchors four, they were praying for
82336 ^ day to come.
82338 ^ of the then
82340 ^ sailors seeking
82342 ^ to flee out of the ship
82346 ^ and having let down the lifeboat into the sea
82353 ^ under pretense as
82355 ^ from [the] bow anchors being about to cast out,
82360 ^ said - paul to the centurion and to the soldiers,
82368 ^ if not these remain in the ship,
82375 ^ you
82376 ^ to be saved not are able.
82379 ^ then cut away the soldiers the ropes of the lifeboat,
82387 ^ and allowed her
82390 ^ to fall away.
82391 ^ until then that day was about
82396 ^ to come, kept urging - paul all
82401 ^ to partake of food,
82403 ^ saying,
82404 ^ the fourteenth today
82406 ^ [is] day
82407 ^ watching without eating you continue,
82410 ^ nothing having taken.
82412 ^ therefore i exhort you
82415 ^ to take food;
82417 ^ this indeed for - of you preservation is;
82424 ^ not one for
82426 ^ of you a hair of the head will perish.
82432 ^ having said now
82434 ^ these things
82435 ^ and having taken bread, he gave thanks - to god before all,
82443 ^ and
82444 ^ having broken [it], he began
82446 ^ to eat.
82447 ^ encouraged then having been, all also
82452 ^ themselves took food.
82455 ^ we were then the altogether souls in the ship, two hundred seventy six.
82466 ^ having been filled then with food, they began to lighten the ship,
82472 ^ casting out the wheat into the sea.
82478 ^ when now day it was,
82482 ^ the land not they did recognize;
82486 ^ a bay however
82488 ^ certain they noticed,
82490 ^ having a shore,
82492 ^ on which they determined,
82495 ^ if they should be able,
82497 ^ to drive the ship.
82500 ^ and
82501 ^ the anchors having cut away, they left [them] in the sea,
82508 ^ at the same time
82509 ^ having loosened the ropes of the rudders.
82514 ^ and having hoisted the foresail
82518 ^ to the blowing [wind], they began making for the shore.
82524 ^ having fallen however into a place between two seas, they ran aground the vessel;
82532 ^ and the indeed
82535 ^ bow
82536 ^ having stuck fast, it remained immovable,
82539 ^ - and
82541 ^ the stern was being broken up by the violence of the waves.
82548 ^ of the now
82550 ^ soldiers, [the] plan was
82553 ^ that the prisoners they should kill,
82557 ^ lest anyone,
82559 ^ having swum away, should escape.
82561 ^ - but
82563 ^ the centurion,
82564 ^ desiring
82565 ^ to save - paul, hindered them of [the] purpose;
82572 ^ he commanded then
82574 ^ those being able
82576 ^ to swim,
82577 ^ having cast [themselves] off first, on the land to go out,
82583 ^ and the rest,
82586 ^ some indeed on boards,
82590 ^ some then on things - from the ship.
82598 ^ and thus it came to pass that
82601 ^ all were brought safely to the land.
82606 ^ and
82607 ^ having been saved, then we found out
82610 ^ that malta the island is called.
82615 ^ - and
82617 ^ the natives were showing not [just] the ordinary kindness to us.
82624 ^ having kindled for a fire, they received all of us because of the rain
82633 ^ - coming on and because of the cold.
82639 ^ having gathered now - paul of sticks a quantity,
82646 ^ and having laid [them] on the fire,
82651 ^ a viper
82652 ^ out from the heat having come, fastened on the hand of him.
82660 ^ when then saw the natives hanging the beast from the hand of him,
82672 ^ to one another they began to say,
82675 ^ by all means a murderer is the man this,
82681 ^ whom
82682 ^ having been saved from the sea, - justice
82688 ^ to live not has permitted.
82691 ^ the [one] indeed then,
82694 ^ having shaken off the creature into the fire, he suffered no injury.
82703 ^ - but they were expecting
82706 ^ him to be about
82708 ^ to become inflamed,
82709 ^ or to fall down suddenly dead.
82713 ^ a while great however of them waiting
82718 ^ and seeing nothing amiss
82722 ^ to him happening,
82725 ^ having changed their opinion, they began declaring
82727 ^ him to be a god.
82730 ^ in now
82732 ^ the [parts] around the place that were lands belonging to the chief of the island, named publius,
82745 ^ who
82746 ^ having received us three, days hospitably entertained [us].
82752 ^ it came to pass then,
82754 ^ the father - of publius,
82758 ^ fevers and dysentery oppressed with, was lying,
82763 ^ toward whom - paul,
82767 ^ having entered
82768 ^ and having prayed,
82770 ^ having laid the hands on him, healed him.
82776 ^ of this then having taken place,
82779 ^ also the rest
82782 ^ - in the island
82786 ^ having infirmities were coming
82789 ^ and were healed,
82791 ^ who also with many honors honored us,
82797 ^ and
82798 ^ on setting sail, they laid on [us] the things for the needs.
82804 ^ after then
82806 ^ three months, we sailed in a ship
82811 ^ having wintered in the island, alexandrian, with a figurehead of the dioscuri.
82818 ^ and
82819 ^ having put in at syracuse, we stayed days three,
82825 ^ from where
82826 ^ having gone around, we arrived at rhegium.
82830 ^ and after one day, having come on a south wind,
82836 ^ on the second day we came to puteoli,
82840 ^ where having found [some] brothers, we were entreated
82844 ^ with them to remain days seven.
82849 ^ and so to - rome we came.
82855 ^ and from there the brothers,
82858 ^ having heard the things concerning us, came out to meet us as far as of appius [the] market and [the] three taverns,
82872 ^ whom having seen - paul,
82876 ^ having given thanks to god, took courage.
82881 ^ when now we came to rome,
82886 ^ was allowed - paul
82889 ^ to stay by himself, with the
82894 ^ guarding him soldier.
82897 ^ it came to pass then,
82899 ^ after days three called together he
82904 ^ those being of the jews leaders.
82909 ^ having come together then of them,
82912 ^ he was saying to them,
82915 ^ i, men, brothers,
82918 ^ nothing against having done
82921 ^ the people or the customs - of our fathers, a prisoner from jerusalem was delivered into the hands of the romans,
82937 ^ who
82938 ^ having examined me, were wanting
82941 ^ to let [me] go,
82942 ^ on account of - not one cause of death
82947 ^ existing in me.
82950 ^ objecting however of the jews,
82954 ^ i was compelled
82955 ^ to appeal to caesar,
82957 ^ not
82958 ^ as
82959 ^ the nation of me
82962 ^ having
82963 ^ anything
82964 ^ to lay against.
82965 ^ for this therefore
82968 ^ - cause i have called
82971 ^ you, to see
82973 ^ and to speak to [you];
82975 ^ because of for
82977 ^ the hope - of israel, the chain this i have around [me].
82985 ^ - and to him they said,
82990 ^ we neither letters concerning you received from - judea,
82999 ^ nor
83000 ^ having arrived any of the brothers reported
83005 ^ or said anything concerning you evil.

83027 ^ that everywhere it is spoken against.
83030 ^ having appointed then him a day, came to him to the lodging many,
83041 ^ to whom he expounded,
83043 ^ fully testifying to the kingdom - of god,
83048 ^ persuading then them concerning - jesus from both the law of moses and the prophets, from morning to evening.
83066 ^ and some indeed were persuaded of
83070 ^ the things he is speaking;
83072 ^ some however refused to believe.
83075 ^ discordant then being with one another, they began to leave,

83086 ^ -: rightly the spirit - holy spoke by isaiah the prophet to the fathers of you,
83101 ^ saying:
83102 ^ go to the people this
83107 ^ and say,
83109 ^ in hearing you will hear
83111 ^ and no not understand;
83115 ^ and
83116 ^ in seeing you will see
83118 ^ and no not perceive.
83122 ^ has grown dull for the heart of the people this,
83129 ^ and with the ears barely they hear,
83134 ^ and the eyes of them they have closed,
83139 ^ lest ever they should see with the eyes,
83143 ^ and with the ears they should hear,
83147 ^ and with the heart they should understand,
83151 ^ and should turn,
83153 ^ and i will heal them.’
83156 ^ known therefore be it
83159 ^ to you
83160 ^ that to the gentiles has been sent this - salvation - of god;
83169 ^ they then will listen!”
83172 ^ he stayed then two years whole in his own rented house,
83179 ^ and was welcoming
83181 ^ all - coming unto him,
83186 ^ proclaiming the kingdom - of god
83191 ^ and teaching the things concerning the lord jesus christ with all boldness unhinderedly.

83226 ^ - having come of [the] seed of david according to flesh,
83233 ^ - having been declared son of god in power according to [the] spirit of holiness by resurrection [from the] dead, jesus christ, the lord of us;

83284 ^ grace to you
83286 ^ and peace from god [the] father of us and [the] lord jesus christ.
83296 ^ first indeed, i thank the god of me through jesus christ for all of you,

83369 ^ to the strengthening of you,
83373 ^ that now is,
83376 ^ to be encouraged together among you, through the among one another faith of you both and of me.
83388 ^ not i do want now you
83392 ^ to be ignorant, brothers,
83394 ^ that many times i purposed
83397 ^ to come to you,
83400 ^ and was hindered, until the present,

83470 ^ - and
83472 ^ the righteous by faith will live.”
83476 ^ is revealed for [the] wrath of god from heaven upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men,
83488 ^ - the truth by unrighteousness
83493 ^ suppressing,
83494 ^ because the known - of god manifest is among them,
83503 ^ - god for to them has revealed [it].
83508 ^ the for
83510 ^ invisible qualities of him from [the] creation of [the] world,

83531 ^ for
83532 ^ having known - god, not as god they glorified [him],

83547 ^ and was darkened the foolish of them heart.
83553 ^ professing
83554 ^ to be wise, they became fools,
83557 ^ and they changed the glory of the immortal god into a likeness of an image of mortal man and birds and quadrupeds and creeping things.
83575 ^ therefore gave up them - god in the desires of the hearts of them to impurity
83588 ^ - to dishonor the bodies of them between themselves,
83595 ^ who changed the truth - of god into the falsehood,
83604 ^ and reverenced
83606 ^ and served the created thing
83610 ^ beyond the [one] having created [it],
83613 ^ who is blessed to the ages! amen.
83620 ^ because of this gave up them - god to passions of dishonor.
83629 ^ - even for
83632 ^ females of them changed the natural use into that contrary to nature.
83642 ^ likewise then also the males,
83647 ^ having left the natural use of the female, were inflamed in the desire of them toward one another,

83666 ^ and
83667 ^ the recompense

83677 ^ and as not they did see fit
83681 ^ - god to have in [their] knowledge,
83686 ^ gave up them - god to a depraved mind,
83693 ^ to do
83694 ^ things not being proper;
83697 ^ being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness; gossips, slanderers, hateful to god, insolent, arrogant, boastful; inventors of evil things, to parents disobedient; foolish, untrustworthy, heartless, unmerciful;

84156 ^ not for the [one] on the outward a jew is;
84164 ^ neither the [one] outwardly, the outward in flesh, [is] circumcision;
84172 ^ but he who [is] on the inward a jew [is one];
84178 ^ and circumcision [is] of heart, in spirit, not in letter;
84185 ^ of whom the praise [is] not of men,
84191 ^ but of - god.
84195 ^ what then [is] the superiority of the jew?
84201 ^ or what [is] the benefit of the circumcision?
84207 ^ much in every way.
84211 ^ chiefly indeed for
84214 ^ that they were entrusted with the oracles - of god.
84220 ^ what for
84222 ^ if disbelieved some?

84243 ^ man a liar,
84245 ^ as it has been written:
84247 ^ that - you may be justified in the words of you,
84254 ^ and will prevail

84260 ^ if however the unrighteousness of us, god’s righteousness shows,
84268 ^ what shall we say?

84274 ^ - inflicting the wrath?

84281 ^ never may it be!
84283 ^ otherwise, how will judge - god the world?
84290 ^ if however the truth - of god, in - my lie, abounded to the glory of him,
84305 ^ why still also i as a sinner am judged?
84311 ^ and [is it] not,
84313 ^ as we are slanderously charged,
84315 ^ and as affirm some [that]
84319 ^ us to say
84321 ^ -, let us do things evil,
84325 ^ that may come the good things?
84329 ^ their - condemnation just is.
84334 ^ what then?
84336 ^ are we better?
84337 ^ not at all.
84339 ^ we have already charged for
84341 ^ jews both and greeks all under sin to be.
84349 ^ as it has been written
84351 ^ -: none there is righteous,
84355 ^ not even one;
84357 ^ none there is
84359 ^ - understanding;
84361 ^ none there is
84363 ^ - seeking after - god.
84367 ^ all have turned away,
84369 ^ together they have become worthless;
84371 ^ none there is
84373 ^ who is practicing good,
84376 ^ not there is so much as one.
84380 ^ a grave
84381 ^ having been opened the throat of them [is];
84385 ^ with the tongues of them they keep practicing deceit;
84389 ^ [the] venom of vipers [is] under the lips of them,
84395 ^ of whom the mouth of cursing and of bitterness is full;
84402 ^ swift [are] the feet of them
84406 ^ to shed blood;
84408 ^ ruin and misery [are] in the paths of them;
84415 ^ and [the] way of peace not they have known.
84420 ^ not there is fear of god before the eyes of them.”
84428 ^ we know now
84430 ^ that
84431 ^ whatever the law says, to those under the law it speaks,
84440 ^ so that every mouth may be stopped,
84444 ^ and under judgment may be all the world - to god.
84452 ^ therefore by works of [the] law not will be justified any flesh before him;
84462 ^ through for
84464 ^ [the] law [is] knowledge of sin.
84467 ^ now however, apart from law, [the] righteousness of god has been revealed,
84474 ^ being borne witness to by the law and the prophets,
84481 ^ [the] righteousness now
84483 ^ of god through faith from jesus christ
84488 ^ toward all those believing.
84492 ^ not for there is distinction.
84496 ^ all for have sinned
84499 ^ and fall short of the glory - of god,
84505 ^ being justified freely by the of him grace through the redemption that [is] in christ jesus,
84517 ^ whom set forth as - god a propitiation, through - faith in - his blood, for a showing forth of the righteousness of him, because of the forbearance of the
84538 ^ having taken place beforehand sins — in the forbearance - of god;
84545 ^ for of [the] showing forth the righteousness of him in the present time,
84555 ^ for - to be him just and
84561 ^ justifying the [one] of faith of jesus.
84566 ^ where then [is] the boasting?
84570 ^ it has been excluded.
84571 ^ through what principle?
84574 ^ that of works?
84576 ^ no,
84577 ^ but through [the] principle of faith.
84581 ^ we reckon therefore
84583 ^ to be justified by faith a man, apart from works of the law.
84589 ^ or of jews [is he] the god only,
84594 ^ not also of gentiles?
84597 ^ yes, also of gentiles,
84600 ^ since indeed one - god [is],
84604 ^ who will justify [the] circumcision by faith
84609 ^ and [the] uncircumcision through the [same] faith.
84614 ^ law then do we nullify through - faith?
84620 ^ never may it be!
84622 ^ instead, law we uphold.
84625 ^ what then shall we say discovered abraham, the father of us, according to [the] flesh?
84635 ^ if for abraham by works was justified,
84641 ^ he has ground of boasting,
84643 ^ but not toward god.
84647 ^ what for the scripture says?
84652 ^ believed then abraham - god,
84657 ^ and it was reckoned to him for righteousness.”
84662 ^ to the [one] now
84664 ^ working, the reward not is reckoned according to grace,
84671 ^ but according to debt.
84674 ^ to the [one] however not
84677 ^ working,
84678 ^ believing however
84680 ^ on the [one] justifying the ungodly, is reckoned the faith of him for righteousness,
84691 ^ just as also david declares the blessedness of the man
84699 ^ to whom - god credits righteousness apart from works:
84706 ^ blessed
84707 ^ [are they] of whom are forgiven
84709 ^ the lawless deeds,
84711 ^ and of whom are covered
84714 ^ the sins;
84716 ^ blessed [the] man
84718 ^ against whom no not will reckon [the] lord
84723 ^ sin.”
84724 ^ [is] the blessing then
84727 ^ this on the circumcision,
84731 ^ or also on the uncircumcision?
84736 ^ we are saying for
84738 ^ was credited - to abraham the faith as righteousness.
84745 ^ how then was it credited?
84748 ^ in circumcision being,
84751 ^ or in uncircumcision?
84754 ^ not in circumcision,
84757 ^ but in uncircumcision.
84760 ^ and [the] sign he received
84763 ^ of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith that [he had] [while] in the uncircumcision,
84773 ^ for the to be him father
84778 ^ of all those believing, in uncircumcision,
84783 ^ for - to be credited also to them the righteousness,
84790 ^ and father of circumcision to those not of circumcision only,
84798 ^ but also to those walking in the steps of the during uncircumcision faith of the father of us, abraham.
84812 ^ not for through [the] law the promise [was] - to abraham or the descendants of him
84824 ^ that heir he should be
84828 ^ [of the] world,
84829 ^ but through [the] righteousness of faith.
84833 ^ if for those of [the] law [are] heirs,
84839 ^ has been made void - faith,
84842 ^ and made of no effect the promise.
84846 ^ - for
84848 ^ law wrath brings;
84851 ^ where now no there is law, neither [is] transgression.
84858 ^ therefore it [is] of faith,
84862 ^ that [it may be] according to grace,
84865 ^ for - to be sure the promise to all the seed, not to that of the law only, but also to that of [the] faith of abraham,
84886 ^ who is [the] father of all of us —
84891 ^ as it has been written
84893 ^ -: a father of many nations i have made
84898 ^ you.”
84899 ^ before whom he believed
84902 ^ god,
84903 ^ the [one] giving life to the dead
84907 ^ and calling
84909 ^ the things not
84911 ^ [into] being
84912 ^ even existing,
84914 ^ who against hope, in hope believed,
84920 ^ for - to become him [the] father of many nations,
84927 ^ according to that having been spoken,
84930 ^ so shall be the offspring of you.”
84935 ^ and
84936 ^ not having become weak in the faith, he considered - of himself the body
84944 ^ already having become dead,
84946 ^ a hundred years old about being,
84949 ^ and the lifelessness of the womb of sarah.
84955 ^ at however
84957 ^ the promise - of god, not he did waver - through unbelief,
84965 ^ but was strengthened - in faith,
84969 ^ having given glory - to god,
84973 ^ and having been fully assured
84975 ^ that
84976 ^ what he had promised, able he is
84980 ^ also to do.
84982 ^ therefore also it was credited to him unto righteousness.”
84988 ^ not it was written now on account of him alone
84994 ^ that it was credited to him,
84997 ^ but also on account of us,
85001 ^ to whom it is about to be credited,
85004 ^ to those believing
85006 ^ on the [one] having raised jesus the lord of us out from [the] dead,
85015 ^ who was delivered over for the trespasses of us,
85021 ^ and was raised for the justification of us.
85027 ^ having been justified therefore by faith, peace we have with - god, through the lord of us jesus christ,
85042 ^ through whom also - access we have by the faith into the grace this
85054 ^ in which we stand;
85057 ^ and we boast in hope of the glory - of god.
85065 ^ not only [so] now,
85068 ^ but also we glory in - tribulations,
85074 ^ knowing
85075 ^ that - tribulation, perseverance produces;
85080 ^ - and
85082 ^ perseverance, character;
85084 ^ - and
85086 ^ character, hope.
85088 ^ - and
85090 ^ hope not does make [us] ashamed,
85093 ^ because the love - of god has been poured out into the hearts of us through [the] spirit holy,
85106 ^ the [one] having been given to us.
85109 ^ yet indeed christ,
85112 ^ being of us without strength still, according to [the] right time, for [the] ungodly died.
85121 ^ rarely indeed for a righteous [man] anyone will die;
85127 ^ on behalf of though
85129 ^ the good [man], perhaps someone even would dare
85135 ^ to die.
85136 ^ demonstrates however the of himself love to us - god,
85145 ^ that still sinners being of us,
85150 ^ christ for us died.
85154 ^ much therefore
85156 ^ more,
85157 ^ having been justified now by the blood of him, we will be saved by him from the wrath!
85169 ^ if for,
85171 ^ enemies being, we were reconciled - to god through the death of the son of him,
85182 ^ much more,
85184 ^ having been reconciled, shall we be saved in the life of him!
85190 ^ not only [so] now,
85193 ^ but also
85195 ^ we are rejoicing in - god through the lord of us jesus christ,
85205 ^ through whom now the reconciliation we have received.
85211 ^ because of this, just as through one man - sin into the world entered,
85223 ^ and through - sin, - death;
85229 ^ also thus to all men - death passed,
85237 ^ for that all sinned.
85241 ^ until for
85243 ^ [the] law, sin was in [the] world;
85248 ^ sin however not is imputed,
85252 ^ not there being law.
85255 ^ nevertheless reigned - death from adam until moses, even
85264 ^ over those not having sinned in the likeness of the transgression of adam,
85274 ^ who is a type
85277 ^ of the coming [one].
85279 ^ but [is] not like the trespass
85284 ^ so also the gift.
85288 ^ if for by the of the one trespass, the many died,
85297 ^ how much more the grace - of god and the gift in grace which [is] of the one man, jesus christ, to the many did abound!
85318 ^ and [is] not
85320 ^ as through one having sinned, the gift.
85326 ^ the truly for
85329 ^ judgment [was], of one [was] unto condemnation;
85334 ^ - but
85336 ^ the gift [is] out of many trespasses, unto justification.
85342 ^ if for, by the of the one trespass, - death reigned through the one,
85354 ^ how much more
85356 ^ those the abundance - of grace, and of the gift - of righteousness
85366 ^ receiving, in life will reign through the one, jesus christ!
85375 ^ so then, just as by one trespass, to all men [it is] unto condemnation,
85386 ^ so also by one act of righteousness, to all men [it is] unto justification of life.
85397 ^ for as for through the disobedience of the one man, sinners were made the many,
85409 ^ so also through the obedience of the one, righteous will be made the many.
85420 ^ [the] law now entered,
85423 ^ so that might abound the trespass;
85427 ^ where however abounded - sin, overabounded - grace,
85435 ^ so that just as reigned the sin in - death,
85443 ^ so also - grace might reign through righteousness, unto life eternal, through jesus christ the lord of us.
85459 ^ what then will we say?
85462 ^ shall we continue - in sin,
85465 ^ that - grace may abound?
85469 ^ never may it be!
85471 ^ who we died - to sin, how still shall we live in it?
85480 ^ or are you unaware
85482 ^ that
85483 ^ as many as have been baptized into christ jesus, into the death of him have been baptized?
85493 ^ we were buried therefore with him through - baptism into - death,
85502 ^ so that just as was raised up christ out from [the] dead by the glory of the father,
85513 ^ so also we in newness of life should walk.
85520 ^ if for united we have become
85524 ^ in the likeness of the death of him,
85529 ^ certainly also of the resurrection we will be;
85534 ^ this knowing,
85536 ^ that - old of us self was crucified with [him],
85542 ^ so that might be annulled the body - of sin,
85548 ^ [that] no longer
85550 ^ are enslaved we - to sin.
85554 ^ the [one] for
85556 ^ having died has been freed from - sin.
85561 ^ if now we died with christ,
85566 ^ we believe
85567 ^ that also we will live with him,
85571 ^ knowing
85572 ^ that christ,
85574 ^ having been raised up out from [the] dead, no more dies.
85579 ^ death him no longer rules over.
85583 ^ that which for he died, - to sin he died once for all;
85590 ^ that which however he lives, he lives - to god.
85596 ^ so also you, consider
85600 ^ yourselves to be dead indeed
85604 ^ - to sin,
85606 ^ living however - to god in christ jesus.
85613 ^ not therefore let reign - sin in the mortal of you body,
85623 ^ in order - to obey the desires of it.
85629 ^ neither yield the members of you [as] instruments of unrighteousness - to sin,
85638 ^ but yield yourselves - to god,
85643 ^ as out from [the] dead
85646 ^ living,
85647 ^ and the members of you, [as] instruments of righteousness - to god.
85655 ^ sin for you not will rule over,
85660 ^ not for you are under law,
85665 ^ but under grace.
85668 ^ what then?
85670 ^ shall we sin
85671 ^ because not we are under law,
85676 ^ but under grace?
85679 ^ never may it be!
85681 ^ not know you
85683 ^ that to whom you yield yourselves [as] slaves for obedience,
85690 ^ slaves you are
85692 ^ to him whom you obey, whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?
85702 ^ thanks [be] however - to god
85706 ^ that you used to be slaves - of sin,
85711 ^ you have become obedient now from [the] heart,
85715 ^ to which you were handed over to the form of teaching.
85720 ^ having been set free now from - sin, you have become slaves - to righteousness.
85728 ^ in human terms i speak on account of the weakness of the flesh of you.
85736 ^ for as for you yielded the members of you in bondage - to impurity and to lawlessness unto - lawlessness,
85751 ^ so now yield the members of you in bondage - to righteousness unto sanctification.
85762 ^ when for slaves you were
85766 ^ - of sin,
85768 ^ free you were
85770 ^ - from righteousness.
85772 ^ what therefore
85774 ^ fruit had you then
85777 ^ in the [things] of which now you are ashamed?
85781 ^ the for
85783 ^ end of those things [is] death.
85786 ^ now however,
85788 ^ having been set free from - sin,
85792 ^ having become slaves now - to god, you have the fruit of you unto sanctification;
85802 ^ - now
85804 ^ the end [is] life eternal.
85807 ^ the for
85809 ^ wages - of sin [is] death;
85813 ^ - but
85815 ^ the gift - of god, life eternal in christ jesus the lord of us.
85826 ^ or are you ignorant, brothers —
85829 ^ to those knowing for law i speak —
85833 ^ that the law rules over the man
85839 ^ for as long as [the] time he is alive?
85843 ^ the for
85845 ^ married woman, to the
85848 ^ living husband is bound by law;
85852 ^ if however should die the husband,
85857 ^ she is cleared from the law of the husband.
85863 ^ then therefore, being alive the husband,
85868 ^ an adulteress she will be called
85870 ^ if she is to man another;
85874 ^ if however should die the husband,
85879 ^ free she is from the law,
85884 ^ [so as for] not to be her an adulteress,
85889 ^ having been to man another.
85892 ^ likewise, brothers of me, also you have been put to death to the law through the body - of christ,
85905 ^ for - to belong you to another,
85910 ^ to the [one] out from [the] dead
85913 ^ having been raised,
85914 ^ so that we should bear fruit - to god.
85918 ^ while for we were in the flesh,
85924 ^ the passions - of sins that [were] through the law were at work in the members of us,
85937 ^ to the bringing forth of fruit - to death.
85942 ^ now however we have been released from the law,
85948 ^ having died
85949 ^ to that which we were bound,
85952 ^ in order for to serve us in newness of [the] spirit, and not in oldness
85961 ^ of [the] letter.
85962 ^ what then shall we say?
85965 ^ [is] the law sin?
85968 ^ never may it be!
85970 ^ but - sin not i have known,
85975 ^ if not by law;
85979 ^ - then for
85982 ^ covetousness, not i had been conscious of,
85985 ^ if not the law had said,
85990 ^ not you shall covet.”
85992 ^ an occasion however having taken - sin by the commandment, it produced in me all covetousness;
86005 ^ apart from for
86007 ^ [the] law, sin [is] dead.
86010 ^ i however was alive apart from law once;
86016 ^ having come however the commandment,
86020 ^ the sin revived;
86023 ^ i then died.
86026 ^ and proved to be me the commandment that [was] to life, this to death.
86037 ^ the for
86039 ^ sin,
86040 ^ an occasion having taken by the commandment, deceived me,
86047 ^ and by it put [me] to death.
86051 ^ so - indeed
86054 ^ the law [is] holy,
86056 ^ and the commandment [is] holy and righteous and good.
86064 ^ that which then
86066 ^ [is] good, to me has become death?
86070 ^ never may it be!
86072 ^ but - sin,
86075 ^ in order that it might be shown to be sin,
86078 ^ through that which [is] good to me is working out death;
86084 ^ so that might become beyond excess sinful, - sin through the commandment.
86094 ^ we know for
86096 ^ that - [the] law spiritual is;
86101 ^ i however fleshly am,
86105 ^ having been sold under - sin.
86109 ^ what for i do, not i understand;
86114 ^ not for what i want,
86118 ^ this i do;
86120 ^ but what i hate,
86123 ^ this i do.
86125 ^ if now that which not i do want,
86130 ^ this i do,
86132 ^ i consent to the law,
86135 ^ that [it is] good.
86137 ^ in that case now, no longer i am doing it,
86143 ^ but the
86145 ^ dwelling in me sin.
86149 ^ i know for
86151 ^ that nothing there dwells in me,
86156 ^ that is in the flesh of me, good;
86163 ^ - for
86165 ^ to will is present with me,
86168 ^ - but
86170 ^ to do the good, not.
86174 ^ not for
86176 ^ that i desire i do
86179 ^ good,
86180 ^ but that not i do want
86184 ^ evil,
86185 ^ this i practice.
86187 ^ if now what not i do want,
86192 ^ i this do,
86195 ^ [it is] no longer i who do it,
86199 ^ but -
86201 ^ dwelling in me sin.
86205 ^ i find so the principle, that desiring me
86212 ^ to do - good,
86215 ^ that me - evil is present with.
86220 ^ i delight for in the law - of god, according to the inward man;
86230 ^ i see however another law in the members of me,
86238 ^ warring against the law of the mind of me,
86244 ^ and making captive me to the law - of sin,
86252 ^ - being in the members of me.
86258 ^ o wretched i am
86260 ^ man!
86261 ^ who me will deliver out of the body - of death this?
86270 ^ thanks [be] then to god, through jesus christ the lord of us!
86280 ^ then so, myself i with the indeed
86286 ^ mind serve law god’s,
86290 ^ - but [with]
86292 ^ the flesh [the] law of sin.
86295 ^ [there is] no therefore now
86298 ^ condemnation to those in christ jesus.
86303 ^ - for
86305 ^ the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has set free you from the law - of sin and - of death.
86323 ^ - for
86325 ^ powerless [being] the law,
86328 ^ in that it was weak through the flesh,
86334 ^ - god,
86336 ^ - of himself son having sent, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, condemned - sin in the flesh,
86353 ^ so that the righteousness of the law should be fulfilled in us
86361 ^ - not according to the flesh
86365 ^ walking,
86366 ^ but according to [the] spirit.
86369 ^ those for according to flesh
86373 ^ being, the things of the flesh mind;
86378 ^ those however
86380 ^ according to spirit, the things of the spirit.
86385 ^ the for
86387 ^ mind of the flesh [is] death;
86391 ^ the but
86393 ^ mind of the spirit, life and peace,
86399 ^ because the mind of the flesh [is] hostility toward god;
86407 ^ to for
86409 ^ [the] law - of god not it is subject,
86414 ^ nor even for can it [be].
86417 ^ those now in flesh
86421 ^ being,
86422 ^ god to please not are able.
86426 ^ you now not are in flesh,
86432 ^ but in spirit,
86435 ^ if indeed [the] spirit of god dwells in you;
86441 ^ if however anyone [the] spirit of christ not has,
86448 ^ he not is of him.
86452 ^ if however christ [is] in you,
86457 ^ the indeed
86459 ^ body [is] dead on account of sin,
86463 ^ the however
86465 ^ spirit [is] life on account of righteousness.
86469 ^ if now the spirit
86473 ^ of the [one] having raised up - jesus out from [the] dead dwells in you,
86482 ^ the [one] having raised up christ out from [the] dead will give life also to the mortal bodies of you, on account of - dwelling his spirit in you.
86500 ^ so then, brothers, debtors we are, not to the flesh,
86508 ^ - according to flesh
86511 ^ to live.
86512 ^ if for according to flesh you live,
86517 ^ you are about
86518 ^ to die;
86519 ^ if however by [the] spirit the deeds of the body you put to death,
86527 ^ you will live.
86528 ^ as many as for by [the] spirit of god are led,
86533 ^ these sons of god. are
86537 ^ not for you have received a spirit of bondage again to fear,
86545 ^ but you have received [the] spirit of divine adoption as sons,
86549 ^ by whom we cry,
86552 ^ abba! - father!
86555 ^ himself the spirit bears witness with the spirit of us
86562 ^ that we are children of god.
86566 ^ if now children,
86569 ^ also heirs,
86571 ^ heirs indeed
86573 ^ of god,
86574 ^ joint-heirs now
86576 ^ of christ,
86577 ^ if indeed we suffer with [him],
86579 ^ so that also we may be glorified together.
86582 ^ i reckon for
86584 ^ that not comparable the sufferings of the present time [are] to the coming glory to be revealed to us.
86599 ^ the for
86601 ^ earnest expectation of the creation, the revelation of the sons - of god awaits.
86611 ^ to the for
86613 ^ futility, the creation was subjected,
86617 ^ not willingly,
86619 ^ but because of the [one] having subjected [it], in hope
86625 ^ that also itself the creation will be set free from the bondage - of decay, into the freedom of the glory of the children - of god.
86645 ^ we know for
86647 ^ that all the creation groans together
86652 ^ and travails together until - now.
86657 ^ not only [so] now,
86660 ^ but even ourselves,
86663 ^ the firstfruit of the spirit having, we also ourselves in ourselves groan,
86674 ^ divine adoption as sons awaiting,
86676 ^ the redemption of the body of us.
86681 ^ in this for
86683 ^ hope we were saved;
86685 ^ hope however
86687 ^ being seen, not is hope;
86691 ^ what for sees any does he hope for?
86696 ^ if however,
86698 ^ what not we see we hope for,
86702 ^ in patience we await.
86705 ^ likewise now also, the spirit joins to help the weakness of us;
86714 ^ the for things which we should pray for as it behooves, not we know,
86722 ^ but himself the spirit makes intercession, with groanings inexpressible.
86729 ^ the [one] now
86731 ^ searching - hearts knows
86735 ^ what [is] the mindset of the spirit,
86740 ^ because according to god, he intercedes for [the] saints.
86746 ^ we know now
86748 ^ that
86749 ^ to those loving - god, all things work together for good,
86757 ^ to those according to [his] purpose called
86761 ^ being.
86762 ^ for those whom he foreknew,
86765 ^ also he predestined [to be] conformed to the image of the son of him,
86773 ^ for - to be him firstborn among many brothers.
86781 ^ those whom then he predestined,
86784 ^ these also he called;
86787 ^ and whom he called,
86790 ^ these also he justified;
86793 ^ whom then he justified,
86796 ^ these also he glorified.
86799 ^ what then will we say to these things?
86804 ^ if - god [is] for us,
86809 ^ who [can be] against us?
86812 ^ he who indeed the own son not spared,
86819 ^ but for us all gave up him,
86825 ^ how not also with him, things all us will he grant?
86834 ^ who will bring an accusation against [the] elect of god?
86839 ^ god [is]
86840 ^ the [one] justifying.
86842 ^ who [is]
86843 ^ the [one] condemning?
86845 ^ [for it is] christ jesus,
86847 ^ the [one] having died,
86849 ^ rather now having been raised up,
86852 ^ who also is at [the] right hand - of god,
86859 ^ who and is interceding for us.
86864 ^ who us will separate from the love - of christ?
86872 ^ tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?
86885 ^ as it has been written
86887 ^ -: for the sake of you, we face death all the day;
86894 ^ we were regarded as sheep of slaughter.”
86898 ^ but in these things all, we more than conquer
86903 ^ through the [one] having loved us.
86907 ^ i am persuaded for
86909 ^ that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,
86918 ^ nor things present,
86920 ^ nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any created thing other, will be able
86933 ^ us to separate from the love - of god - in christ jesus the lord of us.
86947 ^ [the] truth i speak in christ.
86951 ^ not i am lying,
86953 ^ bearing witness with me the conscience of me in [the] spirit holy,
86961 ^ that grief to me is great,
86966 ^ and unceasing sorrow in the heart of me.
86972 ^ could wish for
86974 ^ a curse to be myself i, separated from - christ for the brothers of me, - kinsmen of me, according to [the] flesh;
86990 ^ who are israelites,
86993 ^ whose [is] the divine adoption as sons, and the glory, and the covenants, and the lawgiving, and the service, and the promises;
87011 ^ whose [are] the patriarchs;
87014 ^ and from whom [is] - christ - according to the flesh,
87022 ^ - being over all god,
87027 ^ blessed to the ages. amen.
87032 ^ [it is] not as however,
87035 ^ that has failed the word - of god.
87041 ^ not for all who [are] of israel,
87047 ^ [are] these israel.
87049 ^ nor because they are seed of abraham
87054 ^ [are] all children;
87056 ^ rather, in isaac will be named to you offspring”
87062 ^ that is, not the children of the flesh,
87069 ^ these [are] children - of god;
87073 ^ but the children of the promise are regarded as offspring.
87081 ^ of [the] promise for,
87083 ^ the word [is] this:
87086 ^ at the time this, i will come,
87091 ^ and there will be - to sarah a son.”
87096 ^ not only then,
87099 ^ but also rebecca,
87102 ^ by one conception, having
87106 ^ isaac the father of us,
87110 ^ not yet for having been born,
87113 ^ nor having done anything good or evil,
87119 ^ so that the according to election purpose - of god might stand, not of works,
87130 ^ but of the [one] calling,
87134 ^ it was said to her
87136 ^ -, the older will serve the younger.”
87142 ^ as it has been written
87144 ^ -: jacob i loved,
87147 ^ - but
87149 ^ esau i hated.”
87151 ^ what then shall we say?
87154 ^ not injustice with - god [is there]?
87159 ^ never may it be!
87161 ^ to moses for he says:
87165 ^ i will show mercy to
87166 ^ whom - i may show mercy,
87169 ^ and i will have compassion on
87171 ^ whom - i may have compassion.”
87174 ^ so then, [it is] not
87177 ^ of the willing,
87179 ^ nor of the running, but -
87184 ^ showing mercy of god.
87186 ^ says for the scripture to pharaoh
87192 ^ -: for this very therefore i have raised up you,
87198 ^ so that i might show in you the power of me,
87205 ^ and that should be declared the name of me in all the earth.”
87215 ^ so then,
87217 ^ to whom he wants, he shows mercy;
87220 ^ whom now he wants, he hardens.
87224 ^ you will say to me then,
87227 ^ why then still does he find fault?
87231 ^ the for
87233 ^ purpose of him, who is resisting?
87237 ^ o man, but rather, you who are
87243 ^ - answering against - god?
87247 ^ not will say the thing formed
87251 ^ to the [one] having formed [it],
87253 ^ why me have you made like this?”
87257 ^ or not has authority the potter
87263 ^ over the clay,
87265 ^ out of the same lump to make
87270 ^ one indeed unto honor vessel,
87275 ^ one however unto dishonor?
87279 ^ what if now
87281 ^ desiring - god
87284 ^ to show the wrath
87287 ^ and to make known the power of him, bore with much patience, [the] vessels of wrath,
87298 ^ having been fitted for destruction,
87301 ^ also that he might make known the riches of the glory of him upon [the] vessels of mercy,
87312 ^ which he prepared beforehand for glory,
87316 ^ whom even he has called,
87319 ^ us not only out from [the] jews, but also out from [the] gentiles?
87328 ^ as also in - hosea he says:
87334 ^ i will call that which [is] not people
87338 ^ of me, people of me;
87341 ^ and
87342 ^ her not having been loved,
87345 ^ having been loved,”
87346 ^ and, it will happen that in the place
87351 ^ where it was said to them,
87354 ^ not people my [are] you,
87358 ^ there they will be called sons of god
87362 ^ [the] living.’”
87363 ^ isaiah also cries out concerning - israel:
87369 ^ though shall be the number of the sons of israel as the sand of the sea,
87381 ^ [only] the remnant will be saved.
87384 ^ [the] sentence for
87386 ^ concluding
87387 ^ and bringing swiftly, will perform [the] lord upon the earth.”
87394 ^ and, as foretold isaiah:
87398 ^ if not [the] lord of hosts had left us descendants,
87405 ^ like sodom - we would have become,
87409 ^ and like gomorrah - we would have been made.”
87414 ^ what then will we say?
87417 ^ that gentiles
87419 ^ - not pursuing righteousness, have attained righteousness,
87425 ^ righteousness now
87427 ^ that [is] by faith;
87430 ^ israel however,
87432 ^ pursuing a law of righteousness, to [that] law not did attain.
87439 ^ because of why?
87441 ^ because [it was] not by faith,
87445 ^ but as by works.
87449 ^ they stumbled over the stone - of stumbling,
87454 ^ as it has been written:
87456 ^ behold
87457 ^ i lay in zion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense;
87465 ^ and
87466 ^ the [one] believing on him, never will be put to shame.”
87472 ^ brothers, the indeed
87475 ^ desire - of my heart and the supplication to - god on behalf of them [is] for salvation.
87489 ^ i bear witness for about them,
87492 ^ that zeal for god they have,
87496 ^ but not according to knowledge.
87500 ^ being ignorant of for the - of god righteousness,
87506 ^ and
87507 ^ the own righteousness seeking to establish, to the righteousness - of god, not they submitted.
87518 ^ [the] end for
87520 ^ of law [is] christ, unto righteousness
87524 ^ to everyone - believing.
87527 ^ moses for writes [of] the righteousness that [is] of the law,
87536 ^ that the
87538 ^ having done these things man, will live by them.”
87544 ^ the however
87546 ^ of faith righteousness, thus speaks:
87551 ^ not you should say in the heart of you,
87557 ^ who will ascend into - heaven?’
87562 ^ that is,
87564 ^ christ to bring down,
87566 ^ or, who will descend into the abyss?’
87572 ^ that is,
87574 ^ christ out from [the] dead to bring up.
87578 ^ but what says it?
87581 ^ near you the word is, in the mouth of you and in the heart of you.”
87595 ^ that is, the word - of faith
87601 ^ which we proclaim,
87603 ^ that if you confess with the mouth of you, [the] lord [is] jesus,
87612 ^ and believe in the heart of you,
87618 ^ that - god him raised out from [the] dead,
87625 ^ you will be saved.
87626 ^ in the heart for is belief unto righteousness;
87631 ^ in the mouth now is confession unto salvation.
87636 ^ says for the scripture,
87640 ^ everyone - believing on him not will be put to shame.”
87647 ^ not for there is difference jew between and greek;
87655 ^ - for
87657 ^ the same lord of all
87660 ^ is rich
87661 ^ toward all those calling him.
87666 ^ whoever for
87668 ^ that - shall call upon the name of [the] lord will be saved.”
87675 ^ how then shall they call
87678 ^ on [him] whom not they believed?
87682 ^ how now shall they believe on [him]
87685 ^ of whom not they have heard?
87688 ^ how now shall they hear
87691 ^ apart from preaching?
87693 ^ how now shall they preach
87696 ^ if not they are sent?
87699 ^ as it has been written:
87701 ^ how beautiful the feet
87705 ^ of those proclaiming good news of good things!”
87709 ^ but not all heeded the good news.
87715 ^ isaiah for says,
87718 ^ lord, who has believed the report of us?”
87724 ^ so - faith [is] from hearing,
87729 ^ - and
87731 ^ hearing through [the] word of christ.
87735 ^ but i ask,
87737 ^ no not did they hear?
87740 ^ indeed: into all the earth has gone out the voice of them;
87749 ^ and to the ends of the world, the words of them.”
87758 ^ but i ask,
87760 ^ not israel not did know?
87764 ^ first, moses says:
87767 ^ i will provoke to jealousy you by [those] not a nation;
87773 ^ by a nation without understanding, i will anger you.”
87778 ^ isaiah then is very bold
87781 ^ and says:
87783 ^ i was found
87784 ^ by those me
87787 ^ not seeking;
87789 ^ manifest i became
87791 ^ to those me
87793 ^ not inquiring after.”
87795 ^ as for however,
87797 ^ - israel, he says:
87800 ^ all the day, i have stretched out the hands of me, to a people
87809 ^ disobeying
87810 ^ and contradicting.”
87812 ^ i ask then,
87814 ^ not did reject - god the people of him?
87821 ^ never may it be!
87823 ^ also for i an israelite am, of [the] seed of abraham, of [the] tribe of benjamin.
87833 ^ not did reject - god the people of him,
87840 ^ whom he foreknew.
87842 ^ or not know you
87845 ^ in elijah what says the scripture,
87851 ^ how he pleads - with god against - israel:
87858 ^ lord, the prophets of you they have killed;
87863 ^ the altars of you they have torn down;
87867 ^ and i have been left alone,
87870 ^ and they are seeking the life of me.”
87875 ^ but what [was] spoken to him the divine answer?
87881 ^ i have left to myself seven thousand men
87885 ^ who not have bowed [the] knee - to baal.”
87891 ^ thus then also, in the present time, a remnant according to [the] election of grace there has been.
87903 ^ if now by grace,
87906 ^ no longer from works;
87909 ^ otherwise - grace no longer would be grace.
87915 ^ what then?
87917 ^ what is seeking israel,
87920 ^ this not it has obtained;
87923 ^ - but
87925 ^ the elect obtained [it].
87927 ^ the now
87929 ^ rest were hardened,
87931 ^ as it has been written:
87933 ^ gave them - god a spirit of stupor, eyes
87940 ^ - not to see, and ears
87945 ^ - not to hear, unto the today day.”
87952 ^ and david says:
87955 ^ let be the table of them for a snare and for a trap, and for a stumbling block and for a retribution to them;
87971 ^ let be darkened the eyes of them,
87975 ^ - not to see,
87978 ^ and the backs of them, for ever bent over.”
87985 ^ i ask then,
87987 ^ not did they stumble
87989 ^ that they might fall?
87991 ^ never may it be!
87993 ^ but in the of them trespass - [is] salvation to the gentiles,
88001 ^ so as - to provoke to jealousy them.
88005 ^ if however, the trespass of them [is] riches of [the] world,
88012 ^ and the failure of them [is the] riches of [the] gentiles,
88018 ^ how much more the fullness of them!
88023 ^ to you now i am speaking,
88026 ^ the gentiles.
88028 ^ upon as much as indeed therefore am i of [the] gentiles apostle,
88036 ^ the ministry of me i magnify,
88040 ^ if at all i shall provoke to jealousy of me the flesh,
88046 ^ and shall save some of them.
88051 ^ if for the rejection of them [is the] reconciliation of [the] world,
88058 ^ what [will be] the acceptance,
88061 ^ if not life out from [the] dead?
88066 ^ if now the firstfruit [is] holy,
88071 ^ also the lump;
88074 ^ and if the root [is] holy,
88079 ^ also the branches.
88082 ^ if however some of the branches were broken off,
88088 ^ you now,
88090 ^ a wild olive tree being, were grafted in among them,
88095 ^ and a fellow-partaker of the root of the fatness of the olive tree have become,
88104 ^ not boast over the branches.
88108 ^ if now you boast against [them],
88111 ^ not you the root support,
88116 ^ but the root you.
88120 ^ you will say then,
88122 ^ were broken off branches,
88124 ^ that i might be grafted in.
88127 ^ rightly so;
88128 ^ by the unbelief they were broken off;
88131 ^ you however - by faith stand.
88136 ^ not high be minded,
88139 ^ but be afraid.
88141 ^ if for - god the according to nature branches not spared,
88151 ^ not at all neither you will he spare.
88156 ^ behold therefore [the] kindness and severity of god;
88162 ^ upon indeed
88164 ^ those having fallen, severity;
88167 ^ toward however
88169 ^ you, kindness of god,
88172 ^ if you continue in the kindness;
88176 ^ otherwise also you will be cut off.
88180 ^ even they now
88182 ^ if not they continue - in unbelief, will be grafted in;
88188 ^ able for is - god
88193 ^ again to graft in them.
88196 ^ if for you, out of the according to nature were cut off
88204 ^ a wild olive tree,
88205 ^ and, contrary to nature, were grafted into a cultivated olive tree,
88211 ^ how much more these, who according to nature [are], will be grafted into the own olive tree!
88221 ^ not for i want you
88225 ^ to be ignorant, brothers, of the mystery this,
88230 ^ that not you may be in yourselves wise,
88236 ^ that a hardening in part - to israel has happened,
88243 ^ until that the fullness of the gentiles may come in;
88250 ^ and so all israel will be saved,
88255 ^ as it has been written:
88257 ^ will come out of zion
88260 ^ the [one] delivering,
88262 ^ he will remove ungodliness from jacob.
88266 ^ and this [is] to them the from me covenant,
88273 ^ when i shall take away the sins of them.”
88278 ^ as regards indeed
88280 ^ the gospel, [they are] enemies on account of you;
88285 ^ as regards however
88287 ^ the election, beloved on account of the patriarchs.
88293 ^ irrevocable for [are] the gifts and the calling - of god.
88302 ^ just as for you once were disobedient - to god,
88309 ^ now however have been shown mercy the of these disobedience,
88315 ^ so also these now have been disobedient, the for your mercy,
88323 ^ so that also they now may have mercy shown [them].
88328 ^ has bound up for - god - all in disobedience,
88336 ^ that - all he may show mercy to.
88340 ^ o, [the] depth of riches, both of wisdom and knowledge of god!
88348 ^ how unsearchable the judgments of him,
88353 ^ and untraceable the ways of him!
88358 ^ who for has known [the] mind of [the] lord,
88363 ^ or who counselor of him has been?”
88368 ^ or who has first given to him,
88372 ^ and it will be recompensed to him?”
88375 ^ for from him, and through him, and unto him - [are] all things.
88386 ^ to him [be] the glory to the ages! amen.
88393 ^ i exhort therefore you, brothers,
88397 ^ through the compassions - of god, to present the bodies of you a sacrifice
88407 ^ living, holy, well-pleasing, - to god which is [the] reasonable service of you.
88416 ^ and not be conformed to the age this,
88422 ^ but be transformed by the renewing of the mind,
88428 ^ for - to prove by you,
88432 ^ what [is] the will - of god, - good and well-pleasing and perfect.
88443 ^ i say for through the grace
88448 ^ - having been given to me
88451 ^ to everyone - being among you,
88456 ^ not to be high-minded
88458 ^ above what it behooves [you] to think,
88462 ^ but to think
88464 ^ so as - to be sober-minded,
88467 ^ to each as - god has allotted a measure of faith.
88474 ^ just as for, in one body many members we have,
88482 ^ - now
88484 ^ the members all not the same have
88490 ^ function;
88491 ^ so the many, one body we are in christ;
88499 ^ - and
88501 ^ individually one of another members.
88505 ^ we are having however gifts according to the grace
88511 ^ - having been given to us
88514 ^ different:
88515 ^ if
88516 ^ prophecy, according to the proportion of the faith;
88522 ^ or
88523 ^ service, in the service;
88527 ^ or
88528 ^ - teaching, in the teaching;
88533 ^ or
88534 ^ - exhorting, in the exhortation;
88539 ^ - giving, in generosity;
88543 ^ - leading, with diligence;
88547 ^ - showing mercy, with cheerfulness.
88551 ^ [let] love [be] unfeigned:
88554 ^ abhorring - evil,
88557 ^ cleaving to - good, - in brotherly love to one another devoted
88565 ^ - in honor, one another esteeming,
88569 ^ - in diligence not lagging,
88573 ^ - in spirit being fervent,
88576 ^ the lord serving,
88579 ^ - in hope rejoicing,
88582 ^ - in tribulation being patient,
88585 ^ - in prayer being constant,
88588 ^ to the needs of the saints contributing,
88593 ^ - hospitality pursuing.
88596 ^ bless
88597 ^ those persecuting you.
88600 ^ bless
88601 ^ and not curse;
88604 ^ to rejoice
88605 ^ with the rejoicing,
88607 ^ to weep
88608 ^ with the weeping;
88610 ^ the same thing toward one another minding,
88615 ^ not the things haughty minding,
88619 ^ but
88620 ^ with the lowly going along.
88623 ^ not be wise in yourselves.
88628 ^ to no one evil for evil repaying,
88633 ^ providing right before all men;
88638 ^ if possible - of you,
88643 ^ with all men living at peace;
88647 ^ never yourselves avenging, beloved;
88651 ^ instead give place - to wrath;
88656 ^ it has been written for:
88658 ^ mine [is] vengeance,
88660 ^ i will repay,
88662 ^ says [the] lord.”
88664 ^ on the contrary, if should hunger the enemy of you,
88670 ^ feed him;
88672 ^ if he should thirst,
88674 ^ give drink him;
88676 ^ this for doing, coals of fire you will heap upon the head of him.”
88686 ^ not be overcome by - evil,
88691 ^ but overcome with - good - evil.
88698 ^ every soul to the authorities
88701 ^ being above [him] let be subject.
88703 ^ not for there is authority,
88707 ^ if not by god;
88711 ^ those however
88713 ^ existing,
88714 ^ by god having been instituted are.
88718 ^ therefore
88719 ^ the [one] resisting the authority, the - of god ordinance has resisted;
88728 ^ those now
88730 ^ having resisted upon themselves judgment will bring.
88734 ^ the for
88736 ^ rulers not are a terror - to good works,
88743 ^ but - to evil.
88746 ^ do you desire now
88748 ^ not to fear the authority?
88752 ^ the good do,
88755 ^ and you will have praise from him.
88760 ^ of god for
88762 ^ servant he is to you for - good.
88768 ^ if however - evil you do,
88773 ^ be afraid,
88774 ^ not for in vain the sword he bears;
88780 ^ of god for
88782 ^ a servant he is,
88784 ^ an avenger for wrath
88787 ^ to the [one] - evil
88790 ^ doing.
88791 ^ therefore necessary [it is]
88793 ^ to be subject, not only on account of the wrath,
88799 ^ but also on account of the conscience.
88804 ^ because of this for, also taxes pay you;
88810 ^ servants for
88812 ^ of god they are,
88814 ^ upon this very thing attending continually.
88818 ^ render to all their dues,
88822 ^ to whom the tax, the tax;
88827 ^ to whom the revenue, the revenue;
88832 ^ to whom the respect, the respect;
88837 ^ to whom the honor, the honor.
88842 ^ to no one nothing owe,
88845 ^ if not
88847 ^ - one another to love;
88850 ^ the [one] for
88852 ^ loving the other, [the] law has fulfilled.
88857 ^ - for,
88859 ^ not you shall commit adultery,
88861 ^ not you shall murder,
88863 ^ not you shall steal,
88865 ^ not you shall covet,” and if any other commandment, in the word this it is summed up,
88877 ^ in the [saying]: you shall love the neighbor of you as yourself.”
88885 ^ - love to the neighbor evil not does do;
88892 ^ [the] fulfillment therefore
88894 ^ of [the] law - love [is].
88897 ^ and this, knowing
88900 ^ the time,
88902 ^ that [it is the] hour already
88905 ^ for you out of sleep to awaken;
88909 ^ now for nearer [is] of us the salvation
88915 ^ than when first we believed.
88918 ^ the night is nearly over,
88921 ^ - and
88923 ^ the day has drawn near.
88925 ^ we should cast off therefore the works - of darkness;
88931 ^ we should put on now the armor - of light.
88937 ^ as in daytime, properly we should walk,
88942 ^ not in reveling and drinking,
88946 ^ not in sexual immorality and sensuality,
88950 ^ not in dissension and jealousy.
88954 ^ but put on the lord jesus christ,
88960 ^ and of the flesh provision not make for desires.
88968 ^ the [one] now
88970 ^ being weak in the faith, receive,
88974 ^ not for passing judgment on reasonings.
88978 ^ one indeed believes
88981 ^ to eat all things;
88983 ^ the [one] however
88985 ^ being weak, vegetables eats.
88988 ^ the [one] eating,
88990 ^ the [one] not eating not let him despise;
88995 ^ the [one] now
88997 ^ not eating,
88999 ^ him eating not let him judge,
89003 ^ - god for him has received.
89008 ^ you who are,
89011 ^ - judging another’s servant?
89015 ^ to the own master he stands
89019 ^ or falls.
89021 ^ he will be upheld however;
89023 ^ able is for the lord
89027 ^ to uphold him.
89029 ^ one truly for judges a day [to be] above [another] day;
89036 ^ one however judges every day [alike].
89041 ^ each in the own mind, let be fully assured.
89047 ^ the [one] regarding the day, to [the] lord regards [it];
89053 ^ and
89054 ^ the [one] eating, to [the] lord eats,
89058 ^ he gives thanks for - to god;
89062 ^ and
89063 ^ the [one] not eating, to [the] lord not he eats,
89069 ^ and he gives thanks - to god.
89073 ^ no one for
89075 ^ of us to himself lives,
89078 ^ and no one to himself dies.
89082 ^ if both for we should live,
89086 ^ to the lord we live;
89089 ^ if also we should die,
89092 ^ to the lord we die.
89095 ^ if both therefore we should live,
89099 ^ if also we should die,
89102 ^ the lord’s we are.
89105 ^ unto this for, christ died
89110 ^ and lived again,
89112 ^ that both [the] dead and
89116 ^ living he might rule over.
89118 ^ you however, why judge you the brother or you,
89125 ^ or also you why do despise the brother of you?
89133 ^ all for we will stand before the judgment seat of god.
89140 ^ it has been written for:
89142 ^ live i,
89144 ^ says [the] lord,
89146 ^ that to me will bow every knee,
89151 ^ and every tongue will confess - to god.”
89157 ^ so then, each of us concerning himself, account will give - to god.
89167 ^ no longer therefore one another should we judge;
89171 ^ but this determine rather,
89175 ^ - not to put [any] stumbling block before [your] brother,
89181 ^ or snare.
89183 ^ i know
89184 ^ and i am persuaded in [the] lord jesus
89189 ^ that nothing [is] unclean of itself;
89194 ^ if not
89196 ^ to him reckoning
89198 ^ anything unclean to be,
89201 ^ to that one unclean [it is].
89203 ^ if for on account of food, the brother of you is grieved,
89211 ^ no longer according to love are you walking.
89215 ^ not with the food of you that one destroy,
89221 ^ for whom christ died.
89225 ^ not let be spoken of as evil, therefore, your - good.
89231 ^ not for is the kingdom - of god eating and drinking,
89241 ^ but righteousness and peace and joy in [the] spirit holy.
89250 ^ the [one] for in these things
89254 ^ serving - christ [is] well-pleasing - to god and approved - by men.
89264 ^ so then, the things - of peace we should pursue,
89270 ^ and the things - for edification - among each other.
89277 ^ not for the sake of food, destroy the work - of god.
89285 ^ all things indeed [are] clean,
89288 ^ but [it is] wrong to the man
89292 ^ - through a stumbling block
89295 ^ eating.
89296 ^ [it is] good
89297 ^ - neither to eat meat,
89301 ^ nor to drink wine,
89304 ^ nor [anything]
89305 ^ in which the brother of you stumbles.
89311 ^ you [the] faith
89313 ^ that have, to yourself keep before - god.
89321 ^ blessed [is]
89322 ^ the [one] not judging himself
89326 ^ in what he approves.
89329 ^ the [one] however
89331 ^ doubting,
89332 ^ if he eats, has been condemned,
89335 ^ because [it is] not of faith;
89339 ^ everything now
89341 ^ that [is] not of faith, sin is.
89347 ^ we ought now, we who [are] strong,
89352 ^ the weaknesses of the weak to bear,
89357 ^ and not ourselves to please.
89361 ^ each of us the neighbor let please, unto the good, for edification.
89371 ^ even for - christ not himself pleased,
89378 ^ but as it has been written:
89381 ^ the reproaches
89383 ^ of those reproaching you have fallen on me.”
89389 ^ whatever for was written in the past, for - our instruction was written,
89397 ^ so that through - endurance and through the encouragement of the scriptures, - hope we might have.
89410 ^ the now
89412 ^ god - of endurance and - encouragement, may he give you
89420 ^ the same to be of mind with one another, according to christ jesus,
89428 ^ so that with one accord, with one mouth, you may glorify the god and father of the lord of us jesus christ.
89443 ^ therefore receive one another
89446 ^ as also - christ received you, to [the] glory - of god.
89456 ^ i say for,
89458 ^ christ a servant to have become
89461 ^ of [the] circumcision for [the] truth of god,
89465 ^ in order - to confirm the promises given to the fathers,
89472 ^ - and [for]
89474 ^ the gentiles, for mercy, to glorify - god,
89480 ^ as it has been written:
89482 ^ because of this i will praise you among [the] gentiles,
89488 ^ and to the name of you will i sing.”
89493 ^ and again it says:
89496 ^ rejoice you gentiles, with the people of him.”
89502 ^ and again:
89504 ^ praise all the gentiles, the lord;
89510 ^ and praise him, all the peoples.”
89516 ^ and again, isaiah says:
89520 ^ there will be the root - of jesse, and
89526 ^ the [one] arising
89528 ^ to rule over gentiles;
89530 ^ in him [the] gentiles will hope.”
89534 ^ - and
89536 ^ the god - of hope may fill you with all joy and peace,
89545 ^ in - believing;
89548 ^ for - to abound you in - hope in [the] power [of the] spirit holy.
89559 ^ i am persuaded now, brothers of me, also myself i concerning you,
89568 ^ that also you yourselves full are
89573 ^ of goodness,
89574 ^ being filled with all - knowledge,
89578 ^ being able also
89580 ^ one another to admonish.
89582 ^ more boldly however i have written to you, in part,
89588 ^ as reminding you, because of the grace
89594 ^ - having been given to me by - god
89600 ^ for - to be me a minister christ of jesus to the gentiles,
89610 ^ administering the sacred service of the gospel - of god,
89615 ^ so that might become the offering of the gentiles acceptable,
89622 ^ having been sanctified in [the] spirit holy.
89626 ^ i have therefore the boasting in christ jesus, in the things pertaining to - god.
89637 ^ not for will i dare
89640 ^ anything to speak of,
89642 ^ what except has accomplished christ through me, unto [the] obedience of [the] gentiles, by word and deed, in [the] power of signs and wonders, in [the] power of [the] spirit of god;
89663 ^ so as for me from jerusalem, and around unto - illyricum, to have fully proclaimed the gospel - of christ,
89677 ^ thus now being ambitious
89680 ^ to preach the gospel
89681 ^ not where had been named christ,
89685 ^ so that not upon another’s foundation i might build.
89691 ^ rather, as it has been written:
89694 ^ to whom not it was proclaimed concerning him; they will see,
89700 ^ and
89701 ^ those that not have heard will understand.”
89705 ^ therefore also i have been hindered - many [times]
89710 ^ - to come to you.
89714 ^ now however, no longer a place having in the regions these,
89723 ^ a great desire now having had
89726 ^ - to come to you for many years,
89733 ^ whenever - i may go to - spain
89739 ^ i hope for
89741 ^ going through
89742 ^ to see you,
89744 ^ and by you to be equipped there,
89749 ^ if of you first in part i should be filled.
89755 ^ now however i am going to jerusalem,
89760 ^ ministering to the saints.
89763 ^ were pleased for macedonia and achaia
89768 ^ a contribution certain to make for the poor among the saints - in jerusalem.
89779 ^ they were pleased for,
89781 ^ and debtors they are
89784 ^ of them.
89785 ^ if for the things spiritual of them have shared in the gentiles,
89793 ^ they ought also
89795 ^ in the material things to minister to them.
89800 ^ this therefore having finished
89803 ^ and having sealed to them the fruit this, i will set off through you into spain.
89814 ^ i know now
89816 ^ that
89817 ^ coming to you, in [the] fullness of the blessing of christ i will come.
89825 ^ i exhort now you, brothers, by the lord of us jesus christ and by the love of the spirit,
89841 ^ to strive together with me in the prayers for me to - god,
89851 ^ so that i may be delivered
89853 ^ from those refusing to be persuaded in - judea,
89859 ^ and the service of me, which [is] in jerusalem, acceptable to the saints may be,
89870 ^ so that
89871 ^ in joy, having come to you by [the] will of god, i may be refreshed with you.
89881 ^ - and
89883 ^ the god - of peace [be] with all of you. amen.
89890 ^ i commend now to you phoebe, the sister of us,
89897 ^ being also a servant of the church - in cenchrea,
89905 ^ that her you might receive in [the] lord worthily - of the saints,
89913 ^ and you might assist her
89916 ^ in whatever - of you she may need
89921 ^ matter.
89922 ^ also for she a patroness of many has been,
89928 ^ and of me myself.

90307 ^ which [is], [be] the glory to the ages amen.
90314 ^ paul, a called apostle of christ jesus by [the] will of god, and sosthenes, the brother, to the church - of god
90330 ^ - being in corinth,
90334 ^ having been sanctified in christ jesus, called holy,
90340 ^ together with all those calling on the name of the lord of us jesus christ in every place, both theirs and ours:
90357 ^ grace to you

90381 ^ - having been given you in christ jesus,
90387 ^ that in everything you have been enriched in him, in all speech and all knowledge,
90399 ^ as the testimony about christ was confirmed in you,
90407 ^ so as for you not to be lacking in not one gift,
90414 ^ eagerly awaiting the revelation of the lord of us jesus christ,
90422 ^ who also will sustain you to [the] end,

90453 ^ i exhort now you, brothers, by the name of the lord of us jesus christ,
90465 ^ that the same thing you speak all,
90470 ^ and not there be among you divisions;
90476 ^ you may be however
90478 ^ having been knit together in the same mind and in the same judgment.
90488 ^ it was shown for to me concerning you, brothers of me, by those of chloe,
90498 ^ that quarrels among you there are.
90503 ^ i mean now this,
90506 ^ that each of you says,
90510 ^ i indeed am of paul,
90514 ^ i and of apollos,
90517 ^ i and of cephas,”
90520 ^ i and of christ.
90523 ^ has been divided - christ?
90526 ^ not paul was crucified for you?
90531 ^ or into the name of paul were you baptized?
90537 ^ i thank - god
90540 ^ that no one of you i baptized,
90544 ^ if not crispus and gaius,
90549 ^ so that not anyone should say
90553 ^ that into - my name you were baptized.
90559 ^ i baptized now also the of stephanas household;
90565 ^ as to the rest, not i know
90568 ^ whether any other i baptized.
90572 ^ not for sent me christ
90577 ^ to baptize,
90578 ^ but to preach the gospel,
90580 ^ not in wisdom of discourse,
90584 ^ that not be emptied of power the cross of the christ.
90591 ^ the message for
90594 ^ - of the cross,
90597 ^ to those indeed
90599 ^ perishing foolishness is;
90602 ^ those however
90604 ^ being saved, to us, power of god it is.
90609 ^ it has been written for:
90611 ^ i will destroy the wisdom of the wise,
90616 ^ and the intelligence of the intelligent i will frustrate.”
90622 ^ where [is the] wise?
90624 ^ where [the] scribe?
90626 ^ where [the] debater the age of this?
90631 ^ not has made foolish - god the wisdom of the world?
90639 ^ since for in the wisdom - of god, not knew the world through the wisdom - god,
90655 ^ was pleased - god,
90658 ^ through the foolishness of the proclamation, to save
90664 ^ those believing.
90666 ^ seeing that both jews signs ask for,
90671 ^ and greeks wisdom seek,
90675 ^ we however preach christ
90679 ^ having been crucified,
90680 ^ to [the] jewish indeed a stumbling block,
90683 ^ to gentiles now foolishness;
90686 ^ to them however
90688 ^ the called, jews both and greeks, christ of god [the] power and of god [the] wisdom.
90700 ^ for the foolishness - of god wiser - than men is,
90709 ^ and the weakness - of god stronger - than men.
90717 ^ consider for the calling of you, brothers,
90723 ^ that not many wise according to flesh [were],
90729 ^ not many powerful,
90732 ^ not many of noble birth.
90735 ^ but the foolish things of the world has chosen - god
90743 ^ that he might shame the wise;
90747 ^ and the weak things of the world chose - god
90755 ^ that he might shame the strong;
90759 ^ and the low-born of the world, and
90765 ^ the things being despised, chose - god,
90770 ^ [also] the things not
90772 ^ being,
90773 ^ that
90774 ^ the things being he might annul,
90777 ^ so that not might boast all flesh before - god.
90785 ^ out of him however, you are in christ jesus,
90793 ^ who has been made wisdom unto us from god, righteousness and also sanctification and redemption,
90805 ^ in order that, as it has been written:
90808 ^ the [one] boasting, in [the] lord let him boast.”
90813 ^ and i,
90814 ^ having come to you, brothers, came not according to excellency of speech, or wisdom,
90825 ^ proclaiming to you the mystery - of god.
90831 ^ nothing for i decided
90834 ^ anything to know among you,
90838 ^ if not jesus christ, and him
90844 ^ having been crucified.
90845 ^ and i, in weakness, and in fear, and in trembling much, was with you.
90858 ^ and the message of me and the preaching of me [were] not in persuasive of wisdom words,
90871 ^ but in demonstration of [the] spirit and of power,
90877 ^ so that the faith of you not might be in wisdom of men,
90886 ^ but in power of god.
90890 ^ wisdom however we speak among the mature;
90896 ^ wisdom however,
90898 ^ not the age of this, nor of the rulers the age of this,
90908 ^ who are coming to naught.
90910 ^ but we speak of god wisdom in a mystery,
90916 ^ - having been hidden,
90918 ^ which foreordained - god before the ages for glory of us,
90928 ^ which none of the rulers the age of this has understood;
90936 ^ if for they had understood [it],
90939 ^ not - the lord - of glory they would have crucified,
90946 ^ but as it has been written:
90949 ^ what eye not has seen,
90953 ^ and ear not has heard,
90957 ^ and into heart of man not has entered,
90963 ^ what has prepared - god
90967 ^ for those loving him.”
90970 ^ to us for has revealed [it] - god through the spirit.
90978 ^ the for
90980 ^ spirit all things searches,
90983 ^ even the depths - of god.
90988 ^ who for knows
90991 ^ among men the things of the man,
90995 ^ if not the spirit of the man that [is] within him?
91004 ^ so also the things - of god no one knows,
91011 ^ if not the spirit - of god.
91017 ^ we now, not the spirit of the world have received,
91025 ^ but the spirit who [is] from - god,
91032 ^ that we may know
91034 ^ the things by - god
91038 ^ having been granted to us,
91040 ^ which also we speak, not in taught of human wisdom words,
91049 ^ but in [those] taught of [the] spirit,
91053 ^ by spiritual [means] spiritual things communicating.
91056 ^ [the] natural however
91058 ^ man not accepts the things of the spirit - of god;
91066 ^ foolishness for to him they are,
91070 ^ and not he is able
91073 ^ to understand [them],
91074 ^ because spiritually they are discerned.
91077 ^ he who [is] however
91079 ^ spiritual judges - all things
91083 ^ he himself, however by no one is judged.
91088 ^ who for has known [the] mind of [the] lord?
91093 ^ who will instruct him?”
91096 ^ we however [the] mind of christ have.
91101 ^ and i brothers not was able
91105 ^ to speak to you as to spiritual,
91109 ^ but as to fleshly, as to infants in christ.
91116 ^ milk you i gave to drink,
91119 ^ not solid food,
91121 ^ not yet for were you able.
91124 ^ in fact, not still now are you able;
91129 ^ still for fleshly you are.
91133 ^ where for [are] among you jealousy and strife,
91140 ^ not fleshly are you,
91143 ^ and according to man are walking?
91147 ^ when for might say one,
91151 ^ i indeed am of paul,
91155 ^ another however,
91157 ^ i of apollos,
91159 ^ not fleshly are you?
91162 ^ who then is apollos?
91166 ^ who now is paul?
91170 ^ servants
91171 ^ through whom you believed,
91174 ^ also to each as the lord has given?
91180 ^ i planted,
91182 ^ apollos watered,
91184 ^ but - god kept [it] growing.
91188 ^ so neither
91190 ^ the [one] planting is anything,
91194 ^ nor the [one] watering,
91197 ^ but [only] the [one]
91199 ^ giving growth — god.
91201 ^ the [one] planting now
91204 ^ and the [one] watering, one are;
91209 ^ each now the own reward will receive, according to the own labor.
91219 ^ of god for we are
91222 ^ fellow workers;
91223 ^ god’s field, god’s building you are.
91228 ^ according to the grace - of god
91233 ^ - having been given to me, as a wise master builder [the] foundation i have laid;
91241 ^ another however is building upon [it].
91244 ^ each one however let take heed
91247 ^ how he builds upon [it].
91249 ^ foundation for
91251 ^ another, no one is able
91254 ^ to lay,
91255 ^ besides the [one] being already laid,
91258 ^ which is jesus christ.
91262 ^ if now anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, stones precious, wood, hay, straw,
91276 ^ of each the work manifest will become;
91281 ^ the for
91283 ^ day will disclose [it],
91285 ^ because in fire it is revealed;
91289 ^ and of each the work, what sort it is,
91295 ^ the fire itself will prove.
91299 ^ if of anyone the work will remain
91304 ^ which he built up,
91306 ^ a reward he will receive.
91308 ^ if of anyone the work will be burned up,
91313 ^ he will suffer loss;
91314 ^ he himself however will be saved,
91317 ^ so however as through fire.
91322 ^ not know you
91324 ^ that temple of god you yourselves are,
91328 ^ and the spirit - of god dwells? in you
91336 ^ if anyone the temple - of god destroys,
91343 ^ will destroy him - god;
91347 ^ - for
91349 ^ the temple - of god holy is,
91354 ^ which are you.
91357 ^ no one himself let deceive;
91360 ^ if anyone thinks [himself]
91363 ^ wise to be among you in the age this,
91371 ^ foolish let him become,
91373 ^ so that he may become wise.
91376 ^ the for
91378 ^ wisdom of the world this, foolishness with - god is.
91387 ^ it has been written for:
91389 ^ [he is] the [one] catching the wise in the craftiness of them.”
91397 ^ and again,
91399 ^ [the] lord knows the thoughts of the wise,
91405 ^ that they are futile.”
91408 ^ therefore no one let boast in men.
91413 ^ all things for of you are,
91417 ^ whether paul, or apollos, or cephas, or [the] world, or life, or death,
91429 ^ or things present,
91431 ^ or things to come—
91433 ^ all yours,
91435 ^ you now of christ,
91438 ^ christ now of god.
91441 ^ so us, let regard a man as servants of christ and stewards of the mysteries of god.
91452 ^ in this case moreover, it is required in the stewards,
91458 ^ that faithful one shall be found.
91462 ^ me however to the smallest matter it is,
91467 ^ that by you i be examined,
91471 ^ or by a human court.
91475 ^ in fact neither myself do i examine.
91479 ^ nothing for against myself i am conscious of,
91483 ^ yet not by this have i been justified;
91488 ^ the [one] however
91490 ^ judging me [the] lord is.
91494 ^ so then, not before [the] time anything judge,
91500 ^ until - shall have come the lord,
91505 ^ who both will bring to light the hidden things - of darkness,
91512 ^ and will make manifest the motives of the hearts;
91518 ^ and then the praise will come to each from - god.
91527 ^ these things now, brothers, i have applied to myself and apollos on account of you,
91537 ^ so that in us you may learn
91541 ^ -, not
91543 ^ beyond what has been written,
91546 ^ that not one for - one you be puffed up over the other.
91556 ^ who for you makes different?
91560 ^ what now have you
91563 ^ which not you did receive?
91566 ^ if now also you did receive [it],
91570 ^ why boast you
91572 ^ as not
91574 ^ having received [it]?
91575 ^ already satiated you are;
91578 ^ already you have been enriched;
91580 ^ apart from us you reigned,
91583 ^ and i wish that really you did reign,
91587 ^ so that also we you might reign with.
91592 ^ i think for,
91594 ^ - god us - apostles last has exhibited, as appointed to death,
91603 ^ because a spectacle we have become to the world, both to angels and to men.
91612 ^ we [are] fools on account of christ,
91616 ^ you however wise in christ;
91621 ^ we weak,
91623 ^ you however strong;
91626 ^ you honored,
91628 ^ we however without honor. as far as the present hour,
91635 ^ both we hunger
91637 ^ and thirst,
91639 ^ and are poorly clad,
91641 ^ and are buffeted,
91643 ^ and wander homeless,
91645 ^ and we toil,
91647 ^ working with [our] own hands.
91651 ^ being reviled, we bless;
91653 ^ being persecuted, we endure;
91655 ^ being slandered, we entreat.
91657 ^ as [the] scum of the earth we have become, of all [the] refuse, until now.
91666 ^ not
91667 ^ shaming you do i write these things,
91671 ^ but as children my beloved, admonishing [you].
91677 ^ if for ten thousand guardians you should have in christ,
91684 ^ yet not many fathers;
91688 ^ in for
91690 ^ christ jesus, through the gospel, i you have begotten.
91698 ^ i exhort therefore you,
91701 ^ imitators of me become.
91704 ^ on account of this i sent to you timothy,
91709 ^ who is my child, beloved and faithful in [the] lord,
91718 ^ who you will remind of the ways of me that [are] in christ jesus,
91728 ^ as everywhere in every church i teach.
91734 ^ as to not
91736 ^ coming now of me to you,
91741 ^ have become puffed up some.
91743 ^ i will come however shortly to you,
91748 ^ if the lord wills,
91752 ^ and i will find out not the talk
91757 ^ of those being puffed up,
91759 ^ but the power.
91762 ^ not for
91764 ^ in word the kingdom - of god [is],
91770 ^ but in power.
91773 ^ what desire you?
91775 ^ with a rod i should come to you,
91780 ^ or in love, a spirit then of gentleness?
91786 ^ actually is reported among you sexual immorality,
91791 ^ and such sexual immorality
91794 ^ as not even among the pagans,
91799 ^ so as for [the] wife one
91802 ^ of the father to have.
91805 ^ and you
91807 ^ puffed up are,
91809 ^ and not rather have mourned,
91813 ^ so that might be taken out of midst of you
91818 ^ the [one] the deed this
91822 ^ having done!
91823 ^ i
91824 ^ indeed, though
91826 ^ being absent - in body,
91829 ^ being present now - in spirit, already have judged
91835 ^ as being present
91837 ^ the [one] so this
91840 ^ having produced,
91841 ^ in the name of the lord our jesus having been gathered together you, and - of me in spirit, with the power of the lord of us jesus,
91861 ^ to deliver - such a one - to satan for destruction of the flesh,
91870 ^ so that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord.
91879 ^ not good [is] the boasting of you.
91884 ^ not know you
91886 ^ that a little leaven all the lump leavens?
91893 ^ cleanse out the old leaven,
91897 ^ that you may be a new lump,
91901 ^ as you are, unleavened.
91904 ^ also for the passover lamb of us has been sacrificed,
91910 ^ christ,
91911 ^ so that we might celebrate the feast, not with leaven old,
91917 ^ not with leaven of malice and wickedness,
91923 ^ but with unleavened [bread] of sincerity and of truth.
91929 ^ i wrote to you in the letter
91934 ^ not to associate with the sexually immoral,
91937 ^ not altogether with the sexually immoral the world of this, or with the covetous and swindlers, or idolaters —
91951 ^ since you would need then
91954 ^ from the world to depart.
91958 ^ now however, i wrote to you
91962 ^ not to associate with [him]
91964 ^ if anyone a brother
91967 ^ being designated, he is sexually immoral or a coveter, or an idolater or verbal abuser, or a drunkard, or swindler —
91980 ^ with such a one not even to eat.
91984 ^ what for [is it] to me
91987 ^ those outside to judge?
91990 ^ not those within you do judge?
91995 ^ those however
91997 ^ outside - god will judge.
92001 ^ expel the evil out from yourselves that.”
92007 ^ dare anyone of you,
92010 ^ a matter having against the other,
92015 ^ go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?
92024 ^ or not know you
92027 ^ that the saints the world will judge?
92033 ^ and if by you is to be judged the world,
92040 ^ unworthy are you
92042 ^ of cases of the smallest?
92044 ^ not know you
92046 ^ that angels we will judge?
92049 ^ how much more the things of this life?
92051 ^ the things of this life indeed so,
92054 ^ judgment [as to] if you have,
92057 ^ the [ones] being despised in the church,
92062 ^ those set you up!
92064 ^ for shame to you i say this. thus
92069 ^ not is there among you no one, a wise [man],
92075 ^ who will be able
92077 ^ to decide in between the brother of him?
92083 ^ instead, brother against brother goes to law,
92088 ^ and this before unbelievers!
92092 ^ already indeed therefore altogether a defeat for you it is,
92099 ^ that lawsuits you have among one another.
92104 ^ because of why not rather suffer wrong?
92109 ^ because of why not rather be defrauded?
92114 ^ but you do wrong
92117 ^ and defraud,
92119 ^ and these things to brothers!
92122 ^ or not know you
92125 ^ that [the] unrighteous ones of god [the] kingdom not will inherit?
92131 ^ not be deceived:
92133 ^ neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor coveters, not drunkards, nor verbal abusers, nor swindlers, [the] kingdom of god will inherit.
92156 ^ and such some [of] you were;
92160 ^ but you were washed,
92162 ^ but you were sanctified,
92164 ^ but you were justified, in the name of the lord jesus christ and by the spirit of the god of us.
92180 ^ all things to me are lawful,
92183 ^ but not all things do profit.
92187 ^ all things to me are lawful,
92190 ^ but not i will be mastered by anything.
92196 ^ the foods for the belly
92200 ^ and the belly the for foods,
92205 ^ - but
92207 ^ god both this and these will destroy;
92213 ^ - and
92215 ^ the body [is] not - for sexual immorality,
92219 ^ but for the lord,
92222 ^ and the lord for the body.
92227 ^ - and
92229 ^ god both the lord has raised up,
92234 ^ and us will raise out, by the power of him.
92241 ^ not know you
92243 ^ that the bodies of you members of christ are?
92250 ^ having taken then the members of the christ, shall i make [them] of a prostitute members?
92259 ^ never may it be!
92261 ^ or not know you
92264 ^ that
92265 ^ the [one] being joined to the prostitute, one body is?
92272 ^ will become,”
92273 ^ for it says,
92275 ^ the two into flesh one.”
92280 ^ the [one] however
92282 ^ being joined to the lord, one spirit is.
92288 ^ flee - sexual immorality.
92291 ^ every sin,
92293 ^ whatever if might do a man, outside the body is;
92301 ^ the [one] however
92303 ^ sinning sexually, against the own body sins.
92309 ^ or not know you
92312 ^ that the body of you a temple of the in you holy spirit is,
92323 ^ whom you have from god?
92327 ^ and not you are your own,
92331 ^ you were bought for with a price;
92334 ^ glorify therefore - god in the body of you.
92342 ^ concerning now
92344 ^ the things about which you wrote:
92346 ^ [it is] good for a man
92348 ^ a woman not to touch.
92351 ^ because of however
92353 ^ - sexual immorality, each man the [own] of him wife let have,
92360 ^ and each [woman] the own husband let have.
92366 ^ to the wife, the husband the duty let fulfill;
92373 ^ likewise now also, the wife to the husband.
92380 ^ the wife, the own body not has authority over,
92387 ^ but the husband;
92390 ^ likewise now, also the husband of the own body not has authority over,
92400 ^ but the wife.
92403 ^ not deprive one another,
92406 ^ if not - by mutual agreement, for a time,
92413 ^ that you might be at leisure - for prayer;
92417 ^ and again, together the same be,
92423 ^ so that not may tempt you - satan, through the lack of self-control of you.
92433 ^ this now i say by way of concession,
92438 ^ not by way of command.
92441 ^ i wish now
92443 ^ all men to be like even myself.
92449 ^ but each his own has
92453 ^ gift from god;
92456 ^ one [has] indeed this,
92459 ^ one however that.
92462 ^ i say now to the unmarried and to the widows,
92469 ^ [it is] good for them
92471 ^ if they should remain as even i.
92475 ^ if however not they have self-control,
92479 ^ let them marry;
92480 ^ better for it is
92483 ^ to marry
92484 ^ than
92485 ^ to burn with passion.
92486 ^ to those now
92488 ^ having married i give this charge — not i, but the lord —
92495 ^ a wife from a husband not is to be separated;
92500 ^ if however indeed she is separated,
92504 ^ let her remain unmarried,
92506 ^ or to the husband be reconciled;
92510 ^ and a husband a wife not is to send away.
92515 ^ to the now
92517 ^ rest i say — i not the lord:
92523 ^ if any brother a wife has
92528 ^ unbelieving,
92529 ^ and she consents
92532 ^ to dwell with him,
92535 ^ not let him divorce her.
92538 ^ and a woman if
92541 ^ any has a husband unbelieving,
92545 ^ and he consents
92548 ^ to dwell with her,
92551 ^ not let her divorce the husband.
92555 ^ is sanctified for the husband - unbelieving, in the wife;
92564 ^ and is sanctified the wife - unbelieving, in the husband;
92573 ^ else then the children of you unclean are;
92580 ^ now however holy they are.
92584 ^ if however the unbeliever separates himself,
92589 ^ let him separate himself;
92590 ^ not is under bondage the brother or the sister in - such [cases].
92600 ^ into however
92602 ^ peace has called you - god.
92607 ^ how for know you, wife,
92611 ^ if the husband you will save?
92615 ^ or how know you, husband,
92619 ^ if the wife you will save?
92623 ^ if not to each, as has assigned the lord,
92630 ^ to each as has called - god,
92635 ^ so let him walk.
92637 ^ and thus in the churches all i prescribe.
92644 ^ having been circumcised anyone was called?
92647 ^ not let him be uncircumcised.
92649 ^ in uncircumcision was called anyone?
92653 ^ not let him be circumcised.
92655 ^ - circumcision nothing is,
92659 ^ and - uncircumcision nothing is,
92664 ^ but keeping [the] commandments of god.
92668 ^ each in the calling
92672 ^ in which he has been called,
92674 ^ in this let him abide.
92677 ^ slave [being] were you called,
92679 ^ not to you let it be a care;
92682 ^ but if also you are able
92686 ^ free to become,
92688 ^ rather take advantage.
92690 ^ the [one] for
92692 ^ in [the] lord having been called [being] a slave, a freedman of [the] lord is;
92699 ^ likewise the [one] free
92702 ^ having been called, a slave is
92705 ^ of christ.
92706 ^ with a price you were bought;
92708 ^ not become slaves of men.
92712 ^ each wherein that he was called, brothers,
92717 ^ in that let him abide with god.
92722 ^ concerning now
92724 ^ the virgins, a commandment of [the] lord not i have;
92730 ^ judgment however i give,
92733 ^ as having received mercy from [the] lord,
92737 ^ trustworthy to be.
92739 ^ i think therefore
92741 ^ this good is, because of the
92746 ^ present necessity,
92748 ^ that [it is] good for a man
92751 ^ - in the same manner
92753 ^ to remain.
92754 ^ have you been bound to a wife?
92756 ^ not seek to be loosed.
92759 ^ have you been loosed from a wife?
92762 ^ not seek a wife.
92765 ^ if however also you shall have married,
92769 ^ not you did sin;
92771 ^ and if shall have married the virgin,
92776 ^ not she did sin;
92778 ^ tribulation however in the flesh will have - such;
92785 ^ i now you am sparing.
92789 ^ this now i say, brothers:
92793 ^ the season
92795 ^ shortened is.
92797 ^ - from now on that both
92801 ^ those having wives,
92804 ^ as none
92806 ^ having should be;
92808 ^ and
92809 ^ those weeping,
92811 ^ as not
92813 ^ weeping;
92814 ^ and
92815 ^ those rejoicing,
92817 ^ as not
92819 ^ rejoicing;
92820 ^ and
92821 ^ those buying,
92823 ^ as not
92825 ^ possessing;
92826 ^ and
92827 ^ those using the world,
92831 ^ as not
92833 ^ using [it] as their own.
92834 ^ is passing away for the present form of the world this.
92841 ^ i desire now
92843 ^ you without concern to be.
92846 ^ the unmarried man cares for the things of the lord,
92852 ^ how he should please the lord;
92856 ^ the [one] however
92858 ^ having been married, cares for the things of the world,
92863 ^ how he should please the wife,
92867 ^ and is divided.
92869 ^ and the woman - unmarried and - virgin, cares for the things of the lord,
92881 ^ that she should be holy both in body and in spirit;
92890 ^ the [one] however
92892 ^ having been married, cares for the things of the world,
92897 ^ how she should please the husband.
92901 ^ this now for the of you yourselves benefit i say,
92909 ^ not that a restraint you i might place upon,
92914 ^ but for what [is] seemly and devoted to the lord, without distraction.
92923 ^ if however anyone
92926 ^ to be behaving improperly to the virgin of him supposes,
92932 ^ if she is beyond youth,
92935 ^ and
92936 ^ so it ought to be,
92939 ^ what he wills let him do;
92942 ^ not he does sin;
92944 ^ let them marry.
92945 ^ he who however stands in the heart of him firm,
92953 ^ not having necessity,
92956 ^ authority however having over the own will,
92963 ^ and this has judged, in the own heart,
92970 ^ to keep - the virgin, well he will do.
92976 ^ so then also,
92978 ^ the [one] marrying the own virgin, well does;
92985 ^ and
92986 ^ the [one] not
92988 ^ marrying, better will do.
92991 ^ a wife is bound
92993 ^ for as long as time may live the husband of her;
93000 ^ if however shall have died the husband,
93005 ^ free she is
93007 ^ to whom she wills to be married,
93010 ^ only in [the] lord.
93013 ^ more blessed however she is,
93016 ^ if in the same manner she should remain, according to - my judgment;
93023 ^ i think now myself also
93026 ^ [the] spirit of god to have.
93029 ^ concerning now
93031 ^ the things sacrificed to idols, we know
93034 ^ indeed all knowledge we have.
93038 ^ - knowledge puffs up,
93041 ^ - but
93043 ^ love builds up.
93045 ^ if anyone thinks
93048 ^ to have known anything,
93050 ^ not yet does he know
93052 ^ as it is necessary
93054 ^ to know.
93055 ^ if however anyone loves - god,
93061 ^ he is known by him.
93065 ^ concerning the eating therefore
93069 ^ of the things sacrificed to idols, we know
93072 ^ that nothing an idol [is] in [the] world,
93077 ^ and that [there is] no god,
93081 ^ if not one.
93084 ^ even truly if indeed there are
93088 ^ [those] called gods, whether in heaven or on earth,
93096 ^ as there are gods many, and lords many,
93103 ^ yet to us [there is] one god, the father,
93109 ^ of whom [are] the things all,
93113 ^ and we for him;
93117 ^ and one lord, jesus christ,
93122 ^ by whom [are] the things all,
93126 ^ and we through him.
93130 ^ but not in all [is] this knowledge.
93136 ^ some now, - by habit until now,
93142 ^ of the idol
93144 ^ as of a thing sacrificed to an idol eat;
93147 ^ and the conscience of them
93151 ^ weak being, it is defiled.
93154 ^ food however us not will commend to god;
93161 ^ neither if not we should eat
93165 ^ do we come short,
93166 ^ nor if we should eat
93169 ^ have we an advantage.
93170 ^ be careful however,
93172 ^ lest somehow the right of you this an occasion of stumbling becomes to those being weak.
93182 ^ if for anyone sees you,
93187 ^ - having knowledge,
93190 ^ in an idol’s temple eating,
93193 ^ not the conscience
93196 ^ of him weak being, will be built up,
93200 ^ so as the things sacrificed to idols
93204 ^ to eat?
93205 ^ is destroyed for
93207 ^ the [one] being weak through - your knowledge, the brother
93215 ^ for whom christ died.
93219 ^ thus then sinning against the brothers
93225 ^ and wounding their - conscience
93230 ^ being weak, against christ you sin.
93234 ^ therefore if food snares the brother of me,
93241 ^ never not shall i eat meat to the age,
93248 ^ so that not the brother of me i might snare.
93254 ^ not am i free?
93257 ^ not am i an apostle?
93260 ^ not jesus the lord of us have i seen?
93266 ^ not the work of me, you are, in [the] lord.
93274 ^ if to others not i am an apostle,
93279 ^ yet at least to you i am;
93283 ^ the for
93285 ^ seal of my the apostleship, you are in [the] lord.
93293 ^ - my defense
93296 ^ to those me
93298 ^ examining is this.
93301 ^ no not have we [the] right
93305 ^ to eat
93306 ^ and to drink?
93308 ^ no not have we authority
93312 ^ a sister, a wife, to take about,
93315 ^ as also the other apostles, and the brothers of the lord, and cephas?
93327 ^ or only i and barnabas, not have we authority
93335 ^ not to work?
93337 ^ who serves as a soldier at his own expense at any time?
93342 ^ who plants a vineyard,
93345 ^ and the fruit of it not does eat?
93351 ^ or who shepherds a flock,
93355 ^ and from the milk of the flock not does drink?
93363 ^ not according to man, these things do i speak?
93368 ^ or also the law these things not says?
93375 ^ in for
93377 ^ the of moses law, it has been written:
93381 ^ not you shall muzzle an ox
93384 ^ treading out grain.”
93385 ^ not for the oxen is there care - with god?
93391 ^ or because of us entirely is he speaking?
93396 ^ for sake of us for it was written,
93400 ^ because ought
93402 ^ in hope
93404 ^ the [one] plowing
93406 ^ to plow,
93407 ^ and
93408 ^ the [one] threshing,
93410 ^ in hope
93412 ^ - to partake.
93414 ^ if we among you - spiritual things have sown,
93420 ^ [is it] a great thing
93421 ^ if we, from you - material things will reap?
93427 ^ if others of the over you authority partake,
93433 ^ [should] not more we?
93436 ^ but not we did use the right this.
93442 ^ instead, all things we bear,
93445 ^ so that not any hindrance we should place to the gospel of christ.
93454 ^ not know you
93456 ^ that
93457 ^ those in the temple
93460 ^ working, the things of the temple eat;
93466 ^ those at the altar
93469 ^ attending, in the altar partake?
93473 ^ so also, the lord has prescribed
93478 ^ to those the gospel
93481 ^ proclaiming
93482 ^ from the gospel to live.
93486 ^ i however not have used none of these.
93492 ^ neither have i written now, these things
93496 ^ that thus it should be with me;
93501 ^ [it were] good for me rather
93505 ^ to die,
93506 ^ than the boasting of me, anyone will make void.
93512 ^ if for i preach the gospel,
93515 ^ nothing there is to me boasting;
93519 ^ necessity for me is laid upon.
93523 ^ woe however to me be,
93527 ^ if not i should preach the gospel.
93530 ^ if for willingly this i do,
93535 ^ a reward i have;
93537 ^ if however unwillingly,
93540 ^ a stewardship i am entrusted with.
93542 ^ what then of me is
93546 ^ the reward?
93548 ^ that
93549 ^ in preaching the gospel free of charge, i should offer the gospel,
93554 ^ so as - not
93557 ^ to use up the right of me in the gospel.
93564 ^ free for being from all, to all myself i became servant,
93572 ^ so that the more i might gain.
93576 ^ and i became to the jews, like a jew,
93582 ^ so that jews i might win.
93585 ^ to those under [the] law, as under [the] law
93591 ^ not being myself under [the] law
93596 ^ so that those under [the] law i might win.
93601 ^ to those outside [the] law, like outside [the] law —
93605 ^ not being outside [the] law of god,
93609 ^ but under [the] law to christ —
93612 ^ so that i might win those outside [the] law.
93616 ^ i became to the weak, weak,
93620 ^ that the weak i might win.
93624 ^ these things to all i have become all,
93628 ^ so that by all means, some i might save.
93632 ^ all [things] now i do on account of the gospel,
93638 ^ that a fellow partaker with it i might become.
93642 ^ not know you
93644 ^ that
93645 ^ those in a race course
93648 ^ running, all indeed run;
93652 ^ one however receives the prize?
93657 ^ thus run,
93659 ^ that you might obtain [it].
93661 ^ everyone now
93663 ^ - striving, in all things controls himself;
93667 ^ they indeed then,
93670 ^ that a perishable crown they might receive,
93674 ^ we however an imperishable.
93677 ^ i therefore thus run, as not uncertainly;
93684 ^ so i fight,
93686 ^ as not [the] air beating.
93690 ^ but i batter of me the body
93695 ^ and bring [it] into servitude,
93697 ^ not hardly
93699 ^ to others having preached, myself disqualified i might be.
93704 ^ not i want for you
93708 ^ to be ignorant, brothers,
93710 ^ that the fathers of us all under the cloud were,
93719 ^ and all through the sea passed,
93725 ^ and all into - moses were baptized, in the cloud and in the sea,
93738 ^ and all the same spiritual food ate,
93745 ^ and all the same spiritual drank
93751 ^ drink;
93752 ^ they were drinking for from [the] spiritual
93756 ^ accompanying [them] rock;
93758 ^ the rock then was - christ.
93764 ^ nevertheless not with - most of them was well pleased - god;
93773 ^ they were strewn for in the wilderness.
93778 ^ these things now, types to us have become,
93783 ^ for - not
93786 ^ to be us desirers of evil things,
93790 ^ as they also desired.
93793 ^ neither idolaters are you to be,
93796 ^ as some of them;
93799 ^ as it has been written:
93801 ^ sat down the people
93804 ^ to eat
93805 ^ and to drink,
93807 ^ and rose up
93809 ^ to play.”
93810 ^ neither should we commit sexual immorality,
93812 ^ as some of them committed sexual immorality,
93816 ^ and fell in one day twenty three thousand.
93823 ^ neither should we test the christ,
93827 ^ as some of them tested,
93831 ^ and by - serpents were destroyed.
93836 ^ neither are you to grumble,
93838 ^ as some of them grumbled,
93842 ^ and perished by the destroyer.
93847 ^ these things now [as] types happened to them,
93852 ^ were written then for admonition of us,
93857 ^ to whom the ends of the ages are arrived.
93864 ^ therefore
93865 ^ the [one] thinking
93867 ^ to stand, let him take heed,
93869 ^ lest he fall.
93871 ^ temptation you not has seized,
93875 ^ if not what is common to man;
93878 ^ faithful now - [is] god,
93882 ^ who not will allow
93885 ^ you to be tempted
93887 ^ beyond what you are able,
93890 ^ but will provide, with the temptation, also the escape,
93898 ^ - to be able
93900 ^ to endure [it].
93901 ^ therefore, beloved of me, flee from - idolatry.
93908 ^ as to sensible [ones] i speak;
93911 ^ judge for yourselves
93913 ^ what i say.
93915 ^ the cup - of blessing
93919 ^ that we bless, not a participation is it
93924 ^ in the blood - of christ?
93928 ^ the bread
93930 ^ that we break, not a participation in the body - of christ is it?
93939 ^ because [there is] one loaf, one body the many we are;
93947 ^ - for
93949 ^ all of the one loaf we partake.
93955 ^ consider - israel according to flesh:
93960 ^ not
93961 ^ those eating the sacrifices, fellow partakers in the altar are?
93969 ^ what then do i mean?
93972 ^ that what is sacrificed to an idol anything is,
93976 ^ or that an idol anything is?
93981 ^ rather that
93983 ^ what they sacrifice to demons and not to god they sacrifice.
93990 ^ not i do wish now,
93993 ^ you fellow partakers - with demons to be.
93998 ^ not you are able
94000 ^ [the] cup of [the] lord to drink,
94003 ^ and [the] cup of demons.
94006 ^ not you are able
94008 ^ of [the] table of [the] lord to partake,
94011 ^ and of [the] table of demons.
94014 ^ or do we provoke to jealousy the lord?
94018 ^ not stronger than he are we?
94022 ^ all things are lawful,
94024 ^ but not all things are profitable.
94028 ^ all things are lawful,
94030 ^ but not all edify.
94034 ^ no one the [good] of himself let seek,
94038 ^ but that of the other.
94042 ^ everything - in the meat market
94046 ^ being sold, eat,
94048 ^ nothing inquiring on account of - conscience,
94053 ^ the lord’s,” for, [is] the earth, and the fullness of it.”
94062 ^ if anyone invites you
94066 ^ of the unbelieving,
94068 ^ and you wish
94070 ^ to go,
94071 ^ everything - being set before you eat,
94076 ^ nothing inquiring on account of - conscience.
94081 ^ if however anyone to you should say,
94086 ^ this offered to an idol is,
94089 ^ not do eat, on account of him
94093 ^ - having shown [it], and - conscience —
94098 ^ [the] conscience now, i am saying,
94101 ^ not -
94103 ^ your own, but that of the other;
94108 ^ that what for the freedom of me is judged by another’s conscience?
94117 ^ if i with thankfulness partake,
94121 ^ why am i denounced
94123 ^ for that which i give thanks?
94127 ^ whether therefore you eat,
94130 ^ or drink,
94132 ^ or whatever you do,
94135 ^ all things to the glory of god do.
94140 ^ without offense both to jews be you,
94144 ^ and greeks, and to the church - of god —
94151 ^ as i also all in all things please,
94156 ^ not seeking the of myself profit,
94161 ^ but that of the many,
94165 ^ that they may be saved.
94167 ^ imitators of me be,
94170 ^ as i also [am] of christ.
94173 ^ i commend now you
94176 ^ that in all things me you have remembered,
94180 ^ and as i delivered to you, the teachings
94186 ^ you are keeping.
94187 ^ i want however you
94190 ^ to know
94191 ^ that of every man the head - christ is,
94199 ^ [the] head now
94201 ^ of [the] woman [is] the man,
94204 ^ [the] head now
94206 ^ - of christ - god.
94210 ^ every man
94212 ^ praying
94213 ^ or prophesying,
94215 ^ [anything] on [his] head having, dishonors the head of him.
94222 ^ every now
94224 ^ woman
94225 ^ praying
94226 ^ or prophesying, uncovered with the head, dishonors the head of her;
94235 ^ one for it is,
94238 ^ and the same,
94241 ^ - with having been shaven.
94243 ^ if for not covers her head a woman,
94248 ^ also let her be shorn.
94250 ^ if [it is] now disgraceful to a woman
94254 ^ - to be shorn
94256 ^ or to be shaven,
94258 ^ let her cover her head.
94259 ^ a man truly for not ought
94264 ^ to cover the head,
94267 ^ image and glory of god being;
94272 ^ the woman however, [the] glory of man is.
94278 ^ not for is man of woman,
94284 ^ but woman of man.
94288 ^ truly for not was created man on account of the woman,
94296 ^ but woman on account of the man.
94301 ^ because of this, ought the woman
94306 ^ authority to have on the head, on account of the angels.
94314 ^ however, neither [is] woman separate from man,
94319 ^ nor man separate from woman, in [the] lord.
94325 ^ just as for the woman of the man [is],
94332 ^ so also the man by the woman [is];
94339 ^ the however
94341 ^ all things of - god.
94345 ^ in you yourselves judge:
94349 ^ becoming is it
94351 ^ for a woman revealed, - to god to pray?
94356 ^ not even - nature itself does teach you
94362 ^ that a man indeed, if he has long hair,
94367 ^ a dishonor to him it is;
94370 ^ a woman however if she has long hair,
94374 ^ glory to her it is?
94377 ^ for the long hair instead of a covering is given to her.
94384 ^ if now anyone is inclined
94388 ^ contentious to be,
94390 ^ we such custom no [other] have,
94395 ^ nor the churches - of god.
94400 ^ in this now instructing, not i do praise ,
94405 ^ because not for the better, but for the worse, you come together.
94415 ^ first indeed, for
94418 ^ coming together you in an assembly, i hear
94423 ^ divisions among you there to be,
94427 ^ and in part it i believe.
94431 ^ it behooves for
94433 ^ also factions among you there to be,
94438 ^ so that also the approved, evident should become among you.
94446 ^ coming therefore of you together in one place,
94452 ^ not it is
94454 ^ [the] lord’s supper to eat.
94457 ^ one for the own supper takes first
94463 ^ in - eating;
94466 ^ and this [one] indeed is hungry,
94470 ^ that [one] however is drunken.
94473 ^ no indeed houses not have you
94478 ^ in which to eat
94481 ^ and to drink?
94483 ^ or the church - of god do you despise
94489 ^ and put to shame
94491 ^ those nothing
94493 ^ having?
94494 ^ what shall i say to you?
94497 ^ shall i praise you in this?
94501 ^ not i praise [you]!
94503 ^ i for received from the lord
94509 ^ that which also i delivered to you,
94513 ^ that the lord jesus in the night
94520 ^ in which he was betrayed, took bread,
94524 ^ and
94525 ^ having given thanks, he broke [it]
94527 ^ and said,
94529 ^ this of me is
94532 ^ the body, which [is] for you;
94537 ^ this do in - of me remembrance.
94543 ^ likewise also the cup,
94547 ^ after - having supped,
94550 ^ saying,
94551 ^ this - cup the new covenant is
94558 ^ in - my blood;
94562 ^ this do,
94564 ^ as often as if you might drink [it], in - of me remembrance.
94571 ^ as often as for if you may eat the bread this,
94578 ^ and the cup may drink,
94582 ^ the death of the lord you proclaim
94587 ^ until that he should come.
94590 ^ therefore
94591 ^ whoever - should eat the bread
94596 ^ or should drink the cup of the lord unworthily, guilty will be
94605 ^ of the body and of the blood of the lord.
94612 ^ let examine however a man himself,
94616 ^ and in this manner of the bread let him eat,
94622 ^ and of the cup let him drink.
94627 ^ the [one] for
94629 ^ eating
94630 ^ and drinking judgment on himself, eats
94635 ^ and drinks
94637 ^ not discerning the body.
94641 ^ because of this, among you many [are] weak and sick,
94649 ^ and are fallen asleep many.
94652 ^ if for ourselves we were judging,
94656 ^ not - we would come under judgment.
94659 ^ being judged however by the lord, we are disciplined,
94665 ^ so that not with the world we should be condemned.
94671 ^ so then, brothers of me,
94674 ^ coming together
94675 ^ in order - to eat, one another wait for.
94680 ^ if anyone is hungry,
94683 ^ at home let him eat,
94686 ^ so that not for judgment you might come together.
94691 ^ - and
94693 ^ the other things,
94694 ^ as soon as - i might come, i will set in order.
94698 ^ concerning now - spiritual [gifts], brothers, not i do want you
94706 ^ to be ignorant.
94707 ^ you know
94708 ^ that when pagans
94711 ^ you were,
94712 ^ to - idols - mute,
94717 ^ even as - you were led, being carried away.
94721 ^ therefore i make known to you
94724 ^ that no one
94726 ^ in [the] spirit of god speaking, says
94731 ^ accursed [is] jesus,
94733 ^ and no one is able
94736 ^ to say,
94737 ^ lord [is] jesus,
94739 ^ if not in [the] spirit holy.
94744 ^ varieties now
94746 ^ of gifts there are,
94748 ^ - but
94750 ^ the same spirit;
94752 ^ and varieties of services there are,
94756 ^ but the same lord;
94760 ^ and varieties of workings there are,
94764 ^ the but
94766 ^ same god
94768 ^ - is working the all things in everyone.
94774 ^ to each now is given the manifestation of the spirit for the common profiting.
94784 ^ to one truly for through the spirit is given a word of wisdom,
94793 ^ to another now a word of knowledge, according to the same spirit,
94801 ^ and to a different one, faith by the same spirit,
94807 ^ to another now gifts of healing in that one spirit,
94815 ^ to another now working of miracles,
94819 ^ to another now prophecy,
94822 ^ to another now distinguishing of spirits,
94826 ^ and to a different one various kinds of tongues,
94829 ^ to another now interpretation of tongues.
94833 ^ all now
94835 ^ these things works the one and the same spirit,
94843 ^ apportioning individually to each
94846 ^ as he wills.
94848 ^ just as for the body one is,
94854 ^ and members many has,
94858 ^ all now
94860 ^ the members of the body,
94864 ^ many being, one are
94868 ^ body;
94869 ^ so also [is] - christ.
94873 ^ also for in one spirit, we all into one body were baptized,
94884 ^ whether jews or greeks, whether slaves or free;
94892 ^ and all one spirit we were made to drink.
94897 ^ also for the body not is one member,
94905 ^ but many.
94907 ^ if should say the foot,
94911 ^ because not i am a hand,
94915 ^ not i am of the body,
94920 ^ not on account of this, not is it of the body.
94928 ^ and if should say the ear,
94933 ^ because not i am an eye,
94937 ^ not i am of the body,
94942 ^ not on account of this, not is it of the body.
94950 ^ if all the body [were] an eye,
94955 ^ where [would be] the hearing?
94958 ^ if all [were] hearing,
94961 ^ where [would be] the sense of smell?
94964 ^ now however, - god has arranged the members, one each of them in the body,
94977 ^ as he desired.
94979 ^ if now were - all one member,
94986 ^ where [would be] the body?
94989 ^ now however, many even [are the] members,
94994 ^ one however body.
94997 ^ not is able now the eye
95002 ^ to say to the hand,
95005 ^ need of you not i have.
95009 ^ or again the head
95013 ^ to the feet,
95015 ^ need of you not i have.
95019 ^ but much rather, those seeming members of the body
95027 ^ weaker to be, indispensable are;
95031 ^ and
95032 ^ those which we think less honorable to be
95036 ^ of the body,
95038 ^ these honor more abundant we bestow;
95042 ^ and the unpresentable [parts] of us, decorum more abundant have;
95049 ^ - and
95051 ^ the presentable [parts] of us, no need have.
95056 ^ but - god has composed the body,
95062 ^ to the [parts] being deficient more abundant having given
95066 ^ honor,
95067 ^ that not there should be division in the body,
95074 ^ but the same for one another should have concern, the members.
95082 ^ and if suffers one member,
95087 ^ suffer with [it] all the members;
95091 ^ if is honored one member,
95095 ^ rejoice with [it] all the members.
95099 ^ you now are [the] body of christ,
95104 ^ and members in particular.
95108 ^ and some indeed has appointed - god in the church,
95117 ^ first apostles,
95119 ^ secondly prophets,
95121 ^ third teachers,
95123 ^ then miracles,
95125 ^ then gifts of healing, helping, administrating, various kinds of tongues.
95132 ^ not [are] all apostles?
95135 ^ not all prophets?
95138 ^ not all teachers?
95141 ^ not [have] all miracles?
95144 ^ not all gifts have
95148 ^ of healings?
95149 ^ not all in tongues do speak?
95153 ^ not all do interpret?
95156 ^ be desirous of however the gifts - greater.
95162 ^ and now, according to a more surpassing way, to you i show.
95169 ^ if in the tongues - of men i speak,
95175 ^ and - of angels,
95178 ^ love however not have,
95182 ^ i have become a brass
95184 ^ sounding, or a cymbal
95187 ^ clanging.
95188 ^ and if i should have prophecy
95192 ^ and understand the mysteries all, and all the knowledge,
95201 ^ and if i should have all the faith,
95207 ^ so as mountains
95209 ^ to remove,
95210 ^ love however not have,
95214 ^ nothing i am.
95216 ^ even if i may give away
95218 ^ all the possessions of me,
95222 ^ and if i may deliver up the body of me
95228 ^ that i may boast,
95230 ^ love however not have,
95234 ^ nothing i am profited.
95236 ^ - love is patient,
95239 ^ is kind; - love
95242 ^ not is envious; - love
95246 ^ not is boastful,
95248 ^ not is puffed up,
95250 ^ not acts unbecomingly;
95252 ^ not seeks the things of its own,
95256 ^ not is easily provoked,
95258 ^ not it keeps account - of wrongs;
95262 ^ not delights at - unrighteousness,
95267 ^ rejoices however in the truth.
95271 ^ all things it bears,
95273 ^ all things believes,
95275 ^ all things hopes,
95277 ^ all things endures.
95279 ^ - love never fails;
95283 ^ if however [there are] prophesies,
95286 ^ they will be done away;
95287 ^ if tongues,
95289 ^ they will be ceased;
95290 ^ if knowledge
95292 ^ it will pass away.
95293 ^ in part for we know,
95297 ^ and in part we prophesy;
95301 ^ when however should come the perfect,
95306 ^ the in part will be done away.
95310 ^ when i was a child,
95313 ^ i was speaking like a child,
95316 ^ i was thinking like a child,
95319 ^ i was reasoning like a child;
95322 ^ when i became a man,
95325 ^ i did away with the things of the child.
95329 ^ we see for presently, through a glass in obscurity;
95336 ^ then however, face to face;
95341 ^ presently, i know in part;
95345 ^ then however i will know fully,
95348 ^ as also i have been fully known.
95351 ^ now however abide faith, hope, love, the things three these;
95360 ^ [the] greatest however
95362 ^ of these [is] - love.
95365 ^ earnestly pursue - love;
95368 ^ earnestly desire now - spiritual gifts,
95372 ^ especially now that you might prophesy.
95376 ^ the [one] for
95378 ^ speaking in a tongue, not to men speaks,
95383 ^ but to god;
95385 ^ no one for hears;
95388 ^ in the spirit however, he utters mysteries.
95392 ^ the [one] however
95394 ^ prophesying, to men speaks [for] edification, and encouragement, and consolation.
95402 ^ the [one] speaking in a tongue, himself edifies;
95407 ^ the [one] however
95409 ^ prophesying, [the] church edifies.
95412 ^ i desire now
95414 ^ all you to speak in tongues,
95418 ^ rather however that you should prophesy;
95422 ^ greater [is] now
95424 ^ the [one] prophesying
95426 ^ than
95427 ^ the [one] speaking in tongues,
95430 ^ except if not he should interpret,
95434 ^ so that the church edification might receive.
95439 ^ now however brothers,
95442 ^ if i should come to you
95446 ^ in tongues speaking, what you will i profit,
95451 ^ if not to you i should speak either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in teaching?
95467 ^ even - lifeless things
95470 ^ a sound giving, whether flute or harp, if distinction to the sounds not they give,
95482 ^ how will it be known
95484 ^ what [is] being piped
95486 ^ or - being harped?
95489 ^ also for if indistinct [the] trumpet
95494 ^ sound gives,
95496 ^ who will prepare himself for battle?
95500 ^ so also you, with the tongue if not intelligible speech you give,
95511 ^ how will it be known
95513 ^ what [is] being spoken?
95515 ^ you will be for
95517 ^ into [the] air speaking.
95520 ^ so many
95521 ^ if it may be
95523 ^ kinds of languages there are in [the] world,
95528 ^ and none without meaning.
95531 ^ if therefore not i know the power of the sound,
95539 ^ i will be
95540 ^ to the [one] speaking a foreigner,
95543 ^ and
95544 ^ the [one] speaking to me a foreigner.
95549 ^ so also you, since zealous you are
95555 ^ of spiritual gifts,
95556 ^ for the edification of the church, search
95562 ^ that you should cause [it] to abound.
95564 ^ therefore
95565 ^ the [one] speaking in a tongue, let him pray
95569 ^ that he might interpret.
95571 ^ if for i pray in a tongue,
95575 ^ the spirit of me prays,
95579 ^ - but
95581 ^ the mind of me unfruitful is.
95585 ^ what then is it?
95588 ^ i will pray with the spirit,
95591 ^ i will pray however also with the mind.
95596 ^ i will sing praise with the spirit,
95599 ^ i will sing praise however also with the mind.
95604 ^ otherwise if you bless with the spirit,
95609 ^ the [one] filling the place of the uninstructed, how will he say the amen at - your thanksgiving,
95623 ^ since
95624 ^ what you say not he knows?
95628 ^ you truly for well are giving thanks,
95633 ^ but the other not is edified.
95638 ^ i thank - god
95641 ^ than all of you more, in tongues speaking;
95646 ^ but
95647 ^ in [the] church, i desire five words with [the] mind of me to speak
95656 ^ that also others i might instruct,
95660 ^ rather than ten thousand words in a tongue.
95665 ^ brothers, not children be in the minds.
95671 ^ yet in the evil, be little children;
95675 ^ in the however
95677 ^ thinking, full grown be.
95680 ^ in the law it has been written
95684 ^ -: by other tongues, and by lips other, i will speak to the people this,
95695 ^ and not even thus will they hear me,
95700 ^ says [the] lord.”
95702 ^ so then - tongues for a sign are, not
95709 ^ to those believing,
95711 ^ but to the unbelieving;
95714 ^ - but
95716 ^ prophecy [is] not to the unbelieving,
95720 ^ but
95721 ^ to the believing.
95723 ^ if therefore gathers the church whole together the place,
95732 ^ and all should speak in tongues,
95736 ^ come in however uninstructed ones or unbelievers,
95741 ^ not will they say
95743 ^ that you are mad?
95745 ^ if however all prophesy,
95749 ^ should come in then some unbeliever or uninstructed,
95755 ^ he is convicted by all,
95758 ^ he is examined by all,
95761 ^ the secrets of the heart of him manifest become.
95768 ^ and thus
95770 ^ having fallen upon [his] face, he will worship - god,
95776 ^ declaring
95777 ^ that certainly - god among you is.
95784 ^ what then is it, brothers?
95788 ^ when you may come together,
95790 ^ each a psalm has,
95793 ^ a teaching has,
95795 ^ a revelation has,
95797 ^ a tongue has,
95799 ^ an interpretation has.
95801 ^ all things for edification let be done.
95805 ^ if with a tongue anyone speaks,
95809 ^ [let it be] by two or the most three, and in turn;
95818 ^ and one let interpret.
95821 ^ if however not there is an interpreter,
95826 ^ let him be silent in [the] church;
95829 ^ to himself then let him speak,
95832 ^ and - to god.
95835 ^ prophets then,
95837 ^ two or three let speak,
95841 ^ and the others let discern.
95845 ^ if however to another a revelation should be made
95849 ^ sitting by,
95850 ^ the first let be silent.
95853 ^ you are able for
95855 ^ [one] by one all to prophesy,
95859 ^ so that all may learn
95862 ^ and all may be exhorted.
95865 ^ and spirits of prophets, to prophets are subject.
95870 ^ not for he is of disorder the god,
95876 ^ but of peace.
95878 ^ as in all the churches of the saints, the women in the churches let them be silent.
95891 ^ not for it is allowed to them
95895 ^ to speak,
95896 ^ but to be in submission,
95898 ^ as also the law says.
95903 ^ if however
95905 ^ anything to learn they desire,
95908 ^ at home the own husbands let them ask;
95914 ^ shameful for it is for a woman
95918 ^ to speak in [the] church.
95921 ^ or from you the word - of god has gone out?
95929 ^ or to you only has it come?
95934 ^ if anyone considers
95937 ^ a prophet himself to be,
95939 ^ or spiritual,
95941 ^ let him recognize
95942 ^ the things i write to you
95945 ^ that of [the] lord are
95948 ^ [the] commands.
95949 ^ if however anyone is ignorant,
95953 ^ let him be ignored.
95954 ^ so, brothers of me, earnestly desire
95958 ^ - to prophesy,
95960 ^ and
95961 ^ - to speak not do forbid in tongues.
95966 ^ all things however properly and with order let be done.
95973 ^ i make known now to you, brothers, the gospel
95979 ^ that i proclaimed to you,
95982 ^ which also you received,
95985 ^ in which also you stand,
95989 ^ by which also you are being saved,
95993 ^ to the word i proclaimed to you,
95997 ^ if you hold fast;
95999 ^ unless if not, in vain you have believed.
96004 ^ i delivered for to you in the foremost
96009 ^ what also i received,
96012 ^ that christ died for the sins of us according to the scriptures,
96022 ^ and that he was buried,
96025 ^ and that he was raised the day the third according to the scriptures,
96035 ^ and that he appeared to cephas,
96039 ^ then to the twelve.
96042 ^ thereafter he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once,
96048 ^ of whom the greater part remain until now;
96055 ^ some however have fallen asleep.
96058 ^ then he appeared to james,
96061 ^ then to the apostles all.
96065 ^ last then
96067 ^ of all, as the untimely birth, he appeared also to me.
96073 ^ i for am the least of the apostles,
96080 ^ who not am fit
96084 ^ to be called an apostle,
96086 ^ because i persecuted the church - of god.
96092 ^ [by the] grace however
96094 ^ of god, i am
96096 ^ what i am,
96098 ^ and the grace of him - toward me not void has been.
96108 ^ rather, more abundantly than them all i toiled,
96113 ^ not i however,
96116 ^ but the grace - of god that [was] with me.
96124 ^ whether therefore i or they,
96129 ^ thus we preach,
96131 ^ and thus you believed.
96134 ^ if now christ is preached
96138 ^ that out from [the] dead he has been raised,
96142 ^ how say among you some
96147 ^ that a resurrection of [the] dead not there is?
96152 ^ if however a resurrection of [the] dead not there is,
96158 ^ neither christ has been raised;
96161 ^ if then christ not has been raised,
96166 ^ [is] void then also the preaching of us,
96172 ^ void also the faith of you.
96177 ^ we are found then also false witnesses - of god,
96183 ^ because we have witnessed concerning - god,
96188 ^ that he raised up - christ,
96192 ^ whom not he has raised
96195 ^ if then [the] dead not are raised.
96200 ^ if for [the] dead not are raised,
96205 ^ neither christ has been raised;
96208 ^ if then christ not has been raised,
96213 ^ [is] futile the faith of you
96217 ^ still you are in the sins of you.
96223 ^ then also
96225 ^ those having fallen asleep in christ have perished.
96230 ^ if
96231 ^ in the life this, in christ having hope we are, only,
96240 ^ more to be pitied than all men we are.
96244 ^ now however christ has been raised out from [the] dead,
96250 ^ firstfruit
96251 ^ of those having fallen asleep.
96253 ^ since for by a man [came] death,
96258 ^ also by a man resurrection of [the] dead.
96263 ^ for as indeed in - adam all die,
96270 ^ so also in - christ, all will be made alive.
96277 ^ each however in the own order:
96283 ^ [the] firstfruit christ,
96285 ^ then those of christ at the coming of him;
96293 ^ then the end,
96296 ^ when he shall hand over the kingdom to the god and father,
96304 ^ when he shall have annulled all dominion and all authority and power.
96313 ^ it behooves for
96315 ^ him to reign
96317 ^ until that he shall have put all the enemies under the feet of him.
96327 ^ [the] last enemy to be abolished [is]
96330 ^ - death.
96332 ^ all things,” for he has put in subjection, under the feet of him.”
96339 ^ when however it may be said
96342 ^ that all things have been put in subjection,
96345 ^ [it is] evident
96346 ^ that
96347 ^ [is] excepted the [one] having put in subjection to him - all things.
96353 ^ when now shall have been put in subjection to him - all things,
96359 ^ then also himself the son will be put in subjection
96365 ^ to the [one] having put in subjection to him - all things,
96370 ^ so that may be - god - all in all.
96378 ^ otherwise what will they do
96381 ^ who are baptized for the dead?
96386 ^ if at all [the] dead not are raised,
96391 ^ why also are they baptized for them?
96396 ^ why also, we are in danger every hour?
96402 ^ every day i die,
96405 ^ as surely as the in you boasting, brothers
96410 ^ which i have in christ jesus the lord of us.
96418 ^ if according to man, i fought wild beasts in ephesus,
96424 ^ what to me the profit?
96428 ^ if [the] dead not are raised,
96432 ^ let us eat
96433 ^ and let us drink,
96435 ^ tomorrow for we die.”
96438 ^ not be misled:
96440 ^ do corrupt morals good, companionships bad.”
96445 ^ sober up righteously
96447 ^ and not sin;
96450 ^ ignorance for
96452 ^ of god some have;
96455 ^ to [the] shame of you i speak.
96459 ^ but will say someone,
96462 ^ how are raised the dead?
96466 ^ with what then
96468 ^ body do they come?
96470 ^ fool
96471 ^ you! what you sow not does come to life,
96476 ^ if not it dies.
96479 ^ and
96480 ^ what you sow,
96482 ^ not the body
96485 ^ that will be you sow,
96488 ^ but a bare grain,
96491 ^ if it may be of wheat, or of some of the rest.
96498 ^ - but
96500 ^ god gives it a body,
96504 ^ as he has willed,
96506 ^ and to each of the seeds, its own body.
96512 ^ not all flesh [is] the same flesh,
96518 ^ but one indeed of men,
96522 ^ another now flesh of beasts,
96526 ^ another now flesh of birds,
96530 ^ another now of fish.
96533 ^ and bodies [there are] heavenly, and bodies earthly.
96539 ^ but one truly [is] the of the heavenly glory,
96546 ^ another now that of the earthly.
96551 ^ one [is] [the] glory of [the] sun,
96554 ^ and another [the] glory of [the] moon,
96558 ^ and another [the] glory of [the] stars;
96562 ^ star for from star differs in glory.
96568 ^ so also [is] the resurrection of the dead.
96574 ^ it is sown in decay,
96577 ^ it is raised in immortality.
96580 ^ it is sown in dishonor,
96583 ^ it is raised in glory.
96586 ^ it is sown in weakness,
96589 ^ it is raised in power.
96592 ^ it is sown a body natural,
96595 ^ it is raised a body spiritual.
96598 ^ if there is a body natural,
96602 ^ there is also spiritual.
96605 ^ so also it has been written:
96608 ^ became the first man adam into a soul
96615 ^ living;
96616 ^ the last adam into a spirit
96621 ^ life-giving.”
96622 ^ however not first [was] the spiritual,
96627 ^ but the natural,
96630 ^ then the spiritual.
96633 ^ the first man [was] from [the] earth, made of dust;
96639 ^ the second man from heaven.
96644 ^ as the [one] made of dust,
96647 ^ so also [are] those of the earth;
96651 ^ and as the heavenly [one],
96655 ^ so also those of heaven.
96659 ^ and as we have born the image of the earthly,
96666 ^ we shall bear also the image of the heavenly.
96672 ^ this now i say, brothers,
96676 ^ that flesh and blood,
96680 ^ [the] kingdom of god to inherit not is able,
96685 ^ nor the decay, the immortality does inherit.
96691 ^ behold,
96692 ^ a mystery to you i tell.
96695 ^ all not we will sleep;
96698 ^ all however we will be changed — in an instant, in [the] twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet.
96710 ^ the trumpet will sound for,
96712 ^ and the dead will be raised imperishable,
96717 ^ and we will be changed.
96720 ^ it behooves for
96722 ^ the perishable this, to put on imperishable;
96727 ^ and the mortal this, to put on immortality.
96733 ^ when now the perishable this shall have put on [the] imperishable,
96740 ^ and the mortal this shall have put on immortality,
96746 ^ then will come to pass the word
96750 ^ - having been written:
96752 ^ has been swallowed up - death in victory.”
96757 ^ where of you, o death,
96760 ^ the victory?
96762 ^ where of you, o death,
96765 ^ the sting?”
96767 ^ - and
96769 ^ the sting - of death [is] - sin;
96774 ^ - and
96776 ^ the power - of sin, the law;
96781 ^ to however
96783 ^ god [be] thanks,
96785 ^ the [one] giving us the victory through the lord of us jesus christ.
96796 ^ therefore, brothers of me beloved, steadfast be,
96802 ^ immovable,
96803 ^ abounding in the work of the lord always,
96810 ^ knowing
96811 ^ that the toil of you not is in vain in [the] lord.
96820 ^ concerning now
96822 ^ the collection which [is] for the saints,
96828 ^ as i have directed the churches - of galatia,
96834 ^ so also you are to do.
96838 ^ every first of the week, each of you aside him let put,
96846 ^ treasuring up what
96848 ^ if he may be prospered in,
96850 ^ so that not when i might come
96854 ^ then collections there should be.
96857 ^ when then i shall have arrived,
96860 ^ whomever if you might approve,
96863 ^ with letters these i will send
96867 ^ to carry the bounty of you to jerusalem.
96873 ^ if then suitable it is
96877 ^ for me also
96879 ^ to go,
96880 ^ with me they will go.
96883 ^ i will come however to you,
96887 ^ when macedonia i shall have gone through;
96890 ^ macedonia for i am going through.
96893 ^ with you then
96896 ^ possibly i will stay,
96898 ^ or even i will winter,
96901 ^ so that you me may equip,
96905 ^ wherever if i may go.
96908 ^ not i want for
96911 ^ you now in passing to see;
96916 ^ i hope indeed
96918 ^ a time certain to remain with you,
96923 ^ if the lord permits.
96927 ^ i will remain however in ephesus until - pentecost.
96934 ^ a door for to me has opened
96938 ^ great and productive,
96941 ^ and
96942 ^ are opposing many.
96944 ^ if now comes timothy,
96948 ^ see
96949 ^ that without fear he might be with you;
96954 ^ the for
96956 ^ work of [the] lord he is doing, as also i.
96961 ^ not anyone therefore him should despise.
96966 ^ equip however him in peace,
96971 ^ so that he might come to me;
96975 ^ i am expecting for him, with the brothers.
96981 ^ concerning now
96983 ^ apollos the brother, greatly i exhorted him
96989 ^ that he should go to you with the brothers,
96996 ^ and at all not was [his] will
97001 ^ that now he should come;
97004 ^ he will come however
97006 ^ when he shall have opportunity.
97008 ^ watch you;
97009 ^ stand firm in the faith;
97013 ^ act like men;
97014 ^ be strong.
97015 ^ all things of you, in love let be done.
97020 ^ i exhort now you, brothers,
97024 ^ you know the house of stephanas,
97028 ^ that it is firstfruit - of achaia,
97033 ^ and to service to the saints, they have devoted themselves,
97040 ^ that also you be subject - to such as these, and
97047 ^ to everyone - joining in the work
97050 ^ and laboring.
97052 ^ i rejoice however at the coming of stephanas, and fortunatus, and achaicus;
97062 ^ because - your deficiency, these have filled up.
97068 ^ they refreshed for - my spirit and - yours.
97076 ^ recognize therefore - such as these.
97080 ^ greet you, the churches - of asia.
97086 ^ greet you in [the] lord heartily, aquila and prisca, with the at house of them church.
97100 ^ greet you, the brothers all.
97105 ^ greet one another with a kiss holy.
97110 ^ the greeting, the own hand of paul.
97116 ^ if anyone not loves the lord,
97122 ^ let him be accursed.
97124 ^ marana tha!
97126 ^ the grace of the lord jesus [be] with you.
97133 ^ the love of me [be] with all you in christ jesus.
97142 ^ paul, apostle of christ jesus by [the] will of god, and timothy, the brother, to the church - of god
97157 ^ - being in corinth, with the saints
97164 ^ all - being in all - achaia.
97171 ^ grace to you
97173 ^ and peace from god [the] father of us and [the] lord jesus christ.
97183 ^ blessed [be] the god and father of the lord of us jesus christ, the father - of compassions, and god of all comfort,
97201 ^ the [one] comforting us in all the tribulation of us,
97209 ^ for - to be able
97212 ^ us to comfort those in every tribulation through the comfort
97221 ^ with which we are comforted ourselves by - god,
97227 ^ because as abound the sufferings of the christ toward us,
97236 ^ thus so through - christ abounds also the comfort of us.
97245 ^ if however we are constricted,
97248 ^ [it is] for - your comfort and salvation;
97254 ^ if we are encouraged,
97256 ^ [it is] for - your comfort,
97260 ^ - operating in [the] endurance of the same sufferings
97267 ^ that also we suffer.
97271 ^ and the hope of us [is] steadfast for you,
97278 ^ knowing
97279 ^ that as partners you are
97283 ^ of the sufferings,
97285 ^ so also of the comfort.
97289 ^ not for do we want
97292 ^ you to be ignorant brothers, as to the affliction of us
97299 ^ - having happened in - asia,
97304 ^ that against excessively beyond [our] power, we were weighed,
97310 ^ so as to despair for us
97313 ^ even - to live.
97316 ^ but we in ourselves, the sentence - of death had,
97325 ^ in order that not
97327 ^ trusting we should be in ourselves,
97331 ^ but in - god,
97335 ^ the [one] raising the dead,
97339 ^ who from such a great a death has delivered us,
97345 ^ and will deliver [us],
97347 ^ in whom we have hope
97350 ^ that also still he will deliver [us],
97354 ^ joining together also of you for us by supplication,
97361 ^ so that by many persons, for the toward us grace bestowed, through many, thanks may be given for us.
97374 ^ - for
97376 ^ the boasting of us this is,
97380 ^ the testimony of the conscience of us,
97385 ^ that in [the] holiness and sincerity - of god, and not in wisdom fleshly, but in [the] grace of god, we have conducted ourselves in the world,
97405 ^ more abundantly now toward you.
97409 ^ no for other things we write to you,
97414 ^ other than what you read
97418 ^ or even understand;
97421 ^ i hope now
97423 ^ that to [the] end you will understand,
97427 ^ as also you have understood us in part,
97433 ^ so that boasting of you we are,
97437 ^ even as also you [are] ours, in the day of the lord of us jesus.
97448 ^ and with this - confidence i was planning previously
97454 ^ to you to come,
97457 ^ so that a second blessing of grace you might have,
97461 ^ and through you to pass through into macedonia,
97467 ^ and again from macedonia to come to you,
97474 ^ and by you to be set forward to - judea.
97481 ^ thus therefore purposing, not then - lightness did i use?
97489 ^ or
97490 ^ what i purpose, according to flesh do i purpose,
97495 ^ so that there should be with me - yes, yes, and - no, no?
97506 ^ faithful however - god [is],
97510 ^ that the word of us - to you not was yes” and no.”
97522 ^ the - of god for
97526 ^ son, jesus, christ
97529 ^ the [one] among you by us
97534 ^ having been proclaimed
97535 ^ by me and silvanus and timothy, not was yes and no,
97546 ^ but yes in him it has always been.
97551 ^ as many as for
97553 ^ promises of god [there are], in him [is] the yes.
97559 ^ therefore also in him the amen - to god [is] for glory by us.
97571 ^ the [one] now
97573 ^ establishing us with you unto christ,
97579 ^ and having anointed us, [is] god,
97583 ^ the [one] also
97585 ^ having sealed us,
97587 ^ and having given the pledge of the spirit in the hearts of us.
97597 ^ i however, as witness - god call
97603 ^ upon - my soul,
97607 ^ that
97608 ^ sparing you, not yet have i come to corinth.
97614 ^ not that we lord it over your - faith,
97620 ^ but fellow workers are
97623 ^ of the joy with you;
97626 ^ in the for
97628 ^ faith you stand firm.
97630 ^ i judged for within myself this,
97634 ^ - not again in grief to you
97641 ^ to come.
97642 ^ if for i grieve you
97647 ^ again, who
97649 ^ - is gladdening me,
97652 ^ if not
97654 ^ the [one] being grieved by me?
97658 ^ and i wrote this same thing,
97662 ^ so that not,
97664 ^ having come, grief i might have
97667 ^ from [those] of whom it behooves
97670 ^ me to rejoice,
97672 ^ trusting in all you,
97676 ^ that - my joy of all of you is.
97683 ^ out of for
97685 ^ much affliction and anguish of heart i wrote to you through many tears,
97695 ^ not that you might be grieved,
97698 ^ but the love that you might know
97703 ^ that i have more abundantly toward you.
97708 ^ if however anyone has caused grief,
97712 ^ not me has he grieved,
97715 ^ but in part —
97718 ^ that not i might put it too severely — all you.
97723 ^ sufficient to such a one [is] the punishment this, which [is] by the majority,
97733 ^ so that on the contrary rather for you to forgive
97738 ^ and to comfort [him],
97740 ^ lest perhaps - by more abundant sorrow should be overwhelmed - such a one.
97748 ^ therefore i exhort you
97751 ^ to confirm toward him love.
97755 ^ for this indeed also did i write,
97760 ^ so that i might know the proof of you,
97765 ^ whether to everything obedient you are.
97770 ^ to whomever now anything you forgive,
97774 ^ i also ;
97775 ^ and for i, to whom i have forgiven,
97780 ^ if anything i have forgiven,
97783 ^ [it is] for the sake of you in [the] person of christ,
97788 ^ so that not we should be outwitted by - satan;
97794 ^ not for of his - schemes we are ignorant.
97800 ^ having come now to - troas for the gospel - of christ,
97810 ^ also a door to me having been opened in [the] lord, not i had rest in the spirit of me,
97822 ^ in the not
97824 ^ finding my titus the brother of me;
97830 ^ instead,
97831 ^ having taken leave of them, i went out to macedonia.
97836 ^ to however
97838 ^ god [be] thanks,
97840 ^ the [one] always
97842 ^ leading in triumph us in - christ,
97847 ^ and the fragrance of the knowledge of him making manifest through us in every place.
97859 ^ for of christ a sweet perfume we are - to god
97865 ^ in those being saved
97868 ^ and in those perishing;
97872 ^ to one indeed an odor from death to death,
97879 ^ to one now, a fragrance from life to life.
97886 ^ and for these things who [is] sufficient?
97891 ^ not for we are, like the many,
97897 ^ peddling the word - of god;
97902 ^ but as of sincerity, but as of god, before god in christ we speak.
97915 ^ are we beginning
97916 ^ again ourselves to commend?
97919 ^ or not we need, like some, commendatory letters to you or from you?
97931 ^ the letter of us you are,
97936 ^ having been inscribed in the hearts of us,
97941 ^ being known
97942 ^ and being read by all men,
97947 ^ being revealed
97948 ^ that you are a letter of christ,
97952 ^ having been ministered to by us,
97955 ^ having been inscribed not in ink but with [the] spirit of god
97961 ^ [the] living, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of hearts human.
97971 ^ confidence now
97973 ^ such we have through - christ toward - god.
97981 ^ not that from ourselves sufficient we are
97987 ^ to reckon anything as of ourselves,
97992 ^ but the sufficiency of us [is] of - god,
97999 ^ who also has made competent us [as] ministers of a new covenant, not of [the] letter but of [the] spirit;
98010 ^ the for
98012 ^ letter kills,
98014 ^ - but
98016 ^ the spirit gives life.
98018 ^ if now the ministry - of death,
98024 ^ in letters having been engraved on stones, was produced in glory,
98031 ^ so as for not to be able
98034 ^ to look intently the sons of israel into the face of moses, on account of the glory of the face of him,
98048 ^ which is fading,
98050 ^ how not more, the ministry of the spirit will be in glory?
98060 ^ if for in the ministry - of condemnation [was] glory,
98067 ^ much more abounds the ministry - of righteousness [in] glory!
98075 ^ even for, not has been glorified
98079 ^ that having been made glorious in this - respect, on account of the
98087 ^ surpassing [it] glory.
98089 ^ if for
98091 ^ that which is fading away [was] through glory,
98095 ^ much more [is]
98097 ^ that remaining in glory!
98101 ^ having therefore such hope, great boldness we use,
98108 ^ and not as moses would put a veil over the face of himself,
98118 ^ for - not
98121 ^ to look intently the sons of israel into the end
98128 ^ of that fading away.
98130 ^ but were hardened the minds of them.
98135 ^ until for
98137 ^ the present day, the same veil at the reading of the old covenant remains,
98150 ^ not being lifted,
98152 ^ which in christ is being removed.
98156 ^ but unto this day, when - shall be read moses,
98163 ^ a veil over the heart of them lies.
98169 ^ whenever however if [one] shall have turned to [the] lord,
98175 ^ is taken away the veil.
98178 ^ the now
98180 ^ lord the spirit is;
98184 ^ where now the spirit of [the] lord [is], [there is] freedom.
98190 ^ we now
98192 ^ all,
98193 ^ having been unveiled in face, the glory of [the] lord beholding as in a mirror, the same image are being transformed into, from glory to glory, even as from [the] lord, [the] spirit.
98211 ^ because of this,
98213 ^ having the ministry this,
98217 ^ as we received mercy, not we lose heart.
98221 ^ but we have renounced the hidden things - of shame,
98227 ^ not walking in craftiness
98231 ^ nor falsifying the word - of god,
98237 ^ but - by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before - god.
98251 ^ if however indeed is
98255 ^ concealed the gospel of us,
98259 ^ to those who are perishing it is
98263 ^ concealed,
98264 ^ in whom the god of the age this has blinded the minds of the unbelieving,
98276 ^ so as for - not
98279 ^ to beam forth the illumination of the gospel of the glory - of christ,
98288 ^ who is [the] image - of god.
98293 ^ not for ourselves do we proclaim,
98297 ^ but jesus christ lord;
98301 ^ ourselves now,
98303 ^ servants of you, for the sake of jesus.
98307 ^ for [it is] - god,
98310 ^ - having said,
98312 ^ out of darkness light shall shine,”
98316 ^ who shone in the hearts of us for [the] radiance of the knowledge of the glory - of god in [the] face of jesus christ.
98334 ^ we have now the treasure this in earthen vessels,
98342 ^ that the surpassingness of the power may be - from god,
98350 ^ and not from us,
98354 ^ in every [way] being hard pressed,
98357 ^ but not being crushed;
98360 ^ being perplexed,
98361 ^ but not despairing;
98364 ^ being persecuted,
98365 ^ but not being forsaken;
98368 ^ being struck down,
98369 ^ but not being destroyed;
98372 ^ always the death - [of] jesus in [our] body carrying around,
98381 ^ so that also the life - of jesus in the body of us should be manifested;
98392 ^ always for we
98395 ^ the living to death are being delivered on account of jesus,
98402 ^ so that also the life - of jesus may be manifested in the mortal flesh of us.
98414 ^ so then, - death in us works,
98420 ^ - but
98422 ^ life in you.
98425 ^ having however the same spirit - of faith,
98432 ^ according to that having been written:
98435 ^ i believed,
98436 ^ therefore i have spoken,” also we believe,
98441 ^ therefore also speak,
98444 ^ knowing
98445 ^ that
98446 ^ the [one] having raised up the lord jesus, also us through jesus will raise up
98456 ^ and will present [us] with you.
98460 ^ - for
98462 ^ all things [are] for the sake of you,
98465 ^ so that the grace
98468 ^ having abounded through - more and more the thanksgiving may increase to the glory - of god.
98480 ^ therefore not we lose heart;
98483 ^ but if indeed the outward of us man is being brought to decay,
98491 ^ yet the inner of us is being renewed day and day.
98499 ^ the for
98501 ^ momentary lightness - affliction of us, far surpassing to excessiveness an eternal weight of glory is producing for us,
98515 ^ not are looking at we
98518 ^ the things being seen,
98520 ^ but
98521 ^ the things not
98523 ^ being seen.
98524 ^ the things for
98526 ^ being seen [are] temporary;
98528 ^ the things however not
98531 ^ being seen [are] eternal.
98533 ^ we know for
98535 ^ that if - earthly of us house,
98541 ^ the tent, should be destroyed,
98544 ^ a building from god we have,
98548 ^ a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
98554 ^ and indeed, in this we groan,
98559 ^ the dwelling of us which [is] from heaven to be clothed with longing.
98567 ^ if indeed also
98570 ^ having been clothed, not naked we will be found.
98574 ^ and for,
98576 ^ - being in the tent, we groan,
98582 ^ being burdened,
98583 ^ because that not we do wish
98587 ^ to be unclothed
98588 ^ but
98589 ^ to be clothed,
98590 ^ that may be swallowed up the mortal by - life.
98597 ^ the [one] now
98599 ^ having prepared us for very this [is] god,
98605 ^ - having given to us the pledge of the spirit,
98612 ^ being confident therefore always
98615 ^ and knowing
98617 ^ that,
98618 ^ being at home in the body, we are absent from the lord;
98626 ^ by faith for we walk,
98630 ^ not by sight.
98633 ^ we are confident now,
98635 ^ and are pleased, rather
98638 ^ to be absent out of the body,
98642 ^ and to be at home with the lord.
98647 ^ therefore also we are ambitious,
98650 ^ whether being at home
98652 ^ or being away, well-pleasing to him to be.
98657 ^ - for
98659 ^ all of us to be revealed it behooves
98663 ^ before the judgment seat - of christ,
98668 ^ that may receive back each the things [done] in the body,
98675 ^ according to what he did,
98678 ^ whether good
98680 ^ or evil.
98682 ^ knowing therefore the fear of the lord, men we persuade
98690 ^ to god and we have been made manifest;
98693 ^ i hope now also
98696 ^ in the consciences of you to have been made manifest.
98701 ^ not again ourselves are we commending to you,
98706 ^ but
98707 ^ occasion are giving to you
98710 ^ of boasting on behalf of us,
98713 ^ so that you may have [an answer]
98715 ^ toward those in appearance
98719 ^ boasting,
98720 ^ and not in [the] heart.
98724 ^ if for we are beside ourselves,
98727 ^ [it is] to god;
98728 ^ or if we are sober-minded
98730 ^ [it is] for you.
98731 ^ the for
98733 ^ love - of christ compels us,
98738 ^ having concluded this,
98740 ^ that one for all has died,
98745 ^ therefore - all have died.
98749 ^ and for all he died,
98753 ^ that
98754 ^ those living, no longer to themselves should live,
98759 ^ but
98760 ^ to the [one] for them
98763 ^ having died
98764 ^ and having been raised again.
98766 ^ therefore we from - now no one regard according to [the] flesh.
98775 ^ though even we have regarded according to flesh christ,
98781 ^ yet now no longer we regard [him thus].
98785 ^ therefore if anyone [is] in christ,
98790 ^ [he is] a new creation.
98792 ^ the old things have passed away;
98795 ^ behold,
98796 ^ has come into being [the] new.
98798 ^ - and
98800 ^ all things [are] of - god,
98804 ^ the [one] having reconciled us to himself through christ,
98810 ^ and having given to us the ministry - of reconciliation,
98817 ^ how that god was
98821 ^ in christ [the] world reconciling to himself,
98826 ^ not reckoning to them the trespasses of them,
98832 ^ and having put into us the word - of reconciliation.
98840 ^ for christ therefore we are ambassadors,
98844 ^ as though - god
98847 ^ is beseeching through us.
98850 ^ we implore on behalf of christ:
98853 ^ be reconciled - to god.
98856 ^ the [one] not
98858 ^ having known sin, for us sin he made,
98864 ^ so that we might become [the] righteousness of god in him.
98871 ^ working together now also we exhort
98875 ^ not in vain the grace - of god to receive you.
98884 ^ he says for:
98886 ^ in a time acceptable i listened to you,
98890 ^ and in a day of salvation i helped you.”
98896 ^ behold,
98897 ^ now [is the] time of favor;
98900 ^ behold,
98901 ^ now [is the] day of salvation.
98904 ^ nothing before no one placing
98908 ^ an obstacle,
98909 ^ so that not should be blemished the ministry,
98914 ^ rather,
98915 ^ in everything, we are commending ourselves as god’s servants,
98922 ^ in endurance great, in tribulations, in hardships, in distresses, in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings; in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in [the] spirit holy, in love genuine; in [the] word of truth, in [the] power of god; with the weapons - of righteousness for the right hand and for [the] left; through glory and dishonor, through bad report and good report;
98980 ^ as imposters,
98982 ^ and yet true;
98984 ^ as being unknown,
98986 ^ and yet
98987 ^ being well-known;
98988 ^ as dying,
98990 ^ and yet behold,
98992 ^ we live;
98993 ^ as being disciplined,
98995 ^ and yet
98996 ^ not being killed;
98998 ^ as being sorrowful,
99000 ^ always yet
99002 ^ rejoicing;
99003 ^ as poor,
99005 ^ many yet enriching;
99008 ^ as nothing
99010 ^ having,
99011 ^ and yet
99012 ^ all things possessing.
99014 ^ the mouth of us has been opened to you, corinthians;
99021 ^ the heart of us has been expanded.
99025 ^ not you are restrained by us;
99029 ^ you are restrained however in the affections of you.
99035 ^ - now
99037 ^ [as] the same recompense,
99039 ^ as to children i speak,
99042 ^ be expanded also you.
99045 ^ not become
99047 ^ unequally yoked together with unbelievers;
99049 ^ what for partnership [have] righteousness and lawlessness?
99055 ^ or what fellowship light with darkness?
99061 ^ what now harmony christ with belial?
99067 ^ or what part to a believer with an unbeliever?
99073 ^ what now agreement [the] temple of god with idols?
99080 ^ we for [the] temple of god are,
99085 ^ [the] living,
99086 ^ as has said - god
99090 ^ -: i will dwell in them,
99094 ^ and will walk among [them];
99096 ^ and i will be their god,
99100 ^ and they will be to me a people.”
99105 ^ therefore come out from the midst of them
99110 ^ and be separate,
99112 ^ says [the] lord,
99114 ^ and unclean nothing touch,
99118 ^ and i will receive you.”
99121 ^ and i will be to you for a father,
99126 ^ and you will be to me for sons and daughters,
99134 ^ says [the] lord almighty.
99137 ^ these therefore having
99140 ^ - promises, beloved, we should cleanse ourselves from every defilement of flesh and spirit,
99151 ^ perfecting holiness in [the] fear of god.
99156 ^ make room for us;
99158 ^ no one we have wronged,
99160 ^ no one we have corrupted,
99162 ^ no one we have exploited.
99164 ^ for condemnation not i speak;
99168 ^ i have before said for
99170 ^ that in the hearts of us you are,
99176 ^ for [us] - to die together,
99179 ^ and to live together.
99181 ^ great [is] my boldness toward you;
99186 ^ great my boasting on behalf of you;
99191 ^ i have been filled - with encouragement;
99194 ^ i overabound - with joy upon all the affliction of us.
99202 ^ and for having come of us into macedonia,
99208 ^ no had
99210 ^ rest the flesh of us;
99214 ^ but
99215 ^ in every [way] we are being pressed:
99218 ^ on the outside conflicts,
99220 ^ within fears.
99222 ^ but
99223 ^ the [one] comforting the downcast comforted us,
99229 ^ - god, by the coming of titus,
99235 ^ not only now by the coming of him,
99242 ^ but also by the comfort
99247 ^ with which he was comforted as to you;
99251 ^ relating to us - your earnest desire, - your mourning, - your zeal for me,
99264 ^ so as for me the more
99267 ^ to rejoice.
99268 ^ for if also i have grieved you in the letter,
99276 ^ not i do regret [it].
99278 ^ though even i did regret [it];
99281 ^ i see indeed
99283 ^ that the letter that,
99287 ^ if even for an hour, grieved you.
99293 ^ now i rejoice,
99295 ^ not that you were grieved,
99298 ^ but that you were grieved unto repentance;
99303 ^ you were grieved for according to god,
99307 ^ so that in nothing you might suffer loss through us.
99313 ^ the for,
99315 ^ according to god grief, repentance to salvation
99321 ^ without regret produces;
99323 ^ - and
99325 ^ the of the world grief, death produces.
99330 ^ behold for, this very same
99334 ^ thing, according to god
99337 ^ to have been grieved, how much has produced in you
99341 ^ earnestness, but instead reasoned defense, but indignation, but fear, but longing, but zeal, but vindication!
99354 ^ in everything, you have proved
99357 ^ yourselves innocent to be in this matter.
99362 ^ so if even i wrote to you,
99367 ^ [it was] not
99368 ^ for the sake of the [one] having done wrong,
99371 ^ nor for the sake of the [one] having suffered wrong,
99375 ^ but rather for the sake of - being revealed the earnestness of you, which [is] for us to you before - god.
99390 ^ on account of this, we have been comforted.
99393 ^ besides now
99395 ^ the comfort of us, the more abundantly rather we have rejoiced at the joy of titus,
99405 ^ because has been refreshed the spirit of him by all of you.
99413 ^ for if anything to him about you i have boasted,
99420 ^ not i was put to shame;
99422 ^ but as all things in truth we have spoken to you,
99429 ^ so also the boasting of us - to titus, truth became.
99439 ^ and the affections of him more abundantly toward you are,
99447 ^ remembering the of all of you obedience,
99452 ^ how with fear and trembling you received him.
99459 ^ i rejoice
99460 ^ that in everything i am confident in you.
99466 ^ we make known now to you, brothers, the grace - of god
99474 ^ - having been bestowed among the churches - of macedonia,
99481 ^ that in much proof of tribulation, the abundance of the joy of them and - of deep poverty of them abounded into the riches the generosity of them.
99504 ^ for according to [their] ability, i testify [that],
99508 ^ and beyond [their] ability,
99511 ^ [they were] willing of themselves, with much entreaty
99515 ^ imploring of us, for the grace and the fellowship of the service - among the saints.
99528 ^ and not [only] as we had hoped,
99532 ^ but themselves they gave, first to the lord, and then to us, by [the] will of god.
99543 ^ accordingly - exhorted we titus,
99548 ^ that as he had begun,
99551 ^ so also he might complete with you as well, the grace this.
99560 ^ but even as in every [way] you abound, in faith, and speech, and knowledge, and all earnestness, and in the from us to you love,
99580 ^ that also in this - grace you should abound.
99587 ^ not as a command do i speak,
99591 ^ but
99592 ^ through the of others earnestness, also the - of your love genuineness proving.
99603 ^ you know for the grace of the lord of us jesus christ,
99612 ^ that for the sake of you he became poor,
99616 ^ rich being,
99618 ^ so that you - through that poverty might be enriched.
99624 ^ and a judgment in this [matter] i give,
99629 ^ this indeed for you is profitable,
99633 ^ who not only
99636 ^ - to act,
99638 ^ but also - to will, have begun from a year ago.
99645 ^ now then also
99648 ^ the doing complete;
99651 ^ so that just as [there was] the readiness
99655 ^ of the to will,
99657 ^ so also
99659 ^ the to complete,
99661 ^ out of that which you have.
99664 ^ if for the readiness is present,
99669 ^ as if he might have
99672 ^ acceptable,
99673 ^ not as not he does have.
99677 ^ not for
99679 ^ that to others [there may be] ease
99682 ^ but for you affliction,
99684 ^ but of equality.
99687 ^ at the present time, - your abundance [will be] for the of those need,
99698 ^ so that also - their abundance may be for the of you need,
99708 ^ so that there may be equality.
99711 ^ as it has been written:
99713 ^ he the much not did abound,
99718 ^ and he the little not had lack.”
99724 ^ thanks however - to god,
99728 ^ the [one] putting the same earnestness for you into the heart of titus.
99739 ^ for [our] indeed
99742 ^ appeal he accepted,
99744 ^ very earnest however being, of his own accord he has gone out to you.
99751 ^ we have sent now with him the brother
99757 ^ whose - praise [is] in the gospel through all of the churches;
99767 ^ not only now,
99770 ^ but also
99772 ^ having been chosen by the churches fellow traveler of us, with - grace this
99782 ^ that [is] being administered by us toward the himself of the lord glory, and readiness of us,
99795 ^ avoiding this, lest anyone us should blame in the abundance this
99805 ^ - being administered by us.
99809 ^ we are taking great care to do for what is right, not only
99814 ^ before [the] lord, but also before men.
99820 ^ we sent with now them the brother of us,
99826 ^ whom we have proven in many things often
99831 ^ earnest to be,
99833 ^ now however much earnest by [his] confidence more which [is] in you.
99842 ^ whether as regards titus,
99845 ^ [he is] partner my and for you a fellow worker;
99851 ^ or brothers our,
99854 ^ [they are] apostles of [the] churches, [the] glory of christ.
99858 ^ - therefore the proof of the love of you and of our boasting about you, to them show in face of the churches.
99876 ^ concerning now for
99879 ^ the service - for the saints, superfluous for me it is
99888 ^ - to write to you.
99891 ^ i know for the readiness of you,
99896 ^ which concerning you i boast of to macedonians,
99901 ^ that achaia has been prepared from a year ago,
99906 ^ and - your zeal has been provoking the greater number.
99913 ^ i have sent however the brothers,
99917 ^ that not the boasting of us which [is] about you should be made void in the matter this,
99930 ^ that as i have been saying,
99933 ^ prepared you may be.
99935 ^ not perhaps if should come with me macedonians
99942 ^ and find you unprepared,
99946 ^ would be put to shame we —
99948 ^ that not we might say
99951 ^ you — in the confidence this.
99956 ^ necessary therefore i esteemed [it]
99959 ^ to exhort the brothers
99962 ^ that they should go before unto you
99966 ^ and should complete beforehand the
99969 ^ foreannounced blessing of you
99972 ^ this, ready to be thus as a blessing, and not as covetousness.
99982 ^ this now:
99984 ^ the [one] sowing sparingly, sparingly also will reap;
99990 ^ and
99991 ^ the [one] sowing upon blessings, upon blessings also will reap,
99999 ^ each
100000 ^ as he purposes in the heart,
100004 ^ not out of regret or of necessity;
100010 ^ a cheerful for
100012 ^ giver loves - god.
100016 ^ able [is] now - god
100020 ^ all grace to make abound to you,
100025 ^ so that
100026 ^ in every [way], always, all sufficiency having, you may abound in every work good.
100037 ^ as it has been written:
100039 ^ he has scattered abroad,
100040 ^ he has given to the poor,
100043 ^ the righteousness of him abides to the age.”
100050 ^ the [one] now
100052 ^ supplying seed
100054 ^ to him sowing and bread for food will supply
100061 ^ and will multiply the seed for sowing of you
100066 ^ and will increase the fruits of the righteousness of you,
100073 ^ in every [way] enriching you to all generosity,
100079 ^ which produces, through us, thanksgiving - to god.
100086 ^ for the ministry of the service this
100092 ^ not only is
100095 ^ completely filling up the needs of the saints,
100100 ^ but also is overflowing through many thanksgivings - to god,
100108 ^ through the proof of the service this, [they] glorifying - god at the submission of the of confession of you to the gospel - of christ and [the] generosity of the participation toward them and toward all;
100137 ^ and their supplication [is] for you, a longing for you on account of the
100146 ^ surpassing grace - of god upon you.
100152 ^ thanks [be] - to god for the indescribable of him gift!
100160 ^ myself now
100162 ^ i, paul, exhort you by the meekness and gentleness - of christ,
100173 ^ who as to appearance indeed [am] humble among you,
100180 ^ being absent however am bold toward you.
100185 ^ i implore [you] now
100187 ^ that, not
100189 ^ being present,
100190 ^ to be bold with the confidence
100193 ^ with which i reckon
100195 ^ to be daring
100196 ^ toward some - reckoning us
100201 ^ as according to flesh
100204 ^ walking.
100205 ^ in flesh for walking, not according to flesh do we wage war.
100213 ^ the for
100215 ^ weapons of the warfare of us [are] not fleshly,
100221 ^ but powerful - divinely to [the] demolition of strongholds,
100228 ^ arguments overthrowing,
100230 ^ and every high thing
100233 ^ lifting itself up against the knowledge - of god,
100239 ^ and
100240 ^ taking captive every thought into the obedience - of christ,
100248 ^ and
100249 ^ in readiness having,
100252 ^ to avenge all disobedience,
100255 ^ when might have been fulfilled your - obedience.
100260 ^ the things according to appearance are you looking.
100264 ^ if anyone is persuaded
100267 ^ in himself of christ to be,
100270 ^ this let him reckon again within himself,
100275 ^ that as he [is] of christ,
100279 ^ so also [are] we.
100282 ^ if even for more abundantly somewhat i should boast concerning the authority of us,
100292 ^ which has given [us] the lord for building [you] up and not for tearing down you,
100303 ^ not i will be ashamed,
100305 ^ that not [i] might seem
100308 ^ as if - to frighten you by means of the letters.
100315 ^ for the letters, indeed
100319 ^ they say,
100320 ^ [are] weighty and strong,
100323 ^ - but
100325 ^ the presence of the body weak,
100329 ^ and the speech
100332 ^ having been ignored.
100333 ^ this let reckon - such a one,
100337 ^ that such as we are - in word by letters
100344 ^ being absent,
100345 ^ such [we are] also
100347 ^ being present - in action.
100350 ^ not for dare we
100353 ^ to classify
100354 ^ or to compare ourselves [with] some
100358 ^ - themselves
100360 ^ commending;
100361 ^ but these
100363 ^ by themselves, themselves measuring,
100367 ^ and comparing themselves with themselves, not understand.
100373 ^ we however not into the things beyond measure will boast,
100380 ^ but according to the measure of the area
100386 ^ that has assigned to us - god,
100391 ^ a measure
100392 ^ to reach as far as also
100395 ^ you.
100396 ^ not for
100398 ^ as not
100400 ^ reaching to you, we are overextending ourselves;
100405 ^ as far as for also
100408 ^ you, we came in the gospel - of christ,
100415 ^ not to the things beyond measure boasting in others’ labors,
100423 ^ hope however having,
100426 ^ increasing the faith of you,
100430 ^ among you to be enlarged according to the area of us, to abundance,
100439 ^ so as that beyond you to preach the gospel,
100444 ^ not in another’s area, in things ready to boast.
100452 ^ the [one] however
100454 ^ boasting, in [the] lord let him boast.”
100458 ^ not for
100460 ^ the [one] himself
100462 ^ commending,
100463 ^ this [one] is approved,
100466 ^ but
100467 ^ the one whom the lord commends.
100471 ^ i wish you were bearing with me little a in foolishness,
100477 ^ but indeed you do bear with me.
100481 ^ i am jealous as to for you of god with [the] jealousy;
100486 ^ i have betrothed for you to one husband,
100491 ^ a virgin pure to present - to christ.
100496 ^ i am afraid however,
100498 ^ lest by any means as the serpent deceived eve in the craftiness of him,
100509 ^ might be corrupted the minds of you from the simplicity and the purity - in - christ.
100523 ^ if indeed for
100526 ^ the [one] coming, another jesus proclaims,
100531 ^ whom not we did proclaim,
100534 ^ or a spirit different you receive
100538 ^ which not you did receive,
100541 ^ or glad tidings different
100544 ^ which not you did accept,
100547 ^ well are you bearing with [it].
100549 ^ i reckon for
100551 ^ in nothing to have been inferior
100553 ^ to those most eminent apostles.
100556 ^ if however, even unpolished - in speech [i am],
100562 ^ yet not - in knowledge;
100566 ^ but
100567 ^ in every [way], we have been made manifest in all things to you.
100574 ^ or a sin did i commit,
100577 ^ myself humbling
100579 ^ so that you might be exalted,
100582 ^ because freely the - of god gospel i preached to you?
100590 ^ other churches i robbed,
100593 ^ having received support for the toward you service.
100599 ^ and
100600 ^ being present with you
100603 ^ and having been in need, not i did burden no one;
100608 ^ - for
100610 ^ the need of me completely filled up the brothers
100615 ^ having come from macedonia,
100618 ^ and in everything unburdensome myself to you i kept,
100625 ^ and will keep.
100627 ^ is [the] truth of christ in me,
100632 ^ that the boasting this not will be sealed up of mine in the regions - of achaia.
100645 ^ because of why?
100647 ^ because not i do love you?
100651 ^ - god knows [i do]!
100654 ^ what however i do, also i will do,
100659 ^ so that i might cut off the opportunity
100663 ^ of those desiring an opportunity
100666 ^ that
100667 ^ in what they are boasting, they might be found
100671 ^ as also we.
100674 ^ - for
100676 ^ such [are] false apostles, workers deceitful,
100680 ^ disguising themselves as apostles of christ.
100684 ^ and no wonder;
100687 ^ himself for
100689 ^ - satan masquerades as an angel of light.
100695 ^ [it is] not surprising therefore,
100698 ^ if also the servants of him masquerade as servants of righteousness,
100707 ^ whose - end will be according to the deeds of them.
100715 ^ again i say,
100717 ^ no one
100719 ^ me should think a fool to be;
100723 ^ if however otherwise
100726 ^ even as a fool receive me,
100731 ^ that i also little a may boast.
100736 ^ what i am saying, not according to [the] lord am i saying,
100742 ^ but as in foolishness, in this the confidence - of boasting.
100752 ^ since many boast according to [the] flesh,
100757 ^ i also will boast.
100759 ^ gladly for you bear with - fools,
100764 ^ wise being!
100766 ^ you bear [it] for
100768 ^ if anyone you enslaves,

100781 ^ if anyone in [the] face of you strikes [you].
100787 ^ as to dishonor i speak,
100790 ^ as that we have been weak!
100794 ^ in whatever however - anyone might be daring —
100800 ^ in foolishness i speak —
100803 ^ am daring i also.

100818 ^ as being beside myself i speak
100820 ^ above [measure]: i [too],
100822 ^ in labors more abundantly,
100825 ^ in imprisonments more abundantly,
100828 ^ in beatings above measure,
100831 ^ in deaths often.
100834 ^ from [the] jews five times forty [lashes] minus one i received.
100841 ^ three times i was beaten with rods,
100843 ^ once i was stoned,
100845 ^ three times i was shipwrecked,
100847 ^ a night and a day in the deep [sea] i have passed;
100852 ^ in journeyings often,
100854 ^ in perils of rivers, in perils of robbers; in perils from [my own] race, in perils from [the] gentiles; in perils in [the] city, in perils in [the] wilderness; in perils on [the] sea, in perils among false brothers;
100876 ^ in labor and toil,
100879 ^ in watchings often;
100882 ^ in hunger and thirst,
100886 ^ in fastings often;
100889 ^ in cold and nakedness.
100893 ^ besides the things external, the pressure on me - on every day [is my] care for all the churches.
100907 ^ who is weak,
100909 ^ and not i am weak?
100912 ^ who is led into sin,
100914 ^ and not i do burn inwardly?
100918 ^ if
100919 ^ to boast it behooves [me],
100921 ^ [in] the things of the weakness of me i will boast.
100926 ^ the god and father of the lord jesus knows,
100934 ^ the [one] being blessed to the ages,
100940 ^ that not i am lying.
100943 ^ in damascus the governor under aretas the king was guarding the city of the damascenes
100954 ^ to seize me.
100956 ^ but through a window in a basket i was let down through the wall,
100965 ^ and i escaped the hands of him.
100970 ^ to boast it behooves [me];
100972 ^ not is it profitable indeed.
100975 ^ i will go on however to visions and revelations of [the] lord.
100982 ^ i know a man in christ, ago years fourteen —
100989 ^ whether in [the] body,
100992 ^ not i know,
100994 ^ or out of the body,
100998 ^ not i know,
101000 ^ - god knows —
101003 ^ having been caught up - such a man to [the] third heaven.
101009 ^ and i know - such a man —
101014 ^ whether in [the] body
101017 ^ or out of the body,
101021 ^ not i know,
101023 ^ - god knows —
101026 ^ that he was caught up into - paradise,
101031 ^ and he heard inexpressible words,
101035 ^ - not being permitted to man to speak.
101040 ^ concerning - such a man i will boast;
101044 ^ concerning however
101046 ^ myself, not i will boast,
101049 ^ if not in the weaknesses.
101054 ^ if for i should desire
101057 ^ to boast,
101058 ^ not i will be a fool;
101061 ^ [the] truth for i will be speaking.
101064 ^ i refrain however,
101066 ^ lest anyone to me should credit
101071 ^ more than what he sees in me,
101075 ^ or hears anyone of me,
101080 ^ and the surpassingness of the revelations.
101085 ^ therefore that not i should become conceited,
101089 ^ was given to me a thorn in [my] flesh, a messenger of satan,
101096 ^ that me he might buffet,
101099 ^ so that not i should become conceited.
101102 ^ for this, three times the lord i begged,
101108 ^ that it might depart from me.
101112 ^ and he said to me,
101115 ^ suffices you the grace of me;
101120 ^ the for
101122 ^ power in weakness is perfected.
101126 ^ most gladly therefore rather will i boast in the weaknesses of me,
101134 ^ so that may rest upon me the power - of christ.
101142 ^ therefore i take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, and difficulties for christ;
101156 ^ when for i might be weak,
101159 ^ then strong i am.
101162 ^ i have become a fool;
101164 ^ you me compelled.
101167 ^ i for ought
101170 ^ by you to have been commended.
101173 ^ in no way for was i inferior
101176 ^ to those most eminent apostles,
101179 ^ though even nothing i am.
101183 ^ the indeed
101185 ^ signs of the apostle were performed among you in all perseverance, in signs both, and wonders, and miracles.
101200 ^ in what for is it
101203 ^ that you were inferior beyond the rest [of the] churches,
101209 ^ if not that myself i not did burden you?
101217 ^ forgive me the wrong this!
101222 ^ behold,
101223 ^ third time this, ready i am
101227 ^ to come to you,
101230 ^ and not i will burden [you];
101233 ^ not for i seek what [is] yours,
101238 ^ but you.
101240 ^ not for ought the children
101245 ^ for the parents to treasure up,
101248 ^ but the parents for the children.
101253 ^ i now most gladly will spend,
101257 ^ and will be utterly spent, for the souls of you.
101263 ^ if more abundantly you loving,
101267 ^ less i am loved?
101269 ^ be it so however,
101271 ^ i not did burden you;
101275 ^ but
101276 ^ being crafty, by trickery you i caught.
101281 ^ not any of whom i have sent to you,
101287 ^ by him did i exploit you?
101291 ^ i urged titus [to go],
101293 ^ and sent with [him] the brother.
101297 ^ not did exploit you titus?
101301 ^ not in the same spirit did we walk?
101306 ^ not in the same steps?
101310 ^ all along have you been thinking
101312 ^ that to you we have been making a defense?
101315 ^ before god in christ we speak,
101320 ^ - but
101322 ^ all things, beloved, for - your edification.
101328 ^ i fear for
101330 ^ lest perhaps,
101332 ^ having come,
101333 ^ not such as i wish i may find
101337 ^ you,
101338 ^ and i might be found by you
101341 ^ such as not you do wish;
101344 ^ lest perhaps quarreling, jealousy, anger, contentions, slander, gossip, conceit, disorder;
101354 ^ lest
101355 ^ again having come of me, should humble me the god of me as to you,
101365 ^ and i should mourn over many
101368 ^ of those having before sinned
101370 ^ and not having repented of the impurity and sexual immorality and sensuality
101380 ^ that they have practiced.
101382 ^ third this [time] i am coming to you.
101387 ^ in [the] mouth of two witnesses or three, will be established every matter.”
101396 ^ i have warned
101397 ^ and i warn,
101399 ^ as being present the second time,
101403 ^ and being absent now
101406 ^ those having sinned before, and the rest all,
101412 ^ that if i come to the [same] again,
101418 ^ not i will spare [anyone],
101420 ^ since a proof you seek,
101423 ^ -
101424 ^ in me speaking of christ,
101428 ^ who toward you not is weak,
101433 ^ but is powerful among you.
101437 ^ and for he was crucified in weakness,
101442 ^ yet he lives by power god’s.
101447 ^ also for we are weak in him,
101453 ^ but we will live with him by power god’s toward you.
101462 ^ yourselves examine
101464 ^ whether you are in the faith;
101469 ^ yourselves test.
101471 ^ or not do you recognize yourselves
101475 ^ that jesus christ [is] in you,
101480 ^ if not unapproved you are?
101484 ^ i hope now
101486 ^ that you will know
101488 ^ that we not are unapproved.
101493 ^ we pray now to - god,
101498 ^ not to do you wrong nothing,
101503 ^ not that we approved might appear,
101508 ^ but that you what [is] right may do;
101514 ^ we though as unapproved might appear.
101519 ^ nothing for have we power
101522 ^ any against the truth,
101526 ^ but for the truth.
101530 ^ we rejoice for
101532 ^ when we might be weak,
101535 ^ you however strong might be.
101539 ^ but this also: we pray for
101542 ^ the of you perfection.
101545 ^ because of therefore these things,
101548 ^ being absent i write,
101550 ^ so that
101551 ^ being present, not with severity i should treat [you], according to the authority
101558 ^ that the lord has given me, for building up and not for tearing down.
101569 ^ finally, brothers, rejoice!
101572 ^ be perfected,
101573 ^ be exhorted,
101574 ^ [be of] the same mind,

101693 ^ i am astonished

101755 ^ accursed let him be!
101757 ^ presently for of men do i seek approval, or - god?

101777 ^ i make known for to you, brothers, the gospel

101787 ^ that not it is according to man.
101792 ^ neither for i from man received it,
101799 ^ nor was i taught [it],

101838 ^ more abundantly zealous being
101841 ^ of the fathers of me traditions.
101845 ^ when however was pleased - god

101916 ^ of the apostles none i saw,
101920 ^ if not james, the brother of the lord.
101927 ^ in what now i write to you,
101931 ^ behold, before - god
101935 ^ -, not i lie.
101938 ^ then i went into the regions - of syria and - cilicia.
101948 ^ i was then
101950 ^ unknown - by face to the churches - of judea that [are] in christ.
101960 ^ only however hearing they were
101964 ^ that
101965 ^ the [one] persecuting us formerly, now is preaching the faith
101973 ^ which once he was destroying.
101976 ^ and they were glorifying in me - god.
101982 ^ then after fourteen years again i went up to jerusalem with barnabas,
101992 ^ having taken with [me] also titus.
101995 ^ i went up now according to a revelation
101999 ^ and set before them the gospel
102004 ^ that i proclaim among the gentiles —
102009 ^ apart individually however
102012 ^ to those esteemed —
102014 ^ lest hardly in vain i should be running
102019 ^ or have run.
102021 ^ but not even titus who [was] with me,
102027 ^ a greek being, was compelled
102030 ^ to be circumcised,
102031 ^ because of even
102033 ^ the brought in secretly false brothers,
102036 ^ who came in by stealth
102038 ^ to spy out the freedom of us
102042 ^ which we have in christ jesus,
102047 ^ that us they will enslave,
102050 ^ to whom not even for an hour did we yield - in subjection,
102057 ^ so that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.
102065 ^ of now
102067 ^ those esteemed
102069 ^ to be something —
102071 ^ whatsoever formerly they were, not to me makes a difference;
102077 ^ [the] person - god
102080 ^ of a man not does accept —
102083 ^ to me for
102085 ^ the esteemed nothing added.
102089 ^ but on the contrary,
102091 ^ having seen
102092 ^ that i have been entrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision,
102098 ^ just as peter [with that] of the circumcision
102102 ^ the [one] for
102104 ^ having worked in peter for apostleship of the circumcision did also in me toward the gentiles —
102116 ^ and having known the grace
102120 ^ - having been given to me, james and cephas and john,
102128 ^ those esteemed
102130 ^ pillars to be, [the] right hands gave to me and barnabas,
102137 ^ of fellowship,
102138 ^ that we [should go] to the gentiles;
102143 ^ they however to the circumcision.
102148 ^ only [they asked]
102149 ^ the poor that we should remember,
102153 ^ that also i was eager
102156 ^ the same thing to do.
102159 ^ when however came peter to antioch,
102165 ^ to face his i opposed [him],
102169 ^ because
102170 ^ condemned he stood.
102172 ^ before - for,
102175 ^ came certain ones from james, with the gentiles he was eating;
102183 ^ when however they came,
102186 ^ he was drawing back
102187 ^ and was separating himself,
102190 ^ being afraid of those of [the] circumcision.
102194 ^ and acted hypocritically with him also the rest of [the] jews,
102201 ^ so that even barnabas was carried away of them by the hypocrisy.
102208 ^ but when i saw
102211 ^ that not they are walking uprightly according to the truth of the gospel,
102219 ^ i said - to peter before all,
102224 ^ if you,
102226 ^ a jew being, like a gentile and not like a jew live,
102233 ^ why
102234 ^ the gentiles do you compel to judaize?
102238 ^ we, by birth jews, and not of [the] gentiles sinners,
102246 ^ knowing nevertheless
102248 ^ that not is justified a man by works of law,
102255 ^ if not through faith from jesus; christ even we in christ jesus have believed,
102267 ^ that we may be justified by faith from christ,
102272 ^ and not by works of the law;
102277 ^ because by works of the law not will be justified any flesh.
102285 ^ if however
102287 ^ seeking
102288 ^ to be justified in christ, have been found also we ourselves sinners,
102295 ^ [is] then christ of sin a minister?
102299 ^ never may it be!
102301 ^ if for that i had torn down,
102305 ^ these things again i build,
102308 ^ a transgressor myself i prove.
102311 ^ i for, through [the] law to [the] law died,
102317 ^ that to god i might live.
102320 ^ christ i have been crucified with;
102322 ^ i live now, no longer i;
102326 ^ lives however in me christ;
102331 ^ that which then now i live in [the] flesh, through faith i live,
102340 ^ that from the son - of god,
102345 ^ the [one] having loved me
102348 ^ and having given up himself for me.
102353 ^ not i do set aside the grace - of god;
102359 ^ if for through [the] law righteousness [is],
102364 ^ then christ for naught died.”
102368 ^ o foolish galatians! who you has bewitched,
102374 ^ whose before eyes jesus christ was publicly portrayed
102380 ^ [as] having been crucified?
102381 ^ this only i wish to learn from you,
102387 ^ by works of [the] law the spirit did you receive, or by hearing of faith?
102397 ^ so foolish are you?
102400 ^ having begun in [the] spirit, now in [the] flesh are you being perfected?
102405 ^ so many things did you suffer in vain,
102408 ^ if indeed also in vain?
102412 ^ the [one] therefore
102414 ^ supplying to you the spirit
102418 ^ and working miracles among you, [is it] out of works of the law or out of hearing of faith?
102430 ^ so also, abraham believed - god,
102435 ^ and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.”
102440 ^ know then
102442 ^ that those of faith,
102446 ^ these sons are
102449 ^ of abraham.
102450 ^ having foreseen then the scripture
102454 ^ that by faith justifies the gentiles - god, foretold the gospel - to abraham
102465 ^ -: will be blessed in you all the nations.”
102472 ^ so then, those of faith are blessed along with the believing abraham.
102481 ^ as many as for of works of [the] law are, under a curse are;
102490 ^ it has been written for
102492 ^ -: cursed [is] everyone
102495 ^ who not does continue
102498 ^ all things - having been written in the book of the law,
102506 ^ - to do them.”
102509 ^ that now by [the] law no one is justified before - god [is] evident,
102519 ^ because the righteous by faith will live.”
102525 ^ - and
102527 ^ the law not is of faith;
102532 ^ rather,
102533 ^ the [one] having done these things will live by them.”
102539 ^ christ us redeemed from the curse of the law,
102547 ^ having become for us a curse,
102551 ^ for it has been written:
102553 ^ cursed [is]
102554 ^ everyone - hanging on a tree”
102559 ^ so that to the gentiles the blessing - of abraham might come, in christ, jesus
102571 ^ so that the promise of the spirit we might receive, through - faith.
102580 ^ brothers, according to man i am speaking.
102584 ^ even of man
102586 ^ having been ratified a covenant, no one sets aside
102590 ^ or adds thereto.
102592 ^ - and
102594 ^ to abraham were spoken the promises,
102598 ^ and to the seed of him.
102602 ^ not it does say,
102604 ^ and - to seeds, as of many;
102610 ^ but as of one,
102614 ^ and to the seed of you,”
102618 ^ who is christ.
102621 ^ this now i say:
102624 ^ [the] covenant,
102625 ^ having been confirmed beforehand by - god, -
102630 ^ afterward four hundred and thirty years having come, [the] law not does annul,
102639 ^ so as - to nullify the promise.
102644 ^ if for by [the] law [is] the inheritance,
102650 ^ [it is] no longer by a promise;
102653 ^ - but
102655 ^ to abraham through a promise has granted [it] - god.
102661 ^ why then the law?
102665 ^ - transgressions
102667 ^ on account of, it was added,
102669 ^ until that should have come the seed
102674 ^ to whom promise has been made,
102676 ^ having been ordained through angels in [the] hand of a mediator.
102682 ^ - however,
102684 ^ a mediator of one [person] not is;
102688 ^ - but
102690 ^ god one is.
102693 ^ the therefore
102695 ^ law [is] contrary to the promises - of god?
102701 ^ never may it be!
102703 ^ if for had been given a law
102707 ^ - being able
102709 ^ to impart life,
102710 ^ indeed from out of [the] law - would have emerged - righteousness;
102717 ^ but imprisoned the scripture things all under sin,
102725 ^ so that the promise, by faith from jesus christ, might be given
102733 ^ to those believing.
102735 ^ before - now came - faith, under the law we were held in custody,
102744 ^ having been locked up until the being about faith
102749 ^ to be revealed,
102750 ^ so that the law trainer of us has become, unto christ,
102758 ^ so that by faith we might be justified.
102762 ^ having come now - faith,
102766 ^ no longer under a trainer we are.
102770 ^ all for sons of god you are through - faith in christ jesus.
102781 ^ as many as for into christ you were baptized, christ you have put on.
102788 ^ neither there is jew nor greek;
102793 ^ neither there is slave nor free;
102798 ^ neither there is male and female;
102803 ^ all for
102805 ^ you one are in christ jesus.
102811 ^ if now you [are] christ’s,
102815 ^ then - abraham’s seed you are, according to [the] promise heirs.
102823 ^ i say now,
102825 ^ for as long as time the heir a child is,
102832 ^ not he differs from a slave,
102835 ^ [though] owner of everything being.
102838 ^ instead, under guardians he is,
102842 ^ and trustees, until the time appointed by [his] father.
102849 ^ so also we, when we were children,
102855 ^ under the basic principles of the world were held in bondage.
102862 ^ when however had come the fullness of the time,
102869 ^ sent forth - god the son of him,
102875 ^ having been born of a woman,
102878 ^ having been born under [the] law,
102881 ^ that those under [the] law he might redeem,
102886 ^ so that the divine adoption as sons we might receive.
102890 ^ because now you are sons,
102894 ^ sent forth - god the spirit of the son of him into the hearts of us,
102906 ^ crying out,
102907 ^ abba, - father!
102910 ^ so no longer you are a slave,
102914 ^ but a son;
102916 ^ if now a son,
102919 ^ also an heir through god.
102923 ^ but at that time indeed
102926 ^ not knowing god, you were enslaved to those
102931 ^ by nature not being gods;
102935 ^ now however,
102937 ^ having known god,
102939 ^ rather however having been known by god, how do you turn again to the weak and destitute principles,
102953 ^ to which again anew to be enslaved you desire?
102958 ^ days you observe,
102960 ^ and months and seasons and years.
102966 ^ i fear for you,
102968 ^ lest perhaps in vain i have toiled for you.
102974 ^ become as i [am],
102977 ^ because i also [have become] as you,
102981 ^ brothers, i implore you.
102984 ^ in nothing me have you wronged.
102987 ^ you know now
102989 ^ that in weakness of the flesh i proclaimed the gospel to you at the first;
102998 ^ and the test of you in the flesh of me, not you did despise [me],
103008 ^ nor reject [me] with contempt;
103010 ^ but as an angel of god, you received me even as christ jesus.
103019 ^ what then the blessedness of you?
103024 ^ i bear witness for to you
103027 ^ that, if possible,
103030 ^ the eyes of you having gouged out, you would have given [them] to me.
103036 ^ so enemy of you have i become,
103040 ^ speaking truth to you?
103042 ^ they are zealous after you not rightly,
103046 ^ but
103047 ^ to exclude you [from us]. they desire
103050 ^ so that them you might be zealous after.
103053 ^ good [it is] now
103055 ^ to be zealous in a right [thing] at all times,
103059 ^ and not only
103062 ^ in - being present my with you.
103068 ^ children of me,
103070 ^ of whom again i travail
103073 ^ until that shall have been formed christ in you,
103079 ^ i was wishing indeed
103081 ^ to be present with you presently
103085 ^ and to change the tone of me,
103090 ^ because i am perplexed as to you.
103094 ^ tell me,
103096 ^ those
103097 ^ under [the] law
103099 ^ wishing
103100 ^ to be,
103101 ^ the law not you do listen to?
103105 ^ it has been written for
103107 ^ that abraham two sons had,
103112 ^ one of the slave woman and one of the free.
103121 ^ but the [one] indeed
103124 ^ of the slave woman, according to flesh has been born;
103130 ^ the [one] but
103132 ^ of the free, through [the] promise,
103137 ^ which things are
103139 ^ allegorized;
103140 ^ these for are two covenants:
103145 ^ one indeed from mount sinai,
103150 ^ unto slavery begetting,
103153 ^ which is hagar.
103156 ^ - and
103158 ^ hagar sinai mount is, in - arabia;
103165 ^ she corresponds now to the present jerusalem,
103170 ^ she is in slavery for with the children of her.
103176 ^ - but
103178 ^ the above jerusalem free is,
103182 ^ who is mother of us.
103186 ^ it has been written for:
103188 ^ rejoice, o barren woman,
103190 ^ the [one] not
103192 ^ bearing;
103193 ^ break forth
103194 ^ and call aloud,
103196 ^ the [one] not
103198 ^ travailing;
103199 ^ because many [are] the children of the desolate woman more,
103206 ^ than
103207 ^ of her having the husband.”
103211 ^ you now, brothers, like isaac, of promise children are.
103219 ^ but just as at that time
103222 ^ the [one] according to flesh
103225 ^ having been born was persecuting the [one born] according to spirit,
103230 ^ so also [it is] now.
103233 ^ but what says the scripture?
103238 ^ cast out the slave woman and the son of her;
103245 ^ no for
103247 ^ not will inherit the son of the slave woman along with the son of the free.”
103258 ^ so then, brothers, not we are of [the] slave woman children,
103264 ^ but of the free.
103267 ^ in freedom, us christ has set free;
103272 ^ stand firm, therefore,
103274 ^ and not again in a yoke of slavery entangle yourselves.
103280 ^ behold,
103281 ^ i paul say to you
103285 ^ that if you shall become circumcised,
103288 ^ christ you nothing will profit.
103292 ^ i testify now again to every man
103297 ^ being circumcised
103298 ^ that a debtor he is
103301 ^ all the law to keep.
103305 ^ you are severed from christ,
103308 ^ whoever in [the] law are being justified;
103312 ^ from grace you have fallen away.
103315 ^ we for, through [the] spirit by faith, [the] hope of righteousness eagerly await.
103323 ^ in for
103325 ^ christ jesus, neither circumcision any has power,
103331 ^ nor uncircumcision;
103333 ^ but only faith
103335 ^ through love working.
103338 ^ you were running well.
103340 ^ who you cut into,
103343 ^ the truth not to obey?
103347 ^ [this] persuasion [is] not
103350 ^ of the [one] calling you.
103354 ^ a little leaven whole the lump leavens.
103360 ^ i am confident as to you in [the] lord,
103366 ^ that no other mind will you have.
103370 ^ the [one] however
103372 ^ troubling you will bear the judgment,
103377 ^ whoever if he might be.
103380 ^ i now, brothers,
103383 ^ if circumcision still proclaim,
103387 ^ why still am i persecuted?
103390 ^ in that case has been abolished the offense of the cross.
103396 ^ i wish also will emasculate themselves
103399 ^ those upsetting you.
103402 ^ you for to freedom were called, brothers;
103408 ^ but not the freedom for an opportunity to the flesh.
103416 ^ rather through - love, serve one another.
103422 ^ - for
103424 ^ the entire law in one word is fulfilled
103430 ^ in this: you shall love the neighbor of you as yourself.”
103438 ^ if however one another you bite
103442 ^ and devour,
103444 ^ take heed,
103445 ^ lest by one another you might be consumed.
103449 ^ i say now,
103451 ^ by [the] spirit walk,
103453 ^ and [the] desire [of the] flesh no not you should gratify.
103459 ^ the for
103461 ^ flesh desires, against the spirit,
103466 ^ - and
103468 ^ the spirit against the flesh;
103472 ^ these for to one another are opposed,
103476 ^ in order not that if you might wish
103481 ^ those things you should do.
103483 ^ if however [the] spirit you are led by,
103487 ^ not you are under [the] law.
103491 ^ evident now are the works of the flesh,
103498 ^ which are sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, contentions, dissensions, factions, envyings, drunkennesses, carousing, and things like these,
103519 ^ as to which i forewarn you,
103522 ^ even as i warned before,
103524 ^ that
103525 ^ those such things
103528 ^ doing, kingdom god’s not will inherit.
103533 ^ - but
103535 ^ the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control;
103548 ^ against things such, no there is law.
103554 ^ those now
103556 ^ - of christ jesus, the flesh have crucified with [its] passions and - desires.
103568 ^ if we live by [the] spirit,
103571 ^ by [the] spirit also we should walk.
103574 ^ not we should become boastful,
103577 ^ one another provoking,
103579 ^ one another envying.
103581 ^ brothers, if even should be overcome a man in some trespass,
103589 ^ you, the spiritual [ones], restore - such a one in a spirit of gentleness,
103598 ^ considering yourself,
103600 ^ lest also you be tempted.
103604 ^ one another’s - burdens bear you,
103608 ^ and thus you shall fulfill the law - of christ.
103615 ^ if for thinks [himself] anyone
103619 ^ to be something,
103621 ^ nothing being,
103623 ^ he deceives himself.
103625 ^ - but
103627 ^ the work of himself test each,
103631 ^ and then as to himself alone, the ground of boasting he will have,
103639 ^ and not as to - another.
103644 ^ each for - his own load shall bear.
103650 ^ let share now
103652 ^ the [one] being taught in the word,
103656 ^ with the [one] teaching, in all good things.
103661 ^ not be misled;
103663 ^ god not is mocked.
103666 ^ whatever for if might sow a man,
103671 ^ that also he will reap.
103674 ^ for
103675 ^ the [one] sowing to the flesh of himself, from the flesh will reap decay.
103686 ^ the [one] however
103688 ^ sowing to the spirit, from the spirit will reap life eternal.
103698 ^ - and
103700 ^ [in] well doing, not we should grow weary;
103704 ^ in time for
103706 ^ due, we will reap a harvest
103708 ^ not giving up.
103710 ^ so then, as occasion we have,
103715 ^ we should work - good toward all,
103720 ^ especially now toward those of the household of the of faith.
103727 ^ see
103728 ^ in how large to you
103730 ^ letters i have written with my own hand.
103735 ^ as many as wish
103737 ^ to have a fair appearance in [the] flesh,
103740 ^ these compel you
103743 ^ to be circumcised,
103744 ^ only that for the cross - of christ not they might be persecuted.
103752 ^ not even for
103754 ^ those being circumcised themselves [the] law keep,
103759 ^ but they desire you
103762 ^ to be circumcised,
103763 ^ so that in - your flesh they may boast.
103769 ^ for me however, never may it be
103773 ^ to boast,
103774 ^ if never in the cross of the lord of us jesus christ,
103784 ^ through which to me [the] world has been crucified,
103789 ^ and i [to the] world.
103791 ^ neither for circumcision anything is,
103796 ^ nor uncircumcision;
103798 ^ instead a new creation.
103801 ^ and as many as those who rule by this will walk,
103807 ^ peace [be] upon them,
103810 ^ and mercy; and upon the israel - of god.

104278 ^ - now
104280 ^ working in the sons - of disobedience,
104286 ^ among whom also we all lived once in the desires of the flesh of us,
104299 ^ doing the things willed of the flesh, and of [its] thoughts;

104373 ^ - for by grace you are
104377 ^ saved through faith,
104380 ^ and this not of yourselves;
104385 ^ [it is] of god the gift,
104388 ^ not as a result of works,
104391 ^ so that not anyone may boast.
104395 ^ of him for we are
104398 ^ workmanship,
104399 ^ having been created in christ jesus for works good,
104406 ^ which prepared beforehand - god,
104410 ^ that in them we should walk.
104414 ^ therefore remember
104416 ^ that formerly you the gentiles in [the] flesh,
104423 ^ the ones being called [the] uncircumcision by that
104428 ^ being called [the] circumcision, in [the] flesh made by hands —
104433 ^ that you were at the time that separate from christ,
104440 ^ alienated from the commonwealth - of israel, and strangers to the covenants of the promise,
104451 ^ hope not having and without god in the world.
104459 ^ now however in christ jesus, you
104465 ^ the [ones] once being far off have become near by the blood - of christ.
104476 ^ he himself for is the peace of us,
104482 ^ - having made - both one,
104487 ^ and the barrier of the fence having broken down,
104493 ^ the hostility, in the flesh of him,
104499 ^ the law - of commandments in ordinances having annulled,
104506 ^ so that the two he might create in himself into one new man,
104516 ^ making peace;
104518 ^ and he might reconcile - both in one body - to god through the cross,
104530 ^ having slain the hostility by it.
104535 ^ and
104536 ^ having come, he proclaimed the gospel: peace to you, the [ones] far off,
104542 ^ and peace to those near.
104546 ^ for through him we have the access - both by one spirit to the father.
104560 ^ so then no longer are you strangers and aliens,
104567 ^ but are fellow citizens of the saints and of the household - of god,
104576 ^ having been built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
104584 ^ being [the] cornerstone himself christ jesus,
104589 ^ in whom the whole building,
104593 ^ being fitted together, is increasing into a temple, holy in [the] lord,
104600 ^ in whom also you are being built together for a habitation - of god in [the] spirit.
104611 ^ of this for reason, i paul, the prisoner - of christ jesus, for you - gentiles...
104624 ^ if indeed you have heard of the administration of the grace - of god,
104633 ^ - having been given to me toward you,
104638 ^ that by revelation he made known to me the mystery,
104645 ^ just as i have written before in brief,
104649 ^ by which you are able, reading [it],
104653 ^ to understand the insight of me into the mystery - of christ,
104662 ^ which in other generations not was made known to the sons - of men,
104671 ^ as now it has been revealed to holy apostles his and prophets in [the] spirit,
104682 ^ are the gentiles joint-heirs, and a joint-body, and joint-partakers of the promise in christ jesus, through the gospel,
104698 ^ of which i became
104700 ^ servant according to the gift of the grace - of god
104708 ^ -, having been given to me according to the working of the power of him.
104717 ^ to me, the very least of all saints, was given the grace this:
104726 ^ to the gentiles to preach the unsearchable riches - of christ,
104734 ^ and to enlighten all
104737 ^ what [is] the administration of the mystery
104742 ^ - having been hidden from the ages in - god,
104750 ^ the [one] - all things
104753 ^ having created,
104754 ^ so that should be made known now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly realms, through the church, the manifold wisdom - of god, according to [the] purpose of the ages,
104777 ^ which he accomplished in - christ jesus the lord of us,
104786 ^ in whom we have - boldness and access in confidence, by the faith from him.
104799 ^ therefore i implore [you]
104801 ^ not to lose heart at the tribulations of me for you,
104809 ^ which is glory of you.
104813 ^ ... of this for reason i bow the knees of me to the father,
104822 ^ from whom every family in [the] heavens and on earth is named,
104832 ^ that he might give you according to the riches of the glory of him,
104841 ^ with power, to be strengthened by the spirit of him
104847 ^ in the inner man, [for] to dwell - christ through - faith in the hearts of you,
104861 ^ in love being rooted
104864 ^ and being founded,
104866 ^ so that you may be fully able
104868 ^ to comprehend with all the saints
104873 ^ what [is] the breadth and length and height and depth,
104882 ^ to know then the
104885 ^ surpassing - knowledge love - of christ,
104891 ^ so that you may be filled unto all the fullness - of god.
104899 ^ to the [one] now
104901 ^ being able
104902 ^ above all things to do exceedingly
104906 ^ that we ask
104908 ^ or think, according to the power
104913 ^ - working in us,
104917 ^ to him [be] the glory in the church and in christ jesus to all the generations of the age of the ages. amen.
104936 ^ exhort therefore you i, the prisoner in [the] lord,
104944 ^ worthily to walk
104946 ^ of the calling
104948 ^ to which you were called, with all humility and gentleness,
104955 ^ with patience, bearing with one another in love,
104961 ^ being diligent
104962 ^ to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond - of peace;
104972 ^ one body and one spirit,
104977 ^ just as also you were called into one hope of the calling of you;
104986 ^ one lord,
104988 ^ one faith,
104990 ^ one baptism;
104992 ^ one god and father of all, who [is] over all and through all and in all.
105006 ^ one now
105008 ^ to each of us has been given - grace according to the measure of the gift - of christ.
105020 ^ therefore it says:
105022 ^ having ascended on high, he led captive captivity,
105027 ^ [and] gave gifts - to men.”
105031 ^ - and, he ascended,” what is
105036 ^ if not
105038 ^ that also he descended into the lower regions of the earth?
105047 ^ the [one]
105048 ^ having descended, the same is also
105052 ^ [one] having ascended above all the heavens,
105058 ^ so that he might fill - all things.
105062 ^ and he gave some indeed [to be] apostles, some now prophets, some now evangelists, some now shepherds and teachers, toward the perfecting of the saints, for [the] work of ministry, for [the] building up of the body - of christ,
105093 ^ until we may attain - all to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son - of god, unto a man a complete, to [the] measure of [the] stature of the fullness - of christ,
105119 ^ so that no longer we might be infants,
105123 ^ being tossed by waves
105124 ^ and being carried about by every wind - of teaching, in the cunning - of men in craftiness, with a view to the scheming - of deceit.
105142 ^ speaking the truth however in love, we should grow up into him in all things
105151 ^ who is the head, christ,
105156 ^ from whom all the body,
105161 ^ being joined together
105162 ^ and being held together by every ligament of [its] supply, according to [the] working in [the] measure individual of each part, the increase of the body makes for itself to [the] building up of itself in love.
105186 ^ this therefore i say
105189 ^ and testify in [the] lord:
105193 ^ no longer [are] you to walk
105196 ^ as also the gentiles are walking, in [the] futility of the mind of them,
105206 ^ being darkened in the understanding,
105209 ^ being
105210 ^ alienated from the life - of god, because of the ignorance
105218 ^ - being in them, on account of the hardness of the heart of them,
105228 ^ who
105229 ^ having cast off all feeling, themselves have given up to sensuality, for [the] working of impurity, all with greediness.
105240 ^ you however not this way learned - christ,
105247 ^ if indeed him you have heard
105251 ^ and in him have been taught,
105255 ^ just as is [the] truth in - jesus.
105261 ^ are to have put off you, concerning the former way of life, the old man,
105270 ^ which is being corrupted, according to [its] desires - of deceit,
105277 ^ to be renewed then in the spirit of the mind of you,
105284 ^ and to have put on the new man,
105289 ^ - according to god
105292 ^ having been created in righteousness and holiness - of truth.
105299 ^ therefore
105300 ^ having put off - falsehood, let speak truth each one with the neighbor of him,
105310 ^ because we are of one another members.
105314 ^ be angry,
105315 ^ and yet not sin.”
105318 ^ the sun not let set upon - anger of you;
105326 ^ neither give opportunity to the devil.
105331 ^ the [one] stealing, no longer let him steal;
105335 ^ rather however let him toil,
105338 ^ working with the own hands what [is] good,
105344 ^ so that he may have [something]
105346 ^ to impart
105347 ^ to the [one] need
105349 ^ having.
105350 ^ any word unwholesome out of the mouth of you not let go forth,
105359 ^ but if any good for edification of the need,
105367 ^ so that it may give grace
105370 ^ to those hearing.
105372 ^ and not grieve the spirit - holy - of god,
105381 ^ in whom you were sealed for [the] day of redemption.
105387 ^ all bitterness, and rage, and anger, and clamor, and slander, let be removed from you, along with all malice.
105403 ^ be now to one another kind, tender-hearted,
105409 ^ forgiving each other,
105411 ^ as also - god in christ forgave you.
105419 ^ be therefore imitators - of god, as children beloved,
105427 ^ and walk in love,
105431 ^ just as also - christ loved us
105437 ^ and gave up himself for us [as] an offering and a sacrifice - to god, into an aroma of a sweet smell.
105450 ^ sexual immorality however, and impurity all, or covetousness, not even let be named among you,
105461 ^ as also is proper to saints,
105464 ^ and filthiness, and foolish talking, or crude joking,
105470 ^ which not are fitting;
105473 ^ but rather thanksgiving.
105476 ^ this for you know, realizing
105480 ^ that any fornicator, or unclean person, or covetous man,
105487 ^ who is an idolater, not has inheritance in the kingdom - of christ, and of god.
105500 ^ no one you let deceive with empty words,
105505 ^ because of these things for comes the wrath - of god upon the sons - of disobedience.
105518 ^ not therefore be partakers with them.
105523 ^ you were for once darkness;
105527 ^ now however, light in [the] lord;
105532 ^ as children of light walk —
105536 ^ - for
105538 ^ the fruit of the light [is] in all goodness and righteousness and truth —
105548 ^ discerning
105549 ^ what is well-pleasing to the lord.
105554 ^ and not have fellowship with the works - unfruitful - of darkness;
105563 ^ rather however even expose [them];
105567 ^ the things for
105569 ^ in secret being done by them, shameful it is
105575 ^ even to mention.
105577 ^ - but
105579 ^ everything
105580 ^ being exposed by the light is made visible,
105585 ^ everything for
105587 ^ - becoming visible light is.
105591 ^ therefore it says:
105593 ^ awake you,
105594 ^ the [one] sleeping,
105596 ^ and rise up out from the dead,
105601 ^ and will shine upon you - christ.
105606 ^ take heed therefore carefully
105609 ^ how you walk,
105611 ^ not as unwise,
105614 ^ but as wise,
105617 ^ redeeming the time,
105620 ^ because the days evil are.
105625 ^ because of this, not be foolish,
105630 ^ but understand
105632 ^ what the will of the lord [is].
105637 ^ and not to be drunk with wine,
105641 ^ in which is debauchery.
105645 ^ instead be filled with [the] spirit,
105649 ^ speaking to each other in psalms and hymns and songs spiritual,
105658 ^ singing
105659 ^ and making melody in the heart of you to the lord,
105666 ^ giving thanks at all times for all things in [the] name the lord of us jesus christ to the god and father.
105681 ^ be submitting yourselves to one another in reverence of christ:
105686 ^ - wives, to the own husbands,
105691 ^ as to the lord;
105694 ^ for [the] husband is head of the wife,
105700 ^ as also - christ [is the] head of the church,
105707 ^ he himself savior of the body.
105711 ^ but even as the church is subjected - to christ,
105718 ^ so also - wives to the own husbands in everything.
105726 ^ - husbands, love the wives,
105731 ^ just as also - christ loved the church
105738 ^ and himself gave up for her,
105743 ^ so that her he might sanctify,
105746 ^ having cleansed [her] by the washing - of water by [the] word,
105753 ^ so that might present he to himself in glory the church,
105760 ^ not having spot or wrinkle or any of the such things,
105769 ^ but that it would be holy and blameless.
105775 ^ so ought also - husbands
105780 ^ to love the of themselves wives,
105784 ^ as the of themselves bodies.
105788 ^ the [one] loving the of himself wife, himself loves.
105795 ^ no one for at any time the of himself flesh hated,
105802 ^ but he nourishes
105804 ^ and cherishes it,
105807 ^ just as also [does] - christ the church;
105813 ^ for members we are
105816 ^ of the body of him.
105819 ^ because of this, will leave a man his father and - mother
105828 ^ and be joined to the wife of him,
105834 ^ and will be the two into flesh one.”
105841 ^ the mystery this great is;
105846 ^ i however speak as to christ, and as to the church.
105855 ^ however also you - according to individual,
105861 ^ each the of himself wife, so let love
105867 ^ as himself;
105869 ^ - and
105871 ^ the wife
105872 ^ that she may respect the husband.
105876 ^ - children, obey the parents of you in [the] lord;
105884 ^ this for is right.
105888 ^ honor the father of you and - mother,
105895 ^ which is [the] commandment first with a promise,
105901 ^ that well with you it may be,
105905 ^ and you will be long-lived upon the earth.”
105911 ^ and - fathers, not provoke the children of you,
105919 ^ but bring up them in [the] discipline and admonition of [the] lord.
105927 ^ - slaves, obey the according to flesh masters with fear and trembling, in sincerity of the heart of you,

105955 ^ doing the will - of god from [the] heart,
105962 ^ with good will rendering service,
105965 ^ as to the lord

106026 ^ put on the complete armor - of god,
106031 ^ for - to be able you
106035 ^ to stand against the schemes of the devil,
106041 ^ because not is to us the wrestling against blood and flesh,

106270 ^ paul and timothy, servants of christ jesus, to all the saints in christ jesus
106282 ^ - being in philippi, with [the] overseers and deacons:
106290 ^ grace to you
106292 ^ and peace from god father of us and [the] lord jesus christ.
106302 ^ i thank the god of me upon every - remembrance of you,
106311 ^ always in every supplication of me for all of you, with joy the supplication making for the partnership of you in the gospel from the first day until - now,
106338 ^ being persuaded of [the] very thing this,
106341 ^ that
106342 ^ the [one] having begun in you a work good will complete [it] until [the] day of christ jesus.
106353 ^ accordingly, it is right for me
106357 ^ this to feel about all of you,
106362 ^ since - have i in the heart you; in both the chains of me, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel,
106383 ^ fellow partakers with me of grace all you are.
106390 ^ witness for
106392 ^ my - god [is],
106395 ^ how i long after all you in [the] affection of christ jesus.
106403 ^ and this i pray,
106406 ^ that the love of you, yet more and more may abound in knowledge and all discernment,
106420 ^ for - to approve you
106424 ^ the things being excellent,
106426 ^ so that you may be pure and blameless unto [the] day of christ,
106434 ^ being filled with [the] fruit of righteousness that [is] through jesus christ, to [the] glory and praise of god.
106446 ^ to know now you, i want, brothers,
106451 ^ that the things concerning me, really to [the] advancement of the gospel have turned out,
106461 ^ so as for the chains of me clearly known
106466 ^ in christ to have become in all the palace guard, and to the rest all;
106477 ^ and - most of the brothers,
106482 ^ in [the] lord trusting by the chains of me, more abundantly to dare
106490 ^ fearlessly the word to speak.
106494 ^ some indeed even from envy and strife,
106501 ^ some however also from goodwill - christ are proclaiming —
106509 ^ the [ones] indeed out of love,
106513 ^ knowing
106514 ^ that for defense of the gospel i am appointed;
106520 ^ the [ones] however out of selfish ambition - christ are proclaiming, not purely,
106529 ^ supposing
106530 ^ tribulation to add to the chains of me.
106535 ^ what then?
106537 ^ only that in every way, whether in pretext or in truth, christ is proclaimed.
106547 ^ and in this i rejoice.
106551 ^ yes, and i will rejoice.
106554 ^ i know for
106556 ^ that this for me will turn out to deliverance through - your prayer and [the] provision of the spirit of jesus christ, according to the earnest expectation and hope of me
106578 ^ that in nothing i will be ashamed,
106582 ^ but in all boldness, as always also now, will be magnified christ in the body of me, whether by life or by death.
106602 ^ to me for - to live [is] christ,
106607 ^ and
106608 ^ - to die [is] gain.
106611 ^ if [i am] however
106613 ^ - to live in flesh,
106617 ^ this for me [is the] fruit of labor.
106621 ^ and
106622 ^ what shall i choose? not i know!
106626 ^ i am pressed however between the two,
106631 ^ the desire having
106634 ^ for [myself] - to depart
106637 ^ and with christ to be,
106641 ^ very much for
106643 ^ more better;
106645 ^ - but to remain in the flesh [is] more necessary for the sake of you.
106654 ^ and
106655 ^ this having been persuaded of, i know
106658 ^ that i will remain
106660 ^ and will continue with all of you for - your progress and joy of the faith,
106672 ^ so that the boasting of you may abound to christ jesus in me through - my coming again to you.
106689 ^ only worthily of the gospel - of christ conduct yourselves,
106696 ^ so that
106697 ^ whether having come
106699 ^ and having seen you,
106702 ^ or being absent, i might hear the things concerning you,
106708 ^ that you are standing firm in one spirit,
106713 ^ with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel,
106720 ^ and not being frightened in nothing
106725 ^ by those opposing [you],
106728 ^ which is to them a demonstration of destruction;
106733 ^ to you however
106735 ^ of salvation,
106736 ^ and this from god.
106740 ^ for to you it has been granted - concerning christ,
106746 ^ not only - in him
106751 ^ to believe,
106752 ^ but also - concerning him
106757 ^ to suffer,
106758 ^ the same conflict having,
106762 ^ such as you saw in me
106766 ^ and now hear of in me.
106771 ^ if [there is] any therefore
106774 ^ encouragement in christ,
106777 ^ if any comfort of love,
106781 ^ if any fellowship of [the] spirit,
106785 ^ if any affections and compassions,
106790 ^ fulfill my - joy
106794 ^ so that the same you may be minded,
106798 ^ the same love having,
106802 ^ united in soul,
106803 ^ the same thing minding,
106806 ^ nothing according to self-interest or according to vain conceit,
106812 ^ but - in humility one another be esteeming
106817 ^ surpassing themselves,
106819 ^ not the things of themselves each considering,
106824 ^ but also the things of others
106828 ^ each. this let mind be in you
106833 ^ which also in christ jesus [was]:
106838 ^ who
106839 ^ in [the] form of god existing, not something to be grasped considered
106846 ^ - to be equal with god,
106850 ^ but himself emptied,
106853 ^ [the] form of a servant having taken,
106856 ^ in [the] likeness of men having been made.
106860 ^ and
106861 ^ in appearance having been found as a man, he humbled himself,
106867 ^ having become obedient unto death, [the] death even of [the] cross.
106874 ^ therefore also - god him highly exalted,
106880 ^ and granted to him the name - above every name,
106889 ^ that at the name of jesus every knee should bow, in the heavens and on earth and under the earth,
106902 ^ and every tongue should confess
106906 ^ that [is] lord jesus christ, to [the] glory of god [the] father.
106914 ^ therefore, beloved of me,
106917 ^ just as always you have obeyed, not as in the presence of me only, but now much more in the absence
106934 ^ of me,
106935 ^ with fear and trembling - your own salvation work out.
106943 ^ god for is
106946 ^ the [one] working in you
106950 ^ both - to will
106953 ^ and - to work according to [his] good pleasure.
106959 ^ all things do without murmurings and disputings,
106965 ^ so that you may be blameless and innocent, children of god, unblemished in [the] midst of a generation crooked
106976 ^ and perverted,
106978 ^ among whom you shine as lights in [the] world,
106985 ^ [the] word of life holding forth, unto a boast to me in [the] day of christ
106994 ^ that not in vain i did run
106999 ^ nor in vain toil.
107003 ^ but if even i am being poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of the faith of you,
107015 ^ i am glad
107016 ^ and rejoice with all you.
107020 ^ - and
107022 ^ likewise also you be glad
107026 ^ and rejoice with me.
107029 ^ i hope however in [the] lord jesus,
107034 ^ timothy soon to send to you,
107038 ^ that i also may be encouraged,
107041 ^ having known the things concerning you.
107045 ^ no one for i have
107048 ^ like-minded,
107049 ^ who genuinely the things relative to you will care for.
107055 ^ those all for the things of themselves are seeking,
107061 ^ not the things jesus. of christ
107065 ^ - but
107067 ^ the proven worth of him you know,
107070 ^ that as a father [with] a child, with me he has served in the gospel.
107080 ^ him indeed therefore i hope
107084 ^ to send,
107085 ^ when - i shall have seen the things concerning me, immediately.
107092 ^ i am persuaded now in [the] lord
107096 ^ that also i myself soon i will come.
107101 ^ necessary now i esteemed [it],
107104 ^ epaphroditus, the brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier of me, of you now messenger and minister of the need of me, to send to you,
107123 ^ since
107124 ^ longing after he was
107126 ^ all you
107128 ^ and being deeply distressed
107130 ^ because you heard
107132 ^ that he was ill.
107134 ^ and indeed he was sick nearly unto death,
107139 ^ but - god had mercy on him;
107144 ^ not on him now alone,
107148 ^ but also on me,
107151 ^ that not sorrow upon sorrow i should have.
107157 ^ all the more speedily therefore i have sent him,
107161 ^ that
107162 ^ having seen him again, you may rejoice,
107166 ^ and i less anxious might be.
107169 ^ receive therefore him in [the] lord with all joy,
107177 ^ and - such in honor hold,
107182 ^ because for the sake of the work of christ, unto death he came near,
107190 ^ having disregarded [his] life
107193 ^ so that he might fill up the of you deficit
107198 ^ of toward me service.
107202 ^ - finally, brothers of me, rejoice in [the] lord.
107209 ^ the same things to write to you, to me indeed [is] not troublesome;
107217 ^ for you now [is] safe.
107220 ^ beware of the dogs;
107223 ^ beware of the evil workers;
107227 ^ beware of the false circumcision.
107230 ^ we for are the circumcision,
107235 ^ those in [the] spirit of god
107238 ^ worshiping
107239 ^ and glorying in christ jesus,
107244 ^ and not in [the] flesh having put confidence,
107249 ^ though i have confidence even in [the] flesh.
107256 ^ if any thinks
107259 ^ other
107260 ^ to have confidence in [the] flesh,
107263 ^ i more:
107265 ^ circumcision on [the] eighth day; of [the] nation of israel, of [the] tribe of benjamin; a hebrew of hebrews; according to [the] law, a pharisee;
107278 ^ according to zeal, persecuting the church;
107283 ^ according to righteousness
107285 ^ which [is] in [the] law,
107288 ^ having become faultless.
107290 ^ but whatever things were to me gain,
107295 ^ these i have esteemed, because of - christ,
107300 ^ loss.
107301 ^ but -, therefore indeed, also i count
107305 ^ all things loss to be
107308 ^ because of the excelling - knowledge of christ jesus the lord of me,
107318 ^ because of whom - all things i have lost,
107323 ^ and esteem [them] rubbish,
107326 ^ that christ i may gain
107329 ^ and be found in him,
107333 ^ not having my own righteousness, which [is] of [the] law,
107340 ^ but that through faith from christ, the of god righteousness
107349 ^ on the basis of - faith,
107352 ^ - to know him and the power of the resurrection of him, and the fellowship of sufferings of him,
107367 ^ being conformed to the death of him,
107371 ^ if, by any means, i may attain to the resurrection - out from dead.
107380 ^ not that already i have obtained [it],
107384 ^ or already have been perfected;
107387 ^ i am pursuing however,
107389 ^ if also i may lay hold
107392 ^ of that for which also i was laid hold of by christ jesus.
107399 ^ brothers, i
107401 ^ myself not do consider to have taken hold [of it].
107405 ^ one thing however:
107407 ^ the things indeed
107409 ^ behind forgetting,
107411 ^ to the things now
107413 ^ ahead reaching forward, toward [the] goal i press on for the prize of the upward calling - of god in christ jesus.
107429 ^ as many as therefore [are] mature,
107432 ^ this should be of mind;
107434 ^ and if [in] anything differently you are minded,
107439 ^ even this - god to you will reveal.
107445 ^ nevertheless to that which we have attained,
107449 ^ by the same to walk.
107452 ^ imitators together of me be, brothers,
107456 ^ and observe
107458 ^ those thus
107460 ^ walking,
107461 ^ as you have [for] a pattern us.
107465 ^ many for are walking —
107468 ^ [of] whom often i told you,
107472 ^ now indeed
107474 ^ even weeping i say —
107477 ^ - [as] enemies of the cross - of christ,
107483 ^ whose - end [is] destruction,
107487 ^ whose - god [is] the belly,
107492 ^ and - glory [is] in the shame of them,
107499 ^ those things earthly
107502 ^ minding.
107503 ^ of us for
107505 ^ the citizenship in [the] heavens exists,
107510 ^ from whence also a savior we are awaiting,
107515 ^ [the] lord jesus christ,
107518 ^ who will transform the body - of humiliation of us, conformed to the body of the glory of himself, according to the working
107534 ^ - enabling him
107537 ^ even to subdue to himself - all things.
107542 ^ therefore, brothers of me, beloved and longed for, [the] joy and crown of me, in this way stand firm in [the] lord, beloved.
107557 ^ euodia i exhort
107559 ^ and syntyche i exhort,
107562 ^ the same to be of mind in [the] lord.
107567 ^ yes, i ask also you, true yokefellow,
107573 ^ help these [women],
107575 ^ who in the gospel labored together with me, with also clement and the rest of [the] fellow workers of me,
107589 ^ whose - names [are] in [the] book of life.
107595 ^ rejoice in [the] lord always;
107599 ^ again i will say,
107601 ^ rejoice!
107602 ^ the gentleness of you let be known to all men.
107608 ^ the lord [is] near.
107611 ^ nothing be anxious about,
107613 ^ but in everything, by prayer and - supplication, with thanksgiving, the requests of you let be made known to - god.
107630 ^ and the peace - of god
107635 ^ - surpassing all understanding will guard the hearts of you and the minds of you in christ jesus.
107650 ^ - finally, brothers, whatever is true,
107656 ^ whatever venerable,
107658 ^ whatever right,
107660 ^ whatever pure,
107662 ^ whatever lovely,
107664 ^ whatever admirable —
107666 ^ if any excellence
107669 ^ and if any praise —
107673 ^ these things think on.
107675 ^ what also you have learned
107678 ^ and have received
107680 ^ and have heard
107682 ^ and have seen in me,
107686 ^ these things practice;
107688 ^ and the god - of peace will be with you.
107696 ^ i rejoiced however in [the] lord greatly
107701 ^ that now at last you revived
107705 ^ the for me
107708 ^ caring;
107709 ^ wherein which also you were concerned,
107713 ^ you were lacking opportunity however.
107715 ^ not that as to destitution i speak;
107720 ^ i for have learned
107723 ^ in that which i am, content to be.
107728 ^ i know also
107730 ^ [how] to be brought low,
107731 ^ i know also
107733 ^ [how] to abound.
107734 ^ in everything and in all things, i have learned the secret
107740 ^ also to be full
107742 ^ and to hunger,
107744 ^ also to abound
107746 ^ and to be deficient.
107748 ^ [for] all things i have strength
107750 ^ in the [one] strengthening me.
107754 ^ but well you did,
107757 ^ having fellowship in my - affliction.
107761 ^ know now also you, philippians,
107766 ^ that in [the] beginning of the gospel, when i went out from macedonia,
107775 ^ not one with me
107777 ^ church had partnership with regard to the matter of giving and receiving,
107784 ^ if not you alone.
107788 ^ for even in thessalonica, both once and twice, for the needs of me you sent.
107801 ^ not that i seek after the gift,
107806 ^ but i seek after the fruit
107810 ^ - abounding to [the] account of you.
107815 ^ i have however all things
107818 ^ and abound;
107820 ^ i am full,
107821 ^ having received from epaphroditus the things from you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing - to god.
107834 ^ - and
107836 ^ [the] god of me will fill up all [the] needs of you, according to the riches of him in glory in christ jesus.
107851 ^ to now
107853 ^ [the] god and father of us [is] [be] the glory to the ages of the ages. amen.
107865 ^ greet every saint in christ jesus.
107871 ^ greet you, the with me brothers.
107877 ^ greet you, all the saints, especially now those from - caesar's household.
107889 ^ the grace of the lord jesus christ [be] with the spirit of you.
107899 ^ paul an apostle of christ jesus by [the] will of god, and timothy the brother, to the in colossae saints and faithful brothers in christ:
107919 ^ grace to you
107921 ^ and peace from god [the] father of us.
107927 ^ we give thanks to the god [and] father of the lord of us jesus christ,
107936 ^ continually for you praying,
107940 ^ having heard of the faith of you in christ jesus and the love
107950 ^ that you have toward all the saints, because of the hope
107959 ^ - being laid up for you in the heavens,
107965 ^ which you heard of before in the word of truth, the gospel,
107974 ^ the [one] being present unto you,
107978 ^ just as also in all the world it is
107985 ^ bearing fruit
107986 ^ and increasing,
107988 ^ just as also among you,
107992 ^ from the day you heard
107996 ^ and knew the grace - of god in truth,
108004 ^ just as you learned from epaphras, the beloved fellow bond-servant of us,
108012 ^ who is faithful on behalf of us, a servant - of christ,
108020 ^ the [one] also
108022 ^ having made known to us - your love in [the] spirit.
108029 ^ because of this also we
108033 ^ from the day we heard, not cease
108039 ^ for you praying
108042 ^ and asking
108044 ^ that you may be filled with the knowledge of the will of him in all wisdom and understanding spiritual,
108057 ^ to walk worthily of the lord: in all pleasing,
108064 ^ in every work good, bringing forth fruit
108069 ^ and growing in the knowledge - of god,
108075 ^ with all power being strengthened according to the might - glorious of him unto all endurance and patience
108090 ^ with joy, giving thanks to the father,
108095 ^ the [one] having qualified you for the share of the inheritance of the saints in the light,
108108 ^ who has delivered us from the dominion - of darkness
108116 ^ and transferred [us] into the kingdom of the son - beloved of him,
108126 ^ in whom we have - redemption, the forgiveness - of sins.
108135 ^ [he] is [the] image of the god - invisible, [the] firstborn over all creation,
108145 ^ because in him were created - all things in the heavens and upon the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities;
108171 ^ - all things through him and unto him have been created.
108179 ^ and he is before all things,
108184 ^ and - all things in him hold together.
108190 ^ and he is the head of the body, the church,
108199 ^ who is [the] beginning, firstborn out from the dead,
108206 ^ so that might be
108208 ^ in all things he holding preeminence,
108212 ^ because in him was pleased
108216 ^ all the fullness to dwell,
108220 ^ and by him to reconcile - all things to himself,
108228 ^ having made peace by the blood of the cross of him,
108235 ^ through him, whether the things on the earth, or the things in the heavens.
108247 ^ and you, once being
108251 ^ alienated and hostile - in mind in the deeds - evil,
108261 ^ now however he has reconciled [you] in the body of the flesh of him through - death,
108273 ^ to present you holy and unblemished and blameless before him,
108282 ^ if indeed you continue
108285 ^ - in the faith, established and firm,
108290 ^ and
108291 ^ not being moved away from the hope of the gospel
108298 ^ that you have heard,
108300 ^ - having been proclaimed in all creation - under - heaven,
108309 ^ of which have become i paul
108313 ^ a minister.
108314 ^ now i rejoice in the sufferings for you,
108321 ^ and i am filling up that which is lacking of the tribulations - of christ in the flesh of me for the body of him
108337 ^ which is the church,
108341 ^ of which became i
108344 ^ a minister, according to the administration - of god
108350 ^ - having been given me toward you,
108355 ^ to complete the word - of god, the mystery
108362 ^ - having been hidden from the ages and from the generations,
108371 ^ now however having been manifested to the saints of him,
108377 ^ to whom has willed - god
108381 ^ to make known
108382 ^ what [is] the riches of the glory of the mystery this among the gentiles,
108393 ^ which is
108395 ^ christ in you, the hope - of glory,
108402 ^ whom we preach,
108405 ^ admonishing every man
108408 ^ and teaching every man in all wisdom,
108415 ^ so that we may present every man perfect in christ.
108422 ^ unto this also i toil,
108426 ^ striving according to the energy of him
108431 ^ - working in me in power.
108437 ^ i want for you
108440 ^ to know
108441 ^ how great a struggle i am having for you, and those in laodicea,
108450 ^ and as many as not have seen the face of me in [the] flesh,
108459 ^ that may be encouraged the hearts of them,
108464 ^ having been knit together in love, and to all [the] riches of the full assurance - of understanding, to [the] knowledge of the mystery - of god, [which is] christ,
108482 ^ in whom are all the treasures - of wisdom and of knowledge hidden.
108493 ^ this i say
108495 ^ so that no one you might delude by persuasive speech.
108501 ^ if truly indeed in the flesh i am absent,
108507 ^ yet - in spirit with you i am,
108513 ^ rejoicing
108514 ^ and seeing your - good order and the firmness of the in christ faith of you.
108527 ^ just as therefore you have received - christ jesus the lord,
108535 ^ in him walk,
108538 ^ having been rooted
108539 ^ and being built up in him,
108543 ^ and being strengthened in the faith
108547 ^ just as you were taught,
108549 ^ abounding with thanksgiving.
108552 ^ take heed
108553 ^ lest anyone
108555 ^ you there will be - taking captive through - philosophy and empty deceit, according to the tradition - of men, according to the principles of the world and not according to christ.
108579 ^ for in him dwells all the fullness of the deity bodily;
108589 ^ and you are
108591 ^ in him complete,
108594 ^ who is the head of all rule and authority,
108602 ^ in whom also you were circumcised with [the] circumcision made without hands, in the removal of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision - of christ,
108620 ^ having been buried with him in - baptism,
108625 ^ in which also you were raised with [him] through the faith of the working - of god,
108636 ^ the [one] having raised him out from the dead.
108641 ^ and you dead being in the trespasses and in the uncircumcision of the flesh of you,
108654 ^ he made alive together you with him,
108658 ^ having forgiven us all the transgressions,
108663 ^ having blotted out the against us handwriting in the decrees,
108670 ^ which was adverse to us;
108674 ^ and it he has taken out of the way,
108680 ^ having nailed it to the cross.
108684 ^ having disarmed the rulers and the authorities, he made a show [of them] in public,
108693 ^ having triumphed over them in it.
108697 ^ not therefore anyone you let judge in regard to food, or in regard to drink,
108707 ^ or in regard to a feast, or a new moon, or sabbaths,
108715 ^ which are a shadow
108718 ^ the things coming;
108720 ^ the however
108722 ^ body [is] - of christ.
108725 ^ no one you let disqualify,
108728 ^ delighting in humility and [the] worship of the angels,
108735 ^ which he has seen detailing,
108738 ^ vainly being puffed up by the mind of the flesh of him,
108746 ^ and not holding fast to the head,
108751 ^ from whom all the body,
108756 ^ by the joints and ligaments being supplied
108762 ^ and being knit together, increases with the increase - of god.
108769 ^ if you have died with christ away from the principles of the world,
108778 ^ why
108779 ^ as if living in [the] world, do you submit to decrees:
108784 ^ not you should handle!
108786 ^ not you should taste!
108788 ^ not you should touch!
108790 ^ which are
108792 ^ all unto decay with the use, according to the commandments and teachings - of men,
108804 ^ which are
108806 ^ an appearance indeed having
108809 ^ of wisdom, in self-imposed worship and humility and harsh treatment of [the] body,
108817 ^ not of honor a certain, against [the] indulgence of the flesh.
108825 ^ if then you have been raised with - christ,
108830 ^ the things above seek,
108833 ^ where - christ is
108837 ^ at [the] right hand - of god sitting.
108842 ^ the things above set [your] minds on,
108845 ^ not the things on the earth.
108850 ^ you have died for,
108852 ^ and the life of you has been hidden with - christ in - god.
108863 ^ when - christ may be revealed,
108867 ^ the life of you,
108870 ^ then also you with him will appear in glory.
108878 ^ put to death therefore the members which [are] upon the earth: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, desire evil, and - covetousness,
108894 ^ which is idolatry,
108897 ^ because of which things is coming the wrath - of god on the sons of disobedience,
108909 ^ in which also you walked once
108915 ^ when you were living in them.
108919 ^ now however, put off also you - all [these] things: anger, rage, malice, slander, foul language out of the mouth of you.
108935 ^ not do lie to one another,
108939 ^ having put off the old man with the practices of him,
108947 ^ and
108948 ^ having put on the new,
108951 ^ the [one] being renewed in knowledge according to [the] image
108957 ^ of the [one] having created him,
108960 ^ where not there is greek and jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, scythian, slave, free;
108973 ^ but - all and in all christ [is].
108980 ^ put on therefore, as [the] elect - of god, holy
108987 ^ and beloved, hearts of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, [and] patience;
108995 ^ bearing with each other
108997 ^ and forgiving each other.
109000 ^ if anyone against another should have a complaint,
109006 ^ even as also the lord has forgiven you,
109012 ^ so also you.
109015 ^ beyond all now
109018 ^ these, [put on] the love,
109021 ^ which is [the] bond - of perfect unity.
109026 ^ and the peace - from christ let rule in the hearts of you,
109036 ^ to which also you were called in one body.

109518 ^ - of faith and - labor - of love, and the endurance of the hope of the lord of us jesus christ, before the god and father of us,
109541 ^ knowing, brothers
109543 ^ beloved by - god, the election of you,
109550 ^ because the gospel of us not came to you in word only,
109561 ^ but also in power and in [the] spirit holy, and with full assurance much,
109573 ^ just as you know
109575 ^ what we were among you on account of you.
109581 ^ and you imitators of us became,
109586 ^ and of the lord,
109589 ^ having received the word in tribulation much, with [the] joy of [the] spirit holy,
109599 ^ so as for to became you an example

109642 ^ so as for no need to have us
109647 ^ to say anything.
109649 ^ they themselves for concerning us report
109654 ^ what reception we had from you,
109659 ^ and how you turned to - god from - idols,
109668 ^ to serve [the] god
109670 ^ living and true,
109673 ^ and to await the son of him from the heavens,
109681 ^ whom he raised out from the dead, jesus,
109687 ^ the [one] delivering us from the wrath
109693 ^ - coming.
109695 ^ you yourselves for know, brothers, the coming of us - to you
109705 ^ that not in vain has been;
109709 ^ but
109710 ^ having previously suffered
109711 ^ and having been mistreated
109713 ^ just as you know, in philippi, we had boldness in the god of us,
109722 ^ to speak to you the gospel - of god amid much conflict.
109732 ^ - for
109734 ^ the exhortation of us [is] not of error, nor of impurity, nor in trickery;
109745 ^ but just as we have been approved by - god
109751 ^ to be entrusted with the gospel,
109754 ^ so we speak,
109756 ^ not as men
109759 ^ pleasing,
109760 ^ but god,
109762 ^ the [one] examining the hearts of us.
109767 ^ never for at any time with word of flattery were we,
109774 ^ just as you know,
109776 ^ nor with a pretext for greed —
109780 ^ god [is] witness —
109782 ^ nor seeking from men glory, nor from you, nor from others,
109793 ^ [though] having authority
109794 ^ with weight to be, as christ’s apostles.
109800 ^ but we were infants in [the] midst of you,
109806 ^ as if a nursing mother would cherish - her own children.
109813 ^ so yearning over you, we were pleased
109817 ^ to have imparted to you not only the gospel - of god, but also our
109828 ^ own lives,
109830 ^ because beloved to us you have become.
109834 ^ you remember for, brothers, the labor of us and - hardship:
109843 ^ night and day working,
109847 ^ in order - not
109850 ^ to burden anyone of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel - of god.
109860 ^ you [are] witnesses,
109862 ^ and - god,
109865 ^ how holily, and righteously, and blamelessly, toward you,
109872 ^ those believing, we were;
109875 ^ just as you know
109877 ^ how one each of you,
109881 ^ as a father children his own,
109885 ^ exhorting you
109887 ^ and comforting
109889 ^ and charging
109891 ^ unto - to walk you worthily - of god,
109898 ^ who calls you into the of himself kingdom and glory.
109907 ^ and because of this also, we give thanks - to god unceasingly
109916 ^ that,
109917 ^ having received [the] word [by your] hearing from us
109922 ^ - of god, you accepted not [the] word of men,
109928 ^ but even as it is, truly
109932 ^ [the] word of god,
109934 ^ which also works in you
109939 ^ who believe.
109941 ^ you for imitators became, brothers,
109946 ^ of the churches - of god
109950 ^ - being in - judea in christ jesus.
109958 ^ for the same as them, suffered also you from the own countrymen,
109968 ^ as also [did] they from the jews,
109974 ^ who both the lord
109978 ^ having killed,
109979 ^ jesus, and their own prophets,
109983 ^ and us having driven out,
109986 ^ and god not pleasing, and all men [who are] set against,
109994 ^ hindering
109995 ^ us to the gentiles to speak,
109999 ^ that they might be saved,
110001 ^ so as - to fill up their - sins always.
110008 ^ has come now upon them the wrath to the utmost.
110016 ^ we however, brothers,
110019 ^ having been bereaved of you for [the] time of an hour, in face, not in heart, more abundantly were eager
110030 ^ the face of you to see with great desire.
110037 ^ therefore we wanted
110039 ^ to come to you —
110042 ^ i indeed
110044 ^ paul, both once and twice —
110049 ^ and hindered us - satan.
110054 ^ who [is] for our hope, or joy, or crown of boasting?
110063 ^ or [are] not even you, before the lord of us jesus, at - his coming?
110076 ^ you for are the glory of us, and - joy.
110085 ^ therefore
110086 ^ no longer enduring, we thought it best
110089 ^ to be left behind in athens alone,
110093 ^ and we sent timothy, the brother of us and fellow worker - of god in the gospel - of christ,
110108 ^ in order - to strengthen you
110112 ^ and to encourage concerning the faith of you,
110118 ^ that no one
110120 ^ be moved in the tribulations these.
110125 ^ yourselves for you know
110128 ^ that for this we are destined.
110132 ^ and indeed, when with you we were,
110138 ^ we were telling beforehand you
110140 ^ that we are about
110142 ^ to suffer affliction,
110143 ^ just as also it came to pass,
110146 ^ and you know.
110148 ^ because of this i also,
110151 ^ no longer enduring, sent
110154 ^ in order - to know the faith of you,
110160 ^ lest somehow had tempted you
110164 ^ the [one] tempting,
110166 ^ and in vain would be the labor of us.
110173 ^ presently however, having come timothy to us from you,
110181 ^ and having brought good news to us of the faith and the love of you,
110190 ^ and that you have a remembrance of us good always,
110197 ^ longing
110198 ^ us to see,
110200 ^ just as also we you,
110204 ^ because of this we were encouraged, brothers, as to you, in all the distress and tribulation of us, through - your faith.
110221 ^ for now we live,
110224 ^ if you are standing firm in [the] lord.
110229 ^ what for
110231 ^ thanksgiving are we able
110233 ^ - to god to give concerning you in return for all the joy
110242 ^ that we rejoice because of you, before the god of us,
110250 ^ night and day, exceedingly imploring
110255 ^ for [us] - to see your - face
110261 ^ and to supply the things lacking in the faith of you?
110268 ^ himself now
110270 ^ the god and father of us, and the lord of us jesus, may direct the way of us to you.
110286 ^ you now, the lord may make to increase,
110291 ^ and to abound - in love toward one another, and toward all,
110300 ^ just as also we toward you,
110305 ^ in order - to strengthen your - hearts, blameless in holiness before the god and father of us at the coming of the lord of us jesus, with all the saints of him. amen.
110333 ^ finally then, brothers, we implore you
110338 ^ and exhort in [the] lord jesus
110343 ^ that, just as you have received from us
110348 ^ - in what manner
110350 ^ it behooves
110351 ^ you to walk
110353 ^ and to please god,
110356 ^ just as even you walk [now],
110359 ^ so you should abound more.
110362 ^ you know for
110364 ^ what instructions we gave you, through the lord jesus.
110372 ^ this for is [the] will - of god,
110378 ^ the sanctification of you:
110381 ^ to abstain you [are] from - sexual immorality;
110386 ^ to know each of you [how]
110389 ^ the of himself vessel to control in holiness and honor,
110397 ^ not in [the] passion of lust,
110401 ^ as also the gentiles, -
110406 ^ not knowing - god;
110410 ^ - not
110412 ^ to go beyond
110413 ^ and to overreach in the matter, the brother of him,
110421 ^ because avenging [is] [the] lord concerning all these things,
110427 ^ just as also we told before you,
110431 ^ and thoroughly warned.
110433 ^ not for has called us - god to impurity,
110441 ^ but into holiness.
110444 ^ so then,
110445 ^ the [one] rejecting [this], not man disregards,
110450 ^ but - god,
110453 ^ the [one] also
110455 ^ giving the spirit of him - holy to you.
110463 ^ concerning now
110465 ^ - brotherly love, no need you have [for me]
110470 ^ to write to you,
110472 ^ yourselves for
110474 ^ you taught by god are,
110477 ^ in order - to love one another.
110481 ^ and for you are doing this toward all the brothers, the [ones] in all - macedonia.
110494 ^ we exhort however you, brothers,
110498 ^ to abound more and more,
110500 ^ and to strive earnestly
110502 ^ to live quietly
110503 ^ and to attend to the own,
110507 ^ and to work with the own hands of you,
110513 ^ just as you we commanded,
110516 ^ so that you may walk properly toward those outside,
110522 ^ and of no one need may have.
110526 ^ not we do want but
110529 ^ you to be ignorant, brothers,
110532 ^ concerning those having fallen asleep,
110535 ^ so that not you should be grieved,
110538 ^ just as also the rest,
110542 ^ those not
110544 ^ having hope.
110546 ^ if for we believe
110549 ^ that jesus died
110552 ^ and rose again,
110554 ^ so also - god,
110558 ^ those having fallen asleep through - jesus, will bring with him.
110566 ^ this for to you we declare in [the] word of [the] lord,
110573 ^ that we
110575 ^ the living
110577 ^ - remaining, unto the coming of the lord no not shall precede
110587 ^ those having fallen asleep,
110589 ^ because himself the lord with a loud command, with the voice of an archangel, and with [the] trumpet of god, will descend from heaven,
110605 ^ and the dead in christ will rise first.
110612 ^ then we
110614 ^ the living
110616 ^ - remaining, together with them, will be caught away in [the] clouds for [the] meeting of the lord in [the] air;
110630 ^ and so always with [the] lord we will be.
110636 ^ therefore encourage one another with the words these.
110643 ^ concerning now
110645 ^ the times and the seasons, brothers, no need you have
110654 ^ to you to be written.
110656 ^ yourselves for fully you know
110660 ^ that [the] day of [the] lord, as a thief by night, in this manner comes.
110669 ^ for when they might say, peace and security,
110674 ^ then suddenly upon them comes destruction,
110679 ^ as the labor pains
110682 ^ to her in womb
110685 ^ having;
110686 ^ and no not shall they escape.
110690 ^ you however, brothers, not are in darkness,
110697 ^ that the day you like a thief should overtake.
110704 ^ all for
110706 ^ you, sons of light are,
110710 ^ and sons of day.

111461 ^ and hold fast to the traditions
111465 ^ that you were taught,
111467 ^ whether by word,

111569 ^ - and
111571 ^ the lord may direct your - hearts into the love - of god and into the steadfastness - of christ.
111587 ^ we command now you, brothers, in [the] name of the lord of us jesus christ,
111598 ^ are to withdraw you from every brother
111603 ^ idly walking
111605 ^ and not according to the tradition
111610 ^ that you received from us.
111614 ^ yourselves for you know
111617 ^ how it behooves [you]
111619 ^ to imitate us,
111621 ^ because not we were idle among you,
111626 ^ nor without payment bread did we eat from anyone,
111632 ^ but in labor and hardship, night and day working,
111641 ^ in order - not
111644 ^ to be burdensome to any of you,
111647 ^ not that not we have [the] right,
111652 ^ but that ourselves [as] an example we may offer to you,
111658 ^ for - you to imitate us.
111662 ^ even for when we were with you,
111668 ^ this we were commanding you,
111671 ^ that if anyone not is willing
111676 ^ to work,
111677 ^ neither let him eat.
111679 ^ we hear for some
111682 ^ are walking among you idly,
111686 ^ not at all working,
111688 ^ but being busybodies.
111690 ^ to now
111692 ^ such, we warn
111694 ^ and exhort by our lord jesus christ,
111700 ^ so that,
111701 ^ with quietness working, - their own bread they may eat.
111708 ^ you now, brothers, not shall grow weary
111713 ^ [in] well-doing.
111714 ^ if then anyone not obey this instruction of us through the letter,
111725 ^ of this [man] take note
111727 ^ not to mix with him,
111730 ^ so that he may be ashamed.
111732 ^ and yet not as an enemy esteem [him],
111737 ^ but admonish [him] as a brother.
111741 ^ himself now
111743 ^ the lord - of peace may give you - peace through all, in every way.
111756 ^ the lord [be] with all of you.
111761 ^ the greeting - in my own hand — paul,
111767 ^ which is [my] sign in every letter.
111773 ^ in this manner i write.
111775 ^ the grace of the lord of us jesus christ [be] with all of you.
111785 ^ paul, an apostle of christ jesus according to [the] command of god [the] savior of us, and of christ jesus, the hope of us, to timothy, [my] true child in [the] faith:
111805 ^ grace, mercy, [and] peace from god [the] father, and christ jesus, the lord of us.
111817 ^ just as i urged you
111820 ^ to remain in ephesus,
111823 ^ [when] i was going to macedonia,
111826 ^ so that you might warn certain men
111829 ^ not to teach other doctrines,
111831 ^ nor to give heed to myths and genealogies endless,
111837 ^ which speculations bring,
111840 ^ rather than stewardship of god, which [is] in faith.
111847 ^ - and
111849 ^ the goal of [our] instruction is love out of a pure heart and a conscience good and a faith sincere,
111863 ^ from which some, having missed the mark, have turned aside to meaningless discourse,
111869 ^ desiring
111870 ^ to be teachers of the law,
111872 ^ not understanding
111874 ^ neither what they are saying,
111877 ^ nor [that] about which they confidently assert.
111881 ^ we know now
111883 ^ that good [is] the law,
111887 ^ if one it lawfully uses,
111892 ^ knowing this,
111894 ^ that for a righteous [one] law not is enacted,
111899 ^ for [the] lawless however,
111901 ^ and insubordinate, for [the] ungodly and sinful, for [the] unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for slayers of man, for the sexually immoral, homosexuals, enslavers, liars, perjurers,
111918 ^ and if anything other, in the being sound teaching, is opposed to, according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed god,
111934 ^ with which have been entrusted
111936 ^ i. thankfulness i have
111939 ^ for the [one] having strengthened me,
111942 ^ christ jesus the lord of us,
111947 ^ that faithful me he esteemed,
111951 ^ having appointed [me] to service,
111954 ^ - formerly being a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and insolent;
111962 ^ but i was shown mercy,
111964 ^ because
111965 ^ being ignorant, i did [it] in unbelief.
111969 ^ surpassingly increased then the grace of the lord of us, with [the] faith and love, that [are] in christ jesus.
111984 ^ trustworthy [is] the saying
111987 ^ and of full acceptance worthy,
111991 ^ that christ jesus came into the world
111998 ^ sinners to save,
112000 ^ of whom [the] foremost am i.
112004 ^ but because of this, i was shown mercy,
112008 ^ that in me, [the] foremost, might display christ jesus - perfect patience, as a pattern
112020 ^ for those being about
112022 ^ to believe on him, to life eternal.
112028 ^ to now
112030 ^ [the] king of the ages, [the] immortal, invisible, only god, [be] honor and glory, to the ages of the ages.
112045 ^ amen.
112046 ^ this - charge i commit to you, [my] child timothy, according to the
112055 ^ going before as to you prophecies,
112059 ^ that you might war by them the good warfare,
112066 ^ holding faith and a good conscience,
112071 ^ which some,
112073 ^ having cast away, concerning the faith have caused a shipwreck,
112078 ^ among whom are hymenaeus and alexander,
112083 ^ whom i have handed over - to satan
112087 ^ that they may be disciplined
112089 ^ not to blaspheme.
112091 ^ i exhort therefore, first of all,
112095 ^ to be made entreaties, prayers, intercessions, [and] thanksgivings, on behalf of all men, for kings and all
112107 ^ those in authority
112110 ^ being,
112111 ^ so that a tranquil and quiet life we may lead, in all godliness and dignity.
112122 ^ this [is] good and acceptable before the savior of us, god,
112131 ^ who
112132 ^ all men desires
112135 ^ to be saved,
112136 ^ and to [the] knowledge of [the] truth to come.

112153 ^ the [one] having given himself [as] a ransom for all,
112159 ^ the testimony in proper times their own,
112163 ^ in regard to which was appointed i a herald and an apostle —

112172 ^ not i do lie —
112174 ^ a teacher of [the] gentiles, in faith and truth.
112180 ^ i desire therefore
112182 ^ to pray the men in every place,
112188 ^ lifting up holy hands, apart from anger and dissension.
112195 ^ likewise also
112197 ^ women, in apparel respectable, with modesty and self-control, should adorn themselves,
112207 ^ not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or clothing costly,

112262 ^ she will be saved however through - childbearing,
112267 ^ if they abide in faith and love and holiness, with self-restraint.
112277 ^ trustworthy [is] the saying:
112280 ^ if anyone overseership aspires to,
112284 ^ of good a work he is desirous.
112287 ^ it behooves therefore
112289 ^ the overseer above reproach to be,

115444 ^ so that on behalf of you, me he might serve in the chains of the gospel.
115454 ^ apart from however
115456 ^ - your consent, nothing i wished

115608 ^ in many portions and in many ways, long ago - god having spoken to the fathers in the prophets, in last - days these has spoken to us in [his] son,
115629 ^ whom he appointed heir of all things,
115633 ^ through whom also he made the ages,
115639 ^ who
115640 ^ being [the] radiance of [his] glory and [the] exact expression of the substance of him,
115649 ^ upholding then - all things by the word of the power of himself,
115658 ^ [the] purification - of sins having made, sat down at [the] right hand of the majesty on high.
115669 ^ by so much superior having become
115672 ^ to the angels, as much as more excellent beyond theirs, he has inherited
115679 ^ a name.
115680 ^ to which for did he say ever
115684 ^ of the angels:
115686 ^ son of me are you;
115690 ^ i today have begotten you?”
115694 ^ and again:
115696 ^ i will be to him for a father,
115701 ^ and he will be to me for a son?”
115707 ^ when then again he brings the firstborn into the world,
115716 ^ he says:
115717 ^ and let worship him all [the] angels of god.”
115723 ^ and as to indeed
115726 ^ the angels he says:
115729 ^ the [one] making the angels of him winds,
115735 ^ and the ministers of him, of fire a flame.”
115741 ^ unto however
115743 ^ the son:
115745 ^ the throne of you, o god, [is] to the age of the age,
115755 ^ and the scepter of righteousness [is] [the] scepter of the kingdom of you.
115764 ^ you have loved righteousness
115766 ^ and have hated wickedness;
115769 ^ because of this, has anointed you - god, the god of you, with [the] oil of exultation, above the companions of you.”
115784 ^ and: you in [the] beginning, lord, of the earth laid the foundation,
115792 ^ and works of the hands of you are the heavens.
115800 ^ they will perish;
115802 ^ you however remain;
115805 ^ and all like a garment will grow old;
115810 ^ and like a robe you will roll up them,
115815 ^ like a garment also they will be changed;
115819 ^ you however the same are,
115824 ^ and the years of you not will never end.”
115830 ^ to which now
115833 ^ of the angels did he say ever:
115837 ^ sit at [the] right hand of me,
115841 ^ until - i may place the enemies of you [as] a footstool for the feet of you”
115851 ^ not all are they ministering spirits,
115856 ^ for service being sent forth,
115859 ^ for the sake of those being about
115862 ^ to inherit salvation?
115864 ^ because of this, it behooves
115867 ^ more abundantly to give heed us
115870 ^ to the things we have heard,
115872 ^ lest ever we should drift away.
115874 ^ if for the
115877 ^ by angels having been spoken word was unalterable,
115883 ^ and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense,
115891 ^ how we will escape
115894 ^ such a great having neglected
115896 ^ a salvation,
115897 ^ which
115898 ^ a commencement having received,
115900 ^ declared by the lord,
115904 ^ by those having heard, to us it was confirmed,
115910 ^ bearing witness - god by signs together with [them] and wonders, and by various miracles, and of [the] spirit holy distributions, according to the of him will.
115928 ^ not for to angels did he subject the world
115934 ^ that is coming,
115936 ^ of which we are speaking.
115939 ^ has testified however somewhere someone,
115943 ^ saying,
115944 ^ what is man,
115947 ^ that you are mindful of him,
115950 ^ or [the] son of man,
115953 ^ that you care for him?
115956 ^ you made lower him a little some than [the] angels;
115962 ^ with glory and honor you crowned him,
115967 ^ all things you have put in subjection under the feet of him.
115973 ^ in - for subjecting to him - all things, nothing he left to him unsubject.
115984 ^ at present however, not yet do we see to him - all things having been subjected.
115992 ^ who however
115994 ^ a little one than [the] angels, having been made lower, we see,
116000 ^ jesus,
116001 ^ because of the suffering - of death, with glory and with honor having been crowned,
116010 ^ so that by [the] grace of god for everyone he might taste death.
116017 ^ it was fitting for to him,
116020 ^ for whom [are] - all things
116024 ^ and by whom [are] - all things,
116029 ^ many sons to glory having brought, the archetype of the salvation of them, through sufferings to make perfect.
116042 ^ the [one] both for
116045 ^ sanctifying, and
116047 ^ those being sanctified, of one [are] all;
116052 ^ for which reason, not he is ashamed
116057 ^ brothers them to call,
116060 ^ saying:
116061 ^ i will declare the name of you to the brothers of me;
116068 ^ in [the] midst of [the] congregation i will sing praises of you.”
116073 ^ and again:
116075 ^ i will be
116077 ^ trusting in him.”
116080 ^ and again:
116082 ^ behold,
116083 ^ i and the children
116087 ^ whom to me has given - god.”
116092 ^ since therefore the children have partaken of blood and of flesh
116100 ^ also, he likewise took part in the same things,
116106 ^ so that through [his] death, he might destroy the [one]
116112 ^ the power holding
116115 ^ - of death,
116117 ^ that is, the devil,
116121 ^ and might set free those
116124 ^ who fear of death through all
116129 ^ [their time] to live, subject were
116133 ^ to slavery.
116134 ^ not for surely in that place [the] angels he helps,
116139 ^ but [the] seed of abraham he helps.
116143 ^ therefore it behooved [him]
116145 ^ in all things [his] brothers to be made like,
116150 ^ so that a merciful he might become,
116153 ^ and faithful, high priest [in] things relating to - god,
116160 ^ in order - to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
116167 ^ in that for has suffered he himself,
116172 ^ having been tempted,
116173 ^ he is able
116174 ^ those being tempted to help.
116177 ^ therefore, brothers holy, of [the] calling heavenly partakers, carefully consider the apostle and high priest of the confession of us, jesus,
116192 ^ faithful being
116194 ^ to the [one] having appointed him,
116197 ^ as also moses in all the house of him.
116205 ^ of greater for he
116208 ^ glory than moses has been counted worthy,
116212 ^ by so much as greater honor has
116217 ^ than the house [itself],
116219 ^ the [one] having built it.
116222 ^ every for
116224 ^ house is built by someone;
116228 ^ the [one] however everything having built [is] god.
116233 ^ and moses indeed [was] faithful in all the house of him as a servant, unto a testimony
116246 ^ of the things going to be spoken;
116248 ^ christ however as [the] son over the house of him,
116256 ^ whose house are we,
116260 ^ if indeed [our] confidence, and the boast of [our] hope, we should hold.
116269 ^ therefore, just as says the spirit - holy:
116276 ^ today if the voice of him you should hear,
116282 ^ not harden the hearts of you,
116287 ^ as in the rebellion, in the day - of testing in the wilderness,
116299 ^ where tried [me] the fathers of you by testing,
116306 ^ and saw the works of me forty years.
116313 ^ therefore i was angry with the generation that,
116318 ^ and i said,
116320 ^ always they go astray - in the heart
116324 ^ of them; and not have they known the ways of me;
116331 ^ so i swore in the wrath of me,
116337 ^ [not] shall they enter into the rest of me.’”
116343 ^ take heed, brothers,
116345 ^ lest ever there will be in any of you a heart evil of unbelief,
116353 ^ into - falling away from god
116358 ^ [the] living.
116359 ^ but encourage other each every day,
116365 ^ while - - today it is called,
116370 ^ so that not may be hardened one of you by [the] deceitfulness - of sin.
116379 ^ partakers for
116381 ^ - of christ we have become,
116384 ^ if indeed from the beginning the assurance unto [the] end firm we should hold.
116393 ^ as - it is said:
116396 ^ today if the voice of him you should hear,
116402 ^ not harden the hearts of you,
116407 ^ as in the rebellion.”
116411 ^ who for
116413 ^ [were those] having heard, rebelled,
116415 ^ but not
116417 ^ all those having come out of egypt by the leading of moses?
116424 ^ with whom now was he indignant forty years,
116429 ^ [if] not
116430 ^ with those having sinned,
116432 ^ whose - bodies fell in the wilderness?
116439 ^ to whom then did he swear that
116442 ^ not shall they enter into the rest of him,
116448 ^ if not
116450 ^ to those having disobeyed?
116452 ^ and we see
116454 ^ that not they were able
116457 ^ to enter in because of unbelief.
116460 ^ we should fear therefore,
116462 ^ lest ever
116463 ^ left remaining, of the promise
116465 ^ to enter into the rest of him, should seem any of you
116474 ^ to have fallen short.
116475 ^ and for we are [those]
116478 ^ having had the gospel preached
116479 ^ just as they [did];
116481 ^ but not did profit the message of [their] hearing them,
116489 ^ not having been united with the faith
116493 ^ of those having heard.
116495 ^ we enter for into the rest,
116500 ^ those having believed;
116502 ^ as he has said:
116504 ^ so i swore in the wrath of me,
116510 ^ not shall they enter into the rest of me.’”
116516 ^ and yet the works from [the] foundation of [the] world have been finished.
116523 ^ he has spoken for somewhere concerning the seventh [day]
116529 ^ in this way, and rested - god on the day - seventh from all the works of him.”
116544 ^ and in this [passage] again,
116548 ^ [not] shall they enter into the rest of me.
116554 ^ since therefore it remains [for]
116557 ^ some to enter into it,
116561 ^ and
116562 ^ those formerly
116564 ^ having received the good news, not did enter in because of disobedience,
116569 ^ again a certain he appoints
116572 ^ day today,
116574 ^ through david saying after so long a time,
116580 ^ just as it has been said,
116582 ^ today, if the voice of him you shall hear,
116588 ^ not harden the hearts of you.”
116593 ^ if for to them joshua had given rest,
116598 ^ not - about another he would have spoken after this day.
116606 ^ so then there remains a sabbath rest for the people - of god.
116613 ^ the [one] for
116615 ^ having entered into the rest of him, also he rested from the works of him,
116627 ^ as from the own - god [did].
116633 ^ we should be diligent therefore
116635 ^ to enter into that - rest,
116640 ^ so that not by the same anyone
116646 ^ example should fall
116648 ^ - of disobedience.
116650 ^ living [is] for the word - of god,
116656 ^ and active, and sharper than any sword two-edged, even
116665 ^ penetrating as far as [the] division of soul and spirit, of joints and also marrows, and able to judge [the] thoughts and intentions of [the] heart.
116681 ^ and not there is creature hidden before him;
116688 ^ all things however [are] uncovered and
116692 ^ laid bare to the eyes of him
116696 ^ to whom [is] our - reckoning.
116701 ^ having therefore a high priest great,
116705 ^ having passed through the heavens, jesus, the son - of god, we should hold firmly to [our] confession.
116716 ^ not for have we a high priest
116720 ^ not being able
116722 ^ to sympathize with the weaknesses of us;
116726 ^ [one] having been tempted however in all things by the same way, without sin.
116734 ^ we should come therefore with boldness to the throne - of grace,
116742 ^ so that we may receive mercy
116745 ^ and grace may find for in time of need help.
116751 ^ every for
116753 ^ high priest,
116754 ^ from among men being taken, on behalf of men is appointed, in things relating to - god
116764 ^ that he should offer gifts both and sacrifices for sins,
116772 ^ to exercise forbearance being able, with those being ignorant and
116777 ^ going astray,
116778 ^ since also he himself is encompassed by weakness;
116783 ^ and because of this he is obligated,
116787 ^ just as for the people, so also for himself, to offer sacrifices for sins.
116798 ^ and not upon himself anyone takes the honor,
116805 ^ but rather
116806 ^ being called by - god,
116810 ^ just as also aaron.
116813 ^ so also - christ not himself did glorify
116820 ^ to become a high priest,
116822 ^ but
116823 ^ the [one] having said to him:
116827 ^ son of me are you,
116831 ^ i today have begotten you.”
116835 ^ just as also in another [place] he says:
116840 ^ you [are] a priest to the age, according to the order of melchizedek.”
116849 ^ [he]
116850 ^ in the days of the flesh of him, prayers both and supplications,
116860 ^ to the [one] being able
116863 ^ to save him from death, with crying loud and tears having offered up,
116873 ^ and
116874 ^ having been heard, because of - reverence,
116878 ^ though being a son,
116881 ^ he learned
116882 ^ from the things he suffered, - obedience,
116887 ^ and
116888 ^ having been perfected, he became
116890 ^ to all those obeying him, [the] author
116895 ^ of salvation eternal,
116897 ^ having been designated by - god a high priest according to the order of melchizedek.
116906 ^ concerning this [there is] much from us - speech,
116912 ^ and difficult in interpretation
116914 ^ to speak,
116915 ^ since sluggish you have become
116918 ^ in the hearings.
116920 ^ even for
116922 ^ you ought
116923 ^ to be teachers by the time, again need of you have
116931 ^ [one] to teach you what [is] the principles of the beginning of the oracles - of god;
116943 ^ and you have become
116945 ^ need [those] having
116947 ^ of milk,
116948 ^ and not of solid food.
116952 ^ everyone for - partaking [only] of milk [is] inexperienced in [the] word of righteousness;
116960 ^ an infant for he is;
116963 ^ [for the] mature however is - solid food,
116969 ^ the [ones] by - constant use the senses
116975 ^ training
116976 ^ having
116977 ^ for distinguishing good both and evil.
116983 ^ therefore,
116984 ^ having left the - beginning of the christ teaching, to - maturity we should go on,
116995 ^ not again a foundation laying
116999 ^ of repentance from dead works, and faith in god, about baptisms instruction, of laying on then of hands, of [the] resurrection both of [the] dead and of judgment eternal.
117018 ^ and this we will do,
117021 ^ if permits - god.
117025 ^ [it is] impossible for
117027 ^ to those once
117029 ^ having been enlightened,
117030 ^ having tasted then of the gift - heavenly,
117036 ^ and partakers having become
117039 ^ of [the] spirit holy,
117041 ^ and [the] goodness having tasted
117044 ^ of god’s word, [the] power also
117048 ^ [of the] coming age —
117050 ^ and then having fallen away — again to restore [them] to repentance,
117056 ^ crucifying in themselves the son - of god
117062 ^ and subjecting [him] to open shame.
117064 ^ land for
117066 ^ - having drunk in the
117069 ^ upon it coming often rain,
117074 ^ and producing vegetation useful for those
117079 ^ for the sake of whom also it is tilled, partakes of blessing from - god.
117088 ^ [that] bringing forth however thorns and thistles [is] worthless and a curse near to,
117097 ^ of which the end [is] unto burning.
117102 ^ we are persuaded however concerning you, beloved, of better [things], and
117110 ^ [things] accompanying salvation,
117112 ^ if even like this we speak.
117116 ^ not for unjust [is] - god,
117121 ^ to forget the work of you and the love
117128 ^ that you have shown toward the name of him,
117134 ^ having ministered to the saints
117137 ^ and [still] ministering.
117139 ^ we desire now, each of you
117143 ^ the same to show,
117146 ^ earnestness, toward the full assurance of the hope unto [the] end,
117154 ^ so that not sluggish you may be,
117158 ^ imitators however
117160 ^ of those through faith and patience
117165 ^ inheriting the promises.
117168 ^ - for to abraham having made his promise, - god,
117174 ^ since
117175 ^ by no one he had greater to swear, he swore by himself,
117183 ^ saying,
117184 ^ if surely
117186 ^ blessing i will bless you,
117189 ^ and
117190 ^ multiplying i will multiply you.”
117193 ^ and thus
117195 ^ having waited patiently, he obtained the promise.
117199 ^ men for by [one] greater swear,
117205 ^ and of all their disputes an end, for confirmation, [is] the oath,
117214 ^ in which
117216 ^ more abundantly desiring - god
117220 ^ to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of the purpose of him, guaranteed [it] by an oath,
117232 ^ so that by two things unchangeable,
117237 ^ in which [it is] impossible
117240 ^ to lie - [for] god, strong encouragement we may have,
117246 ^ - having fled for refuge,
117248 ^ to take hold of the
117250 ^ being set before [us] hope,
117252 ^ which as an anchor we have
117256 ^ of the soul, sure both and unshakable and
117263 ^ entering into that within the veil,
117269 ^ where [the] forerunner for us has entered,
117274 ^ jesus,
117275 ^ according to the order of melchizedek, a high priest having become to the age.
117284 ^ this for
117286 ^ - melchizedek, king of salem, priest - of god - most high,
117295 ^ - having met abraham
117298 ^ returning from the slaughter of the kings
117304 ^ and having blessed him,
117307 ^ [is he] to whom also a tenth of all apportioned abraham, first indeed
117316 ^ being translated, king of righteousness;
117319 ^ then and also, king of salem,
117324 ^ which is, king of peace.
117328 ^ without father, without mother, without genealogy,
117331 ^ neither beginning of days nor of life end having,
117338 ^ having been made like however the son - of god, he remains a priest unto - all time.
117349 ^ consider now
117351 ^ how great this one [was],
117353 ^ to whom even a tenth abraham gave out of the best spoils,
117361 ^ the patriarch.
117363 ^ and
117364 ^ those indeed, out from the sons of levi, the priestly office receiving, a commandment have
117375 ^ to take a tenth from the people according to the law,
117381 ^ that is, from the brothers of them,
117386 ^ though having come out of the loin of abraham.
117392 ^ the [one] however not tracing his ancestry from them has collected a tenth from abraham,
117400 ^ and
117401 ^ the [one] having the promises has blessed.
117406 ^ apart from now
117408 ^ all dispute, the inferior by the superior is blessed.
117416 ^ and here indeed tithes,
117420 ^ dying men receive;
117423 ^ in that place however,
117425 ^ it is testified
117426 ^ that he lives on.
117428 ^ and
117429 ^ so, a word
117431 ^ to speak, through abraham also, levi,
117436 ^ the [one] tithes
117438 ^ receiving, paid the tithe.
117440 ^ still for in the loin of [his] father he was,
117448 ^ when met him melchizedek.
117452 ^ if indeed then perfection by the levitical priesthood were —
117461 ^ the people for upon it had received [the] law —
117467 ^ what still need [was there],
117470 ^ according to the order of melchizedek, [for] another to arise
117476 ^ priest
117477 ^ and not according to the order of aaron to be named?
117484 ^ being changed for of the priesthood,
117488 ^ from necessity also, of law a change takes place.
117494 ^ [he] concerning whom for are said these things a tribe another belonged to,
117502 ^ from which no one has served at the altar.
117508 ^ [it is] evident for
117510 ^ that out of judah has sprung the lord of us,
117517 ^ as to which a tribe, concerning priests, nothing moses spoke.
117525 ^ and more abundantly yet evident it is,
117530 ^ if according to the likeness of melchizedek arises a priest another,
117538 ^ who not according to a law of a commandment fleshly has been constituted,
117545 ^ but according to [the] power of a life indestructible.
117550 ^ it is testified for
117552 ^ -: you [are] a priest to the age, according to the order of melchizedek.”
117562 ^ a putting away indeed for there is
117566 ^ of the preceding commandment, because of - its weakness and uselessness —
117574 ^ nothing for perfected the law —
117579 ^ [the] introduction then
117581 ^ of a better hope,
117583 ^ by which we draw near - to god.
117588 ^ and to as much as not apart from an oath,
117594 ^ those ones truly for
117597 ^ without an oath are priests becoming,
117602 ^ [he] however with an oath,
117606 ^ through the [one] saying to him:
117611 ^ has sworn [the] lord,
117613 ^ and not will change his mind,
117616 ^ you [are] a priest to the age.’”
117621 ^ by so much also of a better covenant has become
117627 ^ [the] guarantee jesus.
117629 ^ and those indeed many are
117634 ^ having become priests,
117636 ^ because of - by death
117639 ^ being prevented from
117640 ^ continuing.
117641 ^ - but
117643 ^ because of the abiding of him to the age, a permanent he holds - priesthood,
117654 ^ wherefore also,
117656 ^ to save to the uttermost he is able,
117661 ^ those drawing near through him - to god,
117667 ^ always living
117669 ^ for - to intercede for them.
117674 ^ such indeed for us also was fitting
117679 ^ a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled,
117683 ^ having been separated from - sinners,
117687 ^ and higher than the heavens having become,
117692 ^ who not has every day need,
117698 ^ as the high priests, first for the own sins, sacrifices to offer up,
117708 ^ then for those of the people;
117712 ^ this for he did once for all,
117716 ^ himself having offered up.
117718 ^ the law for men appoints as high priests,
117724 ^ having weakness;
117726 ^ the word however
117729 ^ of the oath, which [is] after the law, a son
117736 ^ to the age, having been perfected.
117740 ^ [the] sum now
117742 ^ of the things being spoken of [is that]
117745 ^ such we have,
117747 ^ a high priest
117748 ^ who sat down at [the] right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens,
117759 ^ in the holy places a minister,
117762 ^ and in the tabernacle - true,
117767 ^ which has pitched the lord,
117771 ^ not man.
117773 ^ every for
117775 ^ high priest,
117776 ^ in order - to offer gifts both, and sacrifices, is appointed;
117784 ^ wherefore [it was] necessary
117786 ^ to have something also [for] this one
117790 ^ that he might offer.
117792 ^ if certainly then he were on earth,
117798 ^ not even - would he be a priest,
117802 ^ there being
117803 ^ those offering according to law the gifts,
117809 ^ who a copy and shadow serve
117814 ^ of the heavenly,
117816 ^ as was divinely instructed moses,
117819 ^ being about
117820 ^ to complete the tabernacle.
117823 ^ see that,” for
117825 ^ he says,
117826 ^ you shall make all things according to the pattern
117831 ^ - having been shown you in the mountain.”
117837 ^ now, however, more excellent he has obtained
117841 ^ a ministry,
117842 ^ as much as also of a better he is
117846 ^ covenant [the] mediator,
117848 ^ which upon better promises has been enacted.
117853 ^ if for the first that had been faultless,
117860 ^ not - for a second would have been sought
117864 ^ a place.
117865 ^ finding fault for with them, he says:
117869 ^ behold,
117870 ^ [the] days are coming,
117872 ^ says [the] lord,
117874 ^ and i will ratify with the house of israel and with the house of judah, a covenant new,
117887 ^ not according to the covenant
117891 ^ that i made with fathers of them, in [the] day
117898 ^ of having taken hold of by me the hand of them,
117903 ^ to lead them out of [the] land of egypt,
117908 ^ because they not did continue in the covenant of me,
117916 ^ and i disregarded them,
117919 ^ says [the] lord.
117921 ^ for this [is] the covenant
117925 ^ that i will make with the house of israel, after the days those,
117934 ^ says [the] lord,
117936 ^ putting laws of me into the mind of them,
117943 ^ and upon hearts of them i will inscribe them;
117949 ^ and i will be to them for god,
117954 ^ and they will be to me for a people.
117960 ^ and no not shall they teach each the neighbor of him,
117968 ^ and each the brother of him
117973 ^ saying,
117974 ^ know the lord,’
117977 ^ because all will know me,
117981 ^ from [the] least to [the] greatest of them,
117986 ^ because merciful i will be
117989 ^ toward the iniquities of them,
117992 ^ and the sins of them no not i shall remember more.
118000 ^ in - saying, new, he has made obsolete the first;
118007 ^ that then
118009 ^ growing old
118010 ^ and aging [is] near vanishing.
118014 ^ had indeed therefore also the first, regulations of worship - and a sanctuary earthly.
118026 ^ a tabernacle for was prepared,
118029 ^ the first [room] —
118031 ^ in which [were] - both the lampstand, and the table, and of the presentation the bread —
118044 ^ which is called [the] holy [place].
118047 ^ behind now
118049 ^ the second veil [was] a tabernacle,
118053 ^ - being called the holy of holies,
118057 ^ [the] golden having
118059 ^ altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant,
118065 ^ having been covered around in every part with gold,
118068 ^ in which [was the] jar golden
118072 ^ having the manna, and the staff of aaron
118079 ^ - having budded, and the tablets of the covenant. above then it [were the] cherubim of glory,
118091 ^ overshadowing the mercy seat;
118094 ^ concerning which not it is now [the time]
118099 ^ to speak in detail.
118102 ^ these things now thus having been prepared,
118106 ^ into indeed
118108 ^ the first tabernacle at all times everything enter the priests,
118116 ^ the sacred services accomplishing.
118119 ^ [enters] into however
118121 ^ the second, once in the year only, the high priest,
118129 ^ not without blood,
118132 ^ which he offers for himself and the of the people sins of ignorance.
118141 ^ by this was signifying the spirit - holy
118147 ^ [that] not yet has been made manifest the into the holy places way,
118153 ^ still the first tabernacle having a standing,
118159 ^ which [is] a symbol for the time
118164 ^ - present,
118166 ^ in which gifts both and sacrifices are offered,
118173 ^ not being able
118175 ^ in regard to conscience to make perfect
118178 ^ the [one] worshiping, [consisting] only in foods and drinks and various washings, ordinances of [the] flesh,
118190 ^ until [the] time of reformation being imposed.
118194 ^ christ however,
118196 ^ having appeared as high priest of the having come good things, by the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made by hands,
118209 ^ that is, not of this - creation,
118215 ^ nor by blood of goats and calves, through however
118223 ^ the own blood, he entered once for all into the holy places,
118231 ^ eternal redemption having obtained.
118234 ^ if for the blood of goats, and of bulls, and [the] ashes of a heifer,
118244 ^ sprinkling
118245 ^ the having been defiled, sanctify [them] for the of the flesh purification,
118253 ^ how much more the blood - of christ,
118259 ^ who through [the] spirit eternal, himself offered unblemished - to god, will purify the conscience of us from dead works,
118275 ^ in order - to serve god
118279 ^ [the] living!
118280 ^ and because of this, of a covenant new [the] mediator he is,
118287 ^ so that,
118288 ^ death having taken place, for redemption of the under the first covenant transgressions, the promise might receive
118301 ^ those having been called,
118303 ^ of the eternal inheritance.
118306 ^ where for [there is] a will,
118309 ^ [the] death [it is] necessary to establish
118312 ^ of the [one] having made [it].
118314 ^ a will for after death [is] affirmed,
118319 ^ since not at the time it is in force,
118322 ^ when is living
118324 ^ the [one] having made [it],
118326 ^ wherefore neither the first, apart from blood has been inaugurated.
118333 ^ having been spoken for of every commandment according to the law by moses to all the people,
118345 ^ having taken the blood - of calves and - of goats, with water, and wool scarlet, and hyssop, itself both the book and all the people he sprinkled,
118369 ^ saying,
118370 ^ this [is] the blood of the covenant,
118375 ^ which commanded unto you - god.”
118381 ^ and the tabernacle then,
118385 ^ and all the vessels of the ministry with blood likewise he sprinkled.
118395 ^ and almost with blood all things are purified, according to the law,
118404 ^ and apart from blood-shedding, not there is forgiveness.
118410 ^ [it was] necessary then [for]
118412 ^ the indeed
118414 ^ representations of the things in the heavens, with these to be purified,
118421 ^ themselves however
118423 ^ the heavenly things with better sacrifices than these.
118429 ^ not for into made by hands has entered
118434 ^ holy places christ,
118436 ^ copies of the true [ones],
118439 ^ but into itself - heaven,
118444 ^ now to appear in the presence - of god for us,
118452 ^ nor that repeatedly he should offer himself,
118457 ^ just as the high priest enters into the holy places every year with [the] blood of another.
118469 ^ otherwise it was necessary for
118471 ^ him repeatedly to have suffered from [the] foundation of [the] world.
118477 ^ now however once in [the] consummation of the ages, for [the] putting away of sin, by the sacrifice of himself he has been revealed.
118493 ^ and in as much as it is apportioned - to men
118499 ^ once to die,
118501 ^ after then
118503 ^ this [to face] judgment,
118505 ^ so also - christ,
118509 ^ once having been offered
118511 ^ in order - of many
118514 ^ to bear
118515 ^ [the] sins, for a second time, apart from sin, will appear
118521 ^ to those him
118523 ^ awaiting for salvation.
118526 ^ a shadow for
118528 ^ having the law
118531 ^ of the
118532 ^ coming good things,
118534 ^ not themselves the form of the things, each year with the same sacrifices,
118545 ^ which they offer to the continuous, never is able
118552 ^ those drawing near to perfect.
118555 ^ otherwise not - would they have ceased
118559 ^ being offered,
118560 ^ because of - none
118563 ^ having any longer
118565 ^ conscience of sins,
118567 ^ those serving
118569 ^ once having been cleansed?
118571 ^ but in these, [there is] a reminder of sins every year.
118578 ^ impossible [it is] indeed [for the] blood of bulls and of goats
118584 ^ to take away sins.
118586 ^ therefore
118587 ^ coming into the world, he says:
118592 ^ sacrifice and offering not you have desired,
118597 ^ a body however you have prepared me.
118601 ^ burnt offerings and [offerings] for sin not you have delighted in.
118607 ^ then i said,
118609 ^ behold,
118610 ^ i have come —
118611 ^ in [the] scroll of [the] book it is written of me —
118617 ^ - to do, - o god, the will of you.’”
118624 ^ above saying
118626 ^ -, sacrifice, and offering, and burnt offerings, and [offerings] for sin, not you have desired,
118637 ^ nor have you delighted in,”
118639 ^ which according to [the] law are offered; then he said,
118645 ^ behold,
118646 ^ i have come
118647 ^ - to do the will of you.
118652 ^ he takes away the first,
118655 ^ that the second he might establish.
118659 ^ by that will,
118662 ^ having been sanctified we are, through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all.
118672 ^ and every indeed
118675 ^ priest stands every day
118679 ^ ministering,
118680 ^ and the same repeatedly offering
118685 ^ sacrifices,
118686 ^ which never are able
118689 ^ to take away sins.
118691 ^ this [one] however,
118693 ^ one for sins having offered
118697 ^ sacrifice in - perpetuity, sat down at [the] right hand - of god,
118706 ^ the henceforth
118708 ^ awaiting
118709 ^ until should be placed the enemies of him [as] a footstool for the feet of him.
118718 ^ by one for
118720 ^ offering, he has perfected for - all time
118725 ^ those being sanctified.
118727 ^ bears witness now to us also the spirit - holy;
118735 ^ after for
118737 ^ - having said:

118803 ^ and living, through the veil,
118808 ^ that is, the flesh of him, and [having] a priest great over the house - of god, we should draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith,
118828 ^ having been sprinkled clean [our] hearts from a conscience evil,
118834 ^ and having been washed [our] body with water pure.
118840 ^ we should hold fast to the confession of [our] hope, firmly;
118846 ^ faithful for [is]

118881 ^ after [we are] - to receive the knowledge of the truth,
118888 ^ no longer for sins remains a sacrifice,
118893 ^ terrifying however

119566 ^ those having disobeyed,
119568 ^ having received the spies with peace.
119573 ^ and what more shall i say?
119577 ^ will fail me for

119595 ^ who by faith conquered kingdoms,
119600 ^ administered justice,
119602 ^ obtained promises;

119720 ^ every, and the easily entangling sin, with endurance should run the
119729 ^ lying before us race,

119744 ^ lying before him joy, endured [the] cross,
119749 ^ [its] shame having despised,
119751 ^ at right hand and
119754 ^ of the throne - of god sat down.
119759 ^ consider fully for,
119761 ^ the [one] such great
119763 ^ having endured from - sinners against himself
119769 ^ hostility,
119770 ^ so that not you shall grow weary, in the souls of you
119776 ^ fainting.
119777 ^ not yet unto blood have you resisted,
119781 ^ against - sin struggling,
119785 ^ and you have forgotten the exhortation
119789 ^ that you as to sons addresses:
119794 ^ son of me, not regard lightly [the] discipline of [the] lord,
119800 ^ nor faint,
119802 ^ by him being reproved.
119805 ^ whom for he loves, [the] lord disciplines;
119810 ^ he scourges now every son
119814 ^ whom he receives.
119816 ^ as discipline endure,
119819 ^ as sons you is treating - god;
119825 ^ what for son [is there]
119828 ^ whom not disciplines [his] father?
119832 ^ if however without you are
119836 ^ of discipline,
119837 ^ of which partakers they have become all,
119841 ^ then illegitimate children
119843 ^ and not sons you are.
119847 ^ furthermore - indeed
119850 ^ of the flesh of us fathers we have had correctors,
119856 ^ and we respected [them];
119858 ^ not much and
119861 ^ more shall we be in subjection to the father - of spirits,
119867 ^ and shall live?
119869 ^ - truly indeed for a few days,
119875 ^ according to that seeming good to them, they were disciplining [us];
119880 ^ - but [he] for [our] benefitting,
119885 ^ in order - to share of the holiness of him.
119891 ^ all now
119893 ^ discipline,
119894 ^ for indeed those being present, not seems
119900 ^ of joy to be,
119902 ^ but of grief;
119904 ^ afterward however, [the] fruit peaceable,
119908 ^ to those by it
119911 ^ having been trained, it yields
119913 ^ of righteousness.
119914 ^ therefore the
119916 ^ drooping hands and the
119920 ^ enfeebled knees lift up,
119923 ^ and paths straight make for the feet of you,
119930 ^ so that not the lame should be put out of joint,
119935 ^ should be healed however rather.
119938 ^ peace pursue with all,
119942 ^ and - holiness,
119945 ^ which without no one will see the lord,
119951 ^ observing
119952 ^ lest any be failing of the grace - of god,
119960 ^ lest any root of bitterness
119964 ^ up springing should trouble [you],
119967 ^ and by this, might be defiled many,
119972 ^ lest [there be] any fornicator or profane person, as esau,
119979 ^ who for meal one sold the birthright of himself.
119987 ^ you know for
119989 ^ that even
119991 ^ afterward, wishing
119993 ^ to inherit the blessing, he was rejected;
119997 ^ of repentance for
119999 ^ place not he found,
120002 ^ although with tears having earnestly sought it.
120007 ^ not for you have come to
120010 ^ [that] being touched and
120012 ^ having been kindled with fire, and to darkness, and to gloom, and to storm, and of a trumpet to [the] sound, and to a voice of words,
120026 ^ which those having heard excused themselves,
120030 ^ [asking] not to be addressed to them [the] word,
120034 ^ not they could bear for
120037 ^ that being commanded:
120039 ^ if even a beast should touch the mountain,
120044 ^ it shall be stoned.”
120045 ^ and so fearful was
120049 ^ the thing appearing [that]
120051 ^ moses said,
120053 ^ greatly afraid i am,
120055 ^ and trembling.”
120057 ^ but you have come to zion mount, and [the] city of god

120084 ^ having been perfected, and of a covenant new [the] mediator, to jesus, and to [the] blood of sprinkling
120093 ^ better things speaking
120095 ^ than that of abel.
120098 ^ take heed
120099 ^ lest you refuse
120101 ^ the [one] speaking.
120103 ^ if for they not escaped,
120108 ^ on earth having refused the [one] divinely instructing [them],
120113 ^ much less we
120116 ^ - the [one] from [the] heavens
120120 ^ turning away from,
120121 ^ whose - voice the earth shook at that time;
120128 ^ now however he has promised,
120131 ^ saying,
120132 ^ yet once [more] i will shake not only the earth,
120140 ^ but also - heaven.”
120144 ^ this now,
120146 ^ yet once [more], signifies the
120150 ^ of the [things] being shaken removing,
120153 ^ as having been created,
120155 ^ so that should remain
120157 ^ the things not
120159 ^ being shaken.
120160 ^ therefore
120161 ^ a kingdom not to be shaken receiving, we may have grace,
120166 ^ by which we may serve well pleasingly - god, with reverence and awe.
120176 ^ also for the god of us [is] a fire
120182 ^ consuming.
120183 ^ - brotherly love let abide.
120186 ^ - of hospitality not be forgetful;

120278 ^ jesus christ yesterday and today [is] the same,
120285 ^ and to the ages.
120289 ^ by teachings various and strange, not be carried away;
120295 ^ [it is] good for
120297 ^ by grace to be strengthened for the heart,
120301 ^ not foods,
120303 ^ in which not were profited those being devoted.
120309 ^ we have an altar
120311 ^ from which to eat, not have

120321 ^ whose for is brought
120324 ^ of animals the blood [as sacrifices] for sin, into the holy places by the high priest;

120342 ^ therefore also jesus,
120345 ^ so that he might sanctify by the own blood the people, outside the gate suffered.
120357 ^ therefore we should go forth to him outside the camp,
120364 ^ the reproach of him bearing.
120368 ^ not for we have here
120372 ^ an abiding city,
120374 ^ but
120375 ^ the coming [one] we are seeking for.

120392 ^ confessing the name of him.
120396 ^ - and

120561 ^ james, of god and of [the] lord jesus christ a servant, to the twelve tribes - in the dispersion:
120575 ^ greetings.
120576 ^ all joy esteem [it], brothers of me,
120581 ^ when trials you might fall into
120584 ^ various,
120585 ^ knowing
120586 ^ that the testing of your - faith produces endurance.
120594 ^ - and
120596 ^ endurance, work [its] perfect let have,
120600 ^ so that you may be perfect and complete,
120605 ^ in nothing lacking.
120608 ^ if now any of you lacks wisdom,
120614 ^ let him ask from the [one]
120617 ^ giving, god,
120619 ^ to all generously,
120621 ^ and not finding fault,
120624 ^ and it will be given to him.
120627 ^ let him ask however in faith,
120631 ^ nothing doubting.
120633 ^ the [one] for doubting is like a wave of [the] sea,
120639 ^ being blown by the wind
120640 ^ and being tossed by the wind.
120642 ^ not for let suppose the man that,
120648 ^ that he will receive anything from the lord.
120654 ^ [he is] a man double-minded, unstable in all the ways of him.
120662 ^ let boast however the brother - of low degree in the exaltation of him;
120672 ^ he who [is] then
120674 ^ rich, in the humiliation of him,
120679 ^ because like a flower of grass he will pass away.
120684 ^ has risen for the sun with [its] burning heat
120691 ^ and withered the grass,
120695 ^ and the flower of it has fallen,
120700 ^ and the beauty of the appearance of it has perished.
120707 ^ thus also the rich [man] in the midst of the pursuits of him will fade away.
120716 ^ blessed [is the] man
120718 ^ who endures trial,
120721 ^ because
120722 ^ approved having been, he will receive the crown - of life
120729 ^ that he has promised
120731 ^ to those loving him.
120734 ^ no one
120735 ^ being tempted let say
120737 ^ -, by god i am being tempted.
120741 ^ - for
120743 ^ god unable to be tempted is
120746 ^ by evils;
120747 ^ tempts now he himself no one.
120751 ^ a man however is tempted,
120754 ^ by the own desire being drawn away
120759 ^ and being enticed.
120761 ^ then - desire,
120764 ^ having conceived, gives birth to sin;
120767 ^ - and
120769 ^ sin
120770 ^ having become fully grown, brings forth death.
120773 ^ not be misled, brothers my beloved.
120778 ^ every act of giving good, and every gift perfect,
120785 ^ from above is, coming down from the father - of lights,
120793 ^ with whom not there is variation or of shifting shadow.
120801 ^ having willed [it], he brought forth us by [the] word of truth,
120806 ^ for - to be us firstfruits a certain - of his creatures.
120815 ^ know [this], brothers my beloved.
120819 ^ let be however every man swift
120824 ^ unto - to hear, slow
120828 ^ unto - to speak, slow unto anger;
120834 ^ [the] anger for
120836 ^ of man, [the] righteousness of god not produces.
120841 ^ therefore,
120842 ^ having put aside all filthiness and abounding of wickedness, in humility receive the implanted word,
120854 ^ - being able
120856 ^ to save the souls of you.
120860 ^ be however doers of [the] word,
120864 ^ and not only, hearers
120868 ^ deceiving yourselves,
120870 ^ because if anyone a hearer of [the] word is
120876 ^ and not a doer,
120879 ^ this one is like a man
120882 ^ looking at [the] face - natural of him in a mirror;
120890 ^ he has viewed for himself
120893 ^ and has gone away
120895 ^ and immediately he has forgotten
120898 ^ what like he was.
120900 ^ the [one] however
120902 ^ having looked intently into [the] law perfect, that - of freedom,
120909 ^ and having continued in [it],
120911 ^ not a hearer forgetful having been,
120915 ^ but a doer of [the] work —
120918 ^ this one blessed in the work of him will be.
120925 ^ if anyone seems
120928 ^ religious to be,
120930 ^ not bridling [the] tongue of himself,
120934 ^ but deceiving [the] heart of himself,
120938 ^ of this one worthless [is]
120940 ^ the religion.
120942 ^ religion pure and undefiled before the god and father this is,
120953 ^ to visit orphans and widows in the tribulation of them;
120961 ^ unstained oneself to keep from the world.
120967 ^ brothers of me, not with partiality hold the faith of the lord of us jesus christ
120980 ^ - of glory.
120982 ^ if for might come into assembly of you a man with a gold ring in apparel splendid,
120993 ^ might come in then also a poor [man] in shabby apparel,
121000 ^ you should look also
121002 ^ upon the [one] wearing the apparel - splendid
121009 ^ and should say,
121011 ^ you sit you here honorably,
121015 ^ and to the poor should say,
121019 ^ you stand
121021 ^ or, sit there, under the footstool of me,
121028 ^ then not have you made a distinction among yourselves
121033 ^ and have become judges [with] thoughts evil?
121038 ^ listen, brothers my beloved.
121042 ^ not - god has chosen the poor - in this world [to be] rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom
121057 ^ that he promised
121059 ^ to those loving him?
121062 ^ you however have dishonored the poor.
121067 ^ not the rich are oppressing you
121072 ^ and they dragging you into court?
121078 ^ not they are blaspheming the good name
121084 ^ - having been called upon you?
121088 ^ if indeed [the] law you keep
121092 ^ royal, according to the scripture,
121096 ^ you shall love the neighbor of you
121100 ^ as yourself,”
121102 ^ well you are doing.
121104 ^ if however you show partiality,
121107 ^ sin you are committing,
121109 ^ being convicted by the law as transgressors.
121115 ^ whoever for
121117 ^ all the law shall keep,
121121 ^ shall stumble but in one [point], he has become of all guilty.
121128 ^ the [one] for having said,
121131 ^ not you shall commit adultery,” said also,
121135 ^ not you shall murder.”
121137 ^ if however not you do commit adultery,
121141 ^ do commit murder however,
121143 ^ you have become a transgressor of [the] law.
121146 ^ so speak
121148 ^ and so act
121151 ^ as
121152 ^ by [the] law of freedom
121155 ^ being about
121156 ^ to be judged.
121157 ^ - for
121159 ^ judgment without mercy [will be]
121161 ^ to the [one] not
121163 ^ having shown mercy.
121165 ^ triumphs over mercy judgment.
121168 ^ what [is] the profit, brothers of me,
121173 ^ if
121174 ^ faith says anyone
121177 ^ to have,
121178 ^ works however not he has?
121182 ^ not is able the faith
121186 ^ to save him?
121188 ^ now if a brother or a sister without clothes is,
121194 ^ and
121195 ^ lacking is - of daily food,
121200 ^ says then anyone to them
121204 ^ out from you,
121206 ^ go in peace;
121209 ^ be warmed
121210 ^ and be filled,
121212 ^ not gives however to them the needful things for the body,
121220 ^ what [is] the profit?
121223 ^ so also - faith,
121227 ^ if not it has works, dead is, by itself.
121235 ^ but will say someone,
121238 ^ you faith have,
121241 ^ and i works have.
121244 ^ show me the faith of you without - works,
121252 ^ and i you will show by the works of me, - faith.
121261 ^ you believe
121263 ^ that one is - god.
121268 ^ well you are doing!
121270 ^ even the demons believe [that],
121274 ^ and shudder!
121276 ^ do you want however
121278 ^ to come to know, o man foolish,
121282 ^ that - faith apart from - works worthless is?
121290 ^ abraham the father of us, not by works was justified,
121298 ^ having offered isaac the son of him upon the altar?
121306 ^ you see
121307 ^ that [his] faith was working with the works of him,
121314 ^ and by [his] works, [his] faith was perfected.
121321 ^ and was fulfilled the scripture
121325 ^ - saying,
121327 ^ believed then abraham - god,
121332 ^ and it was counted to him for righteousness,”
121337 ^ and a friend of god he was called.
121341 ^ you see
121342 ^ that by works is justified a man,
121347 ^ and not by faith alone.
121352 ^ likewise then also rahab the prostitute not by works was justified,
121362 ^ having received the messengers
121365 ^ and by another way having sent [them] forth?
121369 ^ just as for the body apart from spirit dead is,
121377 ^ so also - faith apart from works dead is.
121385 ^ not many [of you] teachers let be, brothers of mine,
121391 ^ knowing
121392 ^ that greater judgment we will receive.
121396 ^ in many ways for we stumble all.
121400 ^ if anyone in what he says not does stumble,
121406 ^ this one [is] a perfect man, able
121410 ^ to bridle indeed all the body.
121415 ^ if now, of the horses - bits
121421 ^ into the mouths we put
121425 ^ for - to obey them us,
121430 ^ even all the body of them we turn about.
121436 ^ behold,
121437 ^ also the ships,
121440 ^ so great being
121442 ^ and by winds strong being driven, are turned about by a very small rudder
121451 ^ wherever the impulse
121454 ^ of the [one] steering resolves.
121457 ^ thus also the tongue a small member is,
121464 ^ and exceeding things it boasts.
121467 ^ behold
121468 ^ a small fire, how great a forest it kindles.
121473 ^ also the tongue [is] a fire,
121477 ^ the world - of iniquity. the tongue is set among the members of us,
121488 ^ - defiling all the body,
121493 ^ and setting on fire the course - of nature,
121499 ^ and [itself] being set on fire by - hell.
121504 ^ all for
121506 ^ kinds of beasts both and of birds, of creeping things both and things of the sea, is subdued
121516 ^ and has been subdued by the race of the human,
121522 ^ - but
121524 ^ the tongue no one
121526 ^ to subdue is able
121528 ^ of men;
121529 ^ [it is] an unruly evil, full of poison deadly.
121534 ^ with it we bless our lord and father,
121541 ^ and with it we curse - men,
121547 ^ those according to [the] likeness of god
121551 ^ being made.
121552 ^ out of the same mouth proceed forth blessing and cursing.
121560 ^ not ought, brothers of me,
121564 ^ these things so to be.
121567 ^ not the spring out of the same opening pours forth - [both] fresh and - bitter?
121580 ^ not is able, brothers of me, a fig tree
121585 ^ olives to produce?
121587 ^ or a vine,
121589 ^ figs?
121590 ^ nor a salt [spring],
121592 ^ fresh to produce
121594 ^ water.
121595 ^ who [is] wise and understanding among you;
121601 ^ let him show out of the good conduct the works of him, in [the] humility of wisdom.
121612 ^ if however jealousy bitter you have,
121617 ^ and self-interest in the heart of you,
121623 ^ not boast [of it]
121625 ^ and lie against the truth.
121630 ^ not is this the wisdom
121635 ^ from above coming down,

121641 ^ where for jealousy and self-interest [exist],
121646 ^ there [will be] disorder and every evil thing.
121652 ^ - but

121671 ^ [the] fruit now
121673 ^ of righteousness in peace is sown

121733 ^ adulteresses! not know you
121736 ^ that the friendship with the world, hostility [with] god is?

121773 ^ greater however he gives
121776 ^ grace.

122459 ^ - of the toward you grace
122465 ^ having prophesied,
122466 ^ inquiring
122467 ^ into what or what manner of time was signifying the in them spirit of christ,
122478 ^ testifying beforehand - unto christ's sufferings and the after these glories,
122488 ^ to whom it was revealed
122490 ^ that not themselves,
122493 ^ you however, they were serving in those things
122497 ^ which now have been proclaimed to you
122501 ^ by those having proclaimed the gospel to you by [the] spirit holy
122508 ^ having been sent from heaven,
122511 ^ into which desire angels to look.
122516 ^ therefore
122517 ^ having girded up the loins of the mind of you,
122523 ^ being sober-minded, fully set [your] hope upon the being brought to you grace in [the] revelation of jesus christ,
122535 ^ as children of obedience, not
122539 ^ fashioning yourselves to the former in the ignorance of you desires.
122547 ^ but
122548 ^ as the [one] having called you [is] holy, also yourselves holy in all [your] conduct be,
122560 ^ because it has been written
122562 ^ holy you shall be,
122564 ^ because i [am] holy
122567 ^ and if [as] father you call on
122571 ^ the [one] impartially
122573 ^ judging according to the of each work,
122578 ^ in fear during the of the sojourn of you time conduct yourselves,
122586 ^ knowing
122587 ^ that not by perishable things — by silver or by gold — you were redeemed from the futile of you manner of life handed down from [your] fathers,
122600 ^ but by [the] precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot,
122608 ^ of christ,
122609 ^ having been foreknown indeed before [the] foundation of [the] world,
122614 ^ having been revealed however in [the] last - times for the sake of you, who by him believe
122626 ^ in god,
122628 ^ the [one] having raised up him out from [the] dead
122633 ^ and glory him having given,
122637 ^ so as for the faith of you, and hope, to be in god.
122646 ^ the souls of you having purified by - obedience to the truth unto brotherly love sincere, out of purity of heart, one another love fervently.
122664 ^ having been born again, not of seed perishable,
122669 ^ but of imperishable, by [the] word
122673 ^ living of god,
122675 ^ and abiding,
122677 ^ because, all flesh [is] like grass,
122682 ^ and all [the] glory of it like [the] flower of grass.
122689 ^ withers the grass,
122692 ^ and the flower falls away,
122696 ^ - but
122698 ^ the word of [the] lord abides to the age.”
122704 ^ this now is the word
122709 ^ - having been proclaimed to you.
122713 ^ having put aside therefore all malice, and all deceit, and hypocrisy, and envies, and all evil speakings, like newborn babies, - reasonable pure milk crave,
122735 ^ so that by it you may grow up in respect to salvation,
122741 ^ if indeed you have tasted
122743 ^ that [is] good the lord.
122747 ^ to whom coming, a stone
122751 ^ living,
122752 ^ by men indeed rejected,
122756 ^ in the sight of however
122758 ^ god chosen [and] precious, also you yourselves as stones
122765 ^ living, are being built up as a house spiritual into a priesthood holy,
122772 ^ to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god through jesus christ.
122780 ^ therefore it is contained in scripture:
122784 ^ behold,
122785 ^ i lay in zion a stone, cornerstone, a chosen precious;
122792 ^ and
122793 ^ the [one] believing on him, no not shall be put to shame.”
122800 ^ to you therefore [is] the preciousness,
122804 ^ - believing;
122806 ^ [to those] disobeying, however,
122808 ^ [the] stone
122809 ^ which have rejected
122811 ^ those building,
122813 ^ this has become into [the] head of [the] corner,”
122818 ^ and, a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense.”
122824 ^ [they] stumble at,
122826 ^ to the word being disobedient,
122829 ^ to which also they were appointed.
122833 ^ you however [are] a race chosen, a royal priesthood, a nation holy, a people for [his] possession,
122844 ^ so that the excellencies you may proclaim
122848 ^ of the [one] out of darkness you
122852 ^ having called, to the marvelous of him light,
122858 ^ who once [were] not a people,
122862 ^ now however [the] people of god;
122866 ^ those not
122868 ^ having received mercy,
122869 ^ now however
122871 ^ having received mercy.
122872 ^ beloved, i exhort [you] as aliens and sojourners,
122878 ^ to abstain from fleshly desires,
122882 ^ which war against the soul,
122887 ^ the conduct of you among the gentiles keeping
122894 ^ honorable,
122895 ^ so that
122896 ^ wherein which they speak against you as evildoers,
122902 ^ through the good deeds having witnessed, they may glorify - god in [the] day of visitation.
122913 ^ be in subjection to every human institution for the sake of the lord,
122920 ^ whether to [the] king
122922 ^ as being supreme,
122924 ^ or to governors,
122926 ^ as by him
122929 ^ being sent for vengeance to evildoers, praise then to well-doers,
122936 ^ because this is the will - of god,
122943 ^ doing good, to put to silence the - of foolish men ignorance,
122950 ^ as free,
122952 ^ and
122953 ^ not as a cover-up having
122957 ^ for evil the freedom,
122961 ^ but as of god servants.
122965 ^ everyone honor:
122967 ^ the brotherhood love,
122970 ^ - god fear,
122973 ^ the king honor.
122976 ^ - servants,
122978 ^ be subject with all fear to masters,
122984 ^ not only to the good and gentle,
122990 ^ but also to the unreasonable.
122994 ^ this for [is] acceptable,
122997 ^ if for sake of conscience toward god, endures anyone griefs,
123004 ^ suffering unjustly.
123006 ^ what kind of for credit [is it],
123009 ^ if
123010 ^ sinning
123011 ^ and being struck you shall endure?
123014 ^ but if
123016 ^ doing good
123017 ^ and suffering you shall endure,
123020 ^ this [is] commendable before god.
123024 ^ to this hereunto for you have been called,
123028 ^ because also christ suffered for you,
123034 ^ you leaving an example
123037 ^ that you should follow after the steps of him:
123042 ^ who sin not committed,
123046 ^ neither was found trickery in the mouth of him.”
123053 ^ who
123054 ^ being reviled, not reviled in return;
123057 ^ suffering not threatened;
123060 ^ he gave [himself] over however
123062 ^ to him judging justly.
123065 ^ who the sins of us
123069 ^ himself bore in the body of him on the tree,
123078 ^ so that,
123079 ^ - to sins having been dead, - to righteousness we might live.
123085 ^ by whose - wounds you have been healed.”
123089 ^ you were for
123091 ^ like sheep going astray,
123094 ^ but you have returned now to the shepherd and overseer of the souls of you.
123105 ^ likewise - wives,
123108 ^ be subject to the own husbands,
123112 ^ so that, even if any are disobedient to the word,
123119 ^ by the of the wives conduct, without word, they will be won over,
123127 ^ having witnessed the in respect pure conduct of you,
123134 ^ whose let it be not the external of braiding of hair and putting around of gold, or putting on of garments
123147 ^ adorning,
123148 ^ but the hidden of the heart man, in the imperishable of the gentle and quiet spirit,
123162 ^ which is before - god of great worth.
123168 ^ in this way for formerly also the holy women
123175 ^ - hoping in god used to adorn themselves,
123181 ^ being subject to the own husbands,
123185 ^ as sarah obeyed - abraham,
123190 ^ lord him calling,
123193 ^ of whom you have become
123195 ^ children,
123196 ^ doing good
123197 ^ and not fearing not one consternation.
123202 ^ - husbands likewise,
123205 ^ dwelling with [them] according to knowledge, as with a weaker vessel with the female,
123213 ^ rendering honor, as also
123217 ^ joint-heirs of [the] grace of life,
123220 ^ so as for - not
123223 ^ to be hindered the prayers of you.
123227 ^ - now
123229 ^ the end: all [be] single-minded, sympathetic, loving as brothers, tender-hearted, humble,
123236 ^ not repaying evil for evil
123241 ^ or insult for insult;
123245 ^ on the contrary however, blessing,
123248 ^ because to this you were called,
123252 ^ so that blessing you should inherit.
123255 ^ the [one] for
123257 ^ desiring
123258 ^ life to love,
123260 ^ and to see days good, let him keep the tongue from evil,
123269 ^ and lips
123271 ^ - not
123273 ^ to speak deceit.
123275 ^ let him turn away also from evil,
123279 ^ and let him do good.
123282 ^ let him seek peace
123284 ^ and let him pursue it.
123287 ^ because [the] eyes of [the] lord [are] on [the] righteous,
123292 ^ and [the] ears of him toward prayer of them.
123298 ^ [the] face however
123300 ^ of [the] lord
123301 ^ [is] against those doing evil.”
123304 ^ and who [is]
123306 ^ he who will harm you,
123309 ^ if for that which [is] good, zealous you should be?
123314 ^ but if even you should suffer because of righteousness,
123320 ^ [you are] blessed.
123321 ^ - and
123323 ^ the threats of them not you should be afraid of,
123327 ^ neither should you be troubled.”
123329 ^ [as] lord however,
123331 ^ - christ sanctify in the hearts of you,
123338 ^ ready always
123340 ^ for a defense
123342 ^ to everyone - asking you an account concerning the in you hope;
123352 ^ yet with gentleness and fear,
123357 ^ a conscience having
123359 ^ good,
123360 ^ so that
123361 ^ in this they might speak against you, they shall be ashamed
123365 ^ those reviling your - good in christ manner of life.
123373 ^ [it is] better for
123375 ^ doing good
123376 ^ if wills [it] the will - of god, to suffer,
123383 ^ than
123384 ^ doing evil,
123385 ^ because also christ once for sins suffered,
123392 ^ [the] righteous for [the] unrighteous,
123395 ^ so that you he might bring - to god,
123400 ^ having been put to death indeed in [the] flesh,
123403 ^ having been made alive however in [the] spirit,
123406 ^ in which also to the in prison spirits,
123413 ^ having gone he preached,
123415 ^ having disobeyed at one time,
123417 ^ when was waiting the - of god longsuffering in [the] days of noah,
123426 ^ being prepared of [the] ark,
123428 ^ in which a few —
123431 ^ that is, eight souls — were saved through water,
123438 ^ which also you
123441 ^ prefigures now saving baptism,
123445 ^ not of flesh a putting away
123448 ^ of [the] filth,
123449 ^ but of a conscience good, [the] demand toward god, through [the] resurrection of jesus christ,
123459 ^ who is at [the] right hand - of god,
123465 ^ having gone into heaven,
123468 ^ having been subjected to him angels and authorities and powers.
123475 ^ christ therefore having suffered in [the] flesh,
123479 ^ also you the same mind arm yourselves with,
123485 ^ because
123486 ^ the [one] having suffered [in the] flesh is done with sin,
123491 ^ so as - no longer to men’s desires but to [the] will of god, the remaining in [the] flesh
123503 ^ to live
123504 ^ time.
123505 ^ [is] sufficient for the
123508 ^ past time
123510 ^ the desire of the gentiles to have carried out,
123515 ^ having walked in sensuality, lusts, drunkenness, orgies, carousing, and abominable idolatries.
123525 ^ with respect to this they think it strange,
123528 ^ not running with [them] of you into the same - of debauchery overflow,
123537 ^ speaking evil [of you],
123538 ^ who will give account
123541 ^ to him who ready
123543 ^ is
123544 ^ to judge
123545 ^ [the] living and [the] dead.
123548 ^ to this [end] indeed, even to [the] dead the gospel was proclaimed,
123554 ^ so that they might be judged indeed according to men in [the] flesh;
123560 ^ they might live however according to god in [the] spirit.
123565 ^ of all now
123567 ^ the end has drawn near.
123570 ^ be clear-minded therefore,
123572 ^ and sober for the purpose of prayers,
123576 ^ above all things,
123578 ^ - among yourselves love fervent having,
123584 ^ because love covers over a multitude of sins,
123589 ^ hospitable to one another, without complaint,
123594 ^ each
123595 ^ as has received a gift, to each other
123600 ^ them serving, as good stewards of [the] manifold grace of god:
123608 ^ if anyone speaks,
123611 ^ as oracles of god;
123614 ^ if anyone serves,
123617 ^ as of strength
123620 ^ which supplies - god,
123624 ^ so that in all things may be glorified - god through jesus christ,
123633 ^ to whom be the glory and the power to the ages of the ages. amen.
123646 ^ beloved, not be surprised at the among you fire
123653 ^ for a trial to you taking place,
123657 ^ as if a strange thing to you were happening.
123661 ^ but as you have shared in the - of christ sufferings,
123668 ^ rejoice,
123669 ^ so that also in the revelation of the glory of him, you may rejoice
123678 ^ exulting.
123679 ^ if you are insulted in [the] name of christ,
123684 ^ [you are] blessed,
123685 ^ because the - of glory and - - of god spirit upon you rests.
123697 ^ not for any of you let suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evildoer, or as a troublesome meddler;
123711 ^ if however as a christian,
123715 ^ not let him be ashamed;
123717 ^ let him glorify however - god in the name this.
123725 ^ for [it is] the time [for]
123728 ^ - to have begun the judgment from the house - of god;
123737 ^ if now first from us,
123742 ^ what [will be] the outcome
123745 ^ of those disobeying the - of god gospel?
123751 ^ and, if the righteous [one] with difficulty is saved,
123757 ^ the ungodly and sinner where will appear?”
123763 ^ therefore also,
123765 ^ those suffering according to the will - of god, to [the] faithful creator let them commit the souls of them in well doing.
123780 ^ elders - among you, i exhort,
123785 ^ - a fellow elder and witness of the - of christ sufferings, who [am] also
123795 ^ of the being about
123797 ^ to be revealed glory partaker:
123800 ^ shepherd the among you flock - of god,
123807 ^ exercising oversight
123808 ^ not under compulsion,
123810 ^ but willingly, according to god;
123814 ^ and not for base gain,
123816 ^ but eagerly;
123818 ^ not
123819 ^ as exercising lordship over - those in your charge,
123823 ^ but
123824 ^ examples being
123826 ^ to the flock.
123828 ^ and having been revealed the chief shepherd,
123832 ^ you will receive the unfading - of glory crown.
123838 ^ likewise, younger [ones], be subject to [your] elders.
123842 ^ all now one to another - humility gird on,
123848 ^ because, - god [the] proud opposes,
123853 ^ to [the] humble however he gives grace.”
123857 ^ be humbled therefore under the mighty hand - of god,
123865 ^ so that you he may exalt in [due] time,
123870 ^ all the anxiety of you having cast upon him,
123877 ^ because with him there is care about you.
123882 ^ be sober-minded;
123883 ^ watch.
123884 ^ the adversary of you, [the] devil,
123888 ^ as a lion roaring prowls about,
123892 ^ seeking
123893 ^ whom to devour,
123895 ^ whom you should resist,
123897 ^ firm in the faith,
123900 ^ knowing
123901 ^ the same - sufferings - throughout [the] world in your brotherhood to be accomplished.
123911 ^ the now
123913 ^ god of all grace,
123916 ^ the [one] having called you to the eternal of him glory in christ,
123926 ^ a little while [of you] having suffered,
123928 ^ he himself will perfect,
123930 ^ will confirm,
123931 ^ will strengthen,
123932 ^ [and] will establish [you].
123933 ^ to him [be] the power to the ages. amen.
123940 ^ through silvanus, to you
123943 ^ the faithful brother
123946 ^ as i regard [him], through few [words] i have written,
123951 ^ exhorting
123952 ^ and testifying
123954 ^ this to be [the] true grace - of god,
123960 ^ in which you stand.
123963 ^ greets you she in babylon, elected with [you],
123969 ^ and mark, the son of me.
123974 ^ greet one another with a kiss of love.
123979 ^ peace [be] to you all who [are] in christ.
123985 ^ simon peter, a servant and apostle of jesus christ,
123992 ^ to those equally precious with ours
123995 ^ having obtained
123996 ^ a faith, through [the] righteousness of the god of us and savior, jesus christ:
124006 ^ grace to you
124008 ^ and peace be multiplied in [the] knowledge - of god and of jesus the lord of us.
124020 ^ accordingly, all things to us the divine power of him
124027 ^ - toward life and godliness has given, through the knowledge
124036 ^ of the [one] having called us [by his] own glory and excellence,
124043 ^ through which the precious and magnificent to us
124050 ^ promises he has given,
124052 ^ so that through these you might become of [the] divine partakers
124058 ^ nature,
124059 ^ having escaped the in the world in desire, decay.
124067 ^ and very [reason] for this now,
124071 ^ earnestness all having brought in, supplement into the faith of you - virtue,
124081 ^ into and
124083 ^ - virtue - knowledge,
124087 ^ into then
124089 ^ - knowledge - self-control,
124093 ^ into then
124095 ^ - self-control - endurance,
124099 ^ into then
124101 ^ - endurance - godliness,
124105 ^ in then
124107 ^ - godliness - brotherly affection,
124111 ^ in then
124113 ^ - brotherly affection - love.
124117 ^ these things for
124119 ^ in you being
124121 ^ and abounding, neither idle nor unfruitful make [you], as to the of the lord of us jesus christ, knowledge.
124136 ^ in whomever for not are present these things, blind he is,
124143 ^ being short sighted,
124144 ^ forgetfulness having received
124146 ^ of the purification the former of him sins.
124152 ^ therefore rather, brothers, be diligent,
124156 ^ sure your - calling and election to make,
124163 ^ these things for practicing never not shall you stumble at any time.
124170 ^ in this way for richly will be supplied to you the entrance into the eternal kingdom of the lord of us and savior, jesus christ.
124188 ^ therefore i will be ready
124190 ^ always you to remind concerning these things,
124195 ^ though knowing [them]
124197 ^ and having been strengthened in the
124201 ^ being present [in you] truth.
124203 ^ right now i esteem it,
124206 ^ as long as i am in this - tabernacle, to stir up you by putting [you] in remembrance,
124217 ^ knowing
124218 ^ that impending is the putting off of the tabernacle of me,
124226 ^ as also the lord of us jesus christ has made clear to me.
124235 ^ i will be diligent now also
124238 ^ at every time, to have for you after - my departure, - these things a lasting remembrance to make.
124249 ^ not for
124251 ^ cleverly devised fables having followed out, we have made known to you the of the lord of us jesus christ power and coming,
124265 ^ but
124266 ^ eyewitnesses having been
124268 ^ - of his majesty.
124271 ^ having received for from god [the] father honor and glory,
124279 ^ a voice was brought to him,
124282 ^ such as follows by the majestic glory:
124287 ^ the son of me, - beloved of me, this is,
124295 ^ in whom i have found delight.”
124299 ^ and this - voice we heard
124305 ^ from heaven, having been brought
124308 ^ with him, being in the holy mountain.
124315 ^ and we have more certain the prophetic word,
124321 ^ to which well you do
124324 ^ taking heed, as to a lamp
124327 ^ shining in [a] dark place,
124331 ^ until this day shall have dawned
124335 ^ and [the] morning star shall have arisen in the hearts of you,
124342 ^ this first knowing,
124345 ^ that any prophecy of scripture of its own interpretation not is.
124353 ^ not for by [the] will of man was brought prophecy at any time,
124360 ^ but
124361 ^ by [the] spirit holy being carried, spoke from god men.
124369 ^ there were however also false prophets among the people,
124376 ^ as also among you there will be false teachers,
124382 ^ who will stealthily introduce heresies destructive,
124386 ^ even
124387 ^ the
124388 ^ having bought them master denying,
124392 ^ bringing upon themselves swift destruction.

124416 ^ for whom the judgment of long ago not is idle,
124422 ^ and the destruction of them not slumbers.

124749 ^ in which i am stirring up of you in putting [you] in remembrance
124755 ^ - pure mind,
124758 ^ to remember the having been spoken beforehand words — by the holy prophets and of the - apostles through your — commandment
124772 ^ of the lord and savior,
124776 ^ this first knowing,
124779 ^ that will come in [the] last of the days with scoffing scoffers,
124788 ^ according to - own evil desires of them following
124794 ^ and saying,
124796 ^ where is the promise of the coming of him?
124803 ^ from [the time] that for the fathers fell asleep,
124809 ^ all things as they were continue from [the] beginning of creation.
124815 ^ it is concealed from indeed them
124818 ^ this willingly,
124820 ^ that heavens existed long ago,
124824 ^ and [the] earth
124826 ^ out of water and through water having been composed by the - of god word,
124836 ^ through which the at that time world,
124841 ^ with water having been deluged, perished.
124844 ^ - but
124846 ^ now the heavens and the earth,
124851 ^ by the same word having been stored up exist, for fire
124857 ^ being kept unto [the] day of judgment and destruction - of ungodly men.
124866 ^ [this] one however
124868 ^ thing not let be hidden from you, beloved,
124873 ^ that one day with [the] lord [is] like a thousand years,
124881 ^ and a thousand years like day one.
124887 ^ not does delay the lord the promise,
124892 ^ as some slowness esteem,
124896 ^ but is patient toward you,
124900 ^ not willing
124902 ^ [for] any to perish,
124904 ^ but all to repentance to come.
124909 ^ will come however [the] day of [the] lord like a thief,
124915 ^ in which the heavens with a roar will pass away,
124921 ^ elements then
124923 ^ burning with heat will be dissolved,
124925 ^ and [the] earth and the in it works not will be found.
124934 ^ these things in this way
124936 ^ all being dissolved,
124938 ^ what kind ought to be you? in holy conduct and godliness,
124947 ^ expecting
124948 ^ and hastening the coming of the - of god day,
124956 ^ by reason of which [the] heavens
124959 ^ being set on fire will be dissolved,
124961 ^ and [the] elements
124963 ^ burning with heat are melting.
124965 ^ new however
124967 ^ heavens, and earth a new, according to the promise of him, we are awaiting,

125020 ^ speaking in them concerning these things,
125025 ^ among which are difficult to be understood some things,
125030 ^ which the ignorant and unestablished distort,
125036 ^ as also the other scriptures, to the own of them destruction.
125046 ^ you therefore, beloved,
125049 ^ knowing [this] beforehand, beware,
125051 ^ that not
125053 ^ by the of the lawless error having been led away, you should fall from the own steadfastness.
125062 ^ grow however in grace, and in knowledge of the lord of us and savior jesus christ.
125075 ^ to him [be] the glory both now and to [the] day of eternity.
125084 ^ that which was from [the] beginning,
125088 ^ that which we have heard,
125090 ^ that which we have seen with the eyes of us,
125095 ^ that which we have gazed upon
125097 ^ and the hands of us have handled,
125102 ^ concerning the word - of life —
125107 ^ and the life was made manifest,
125111 ^ and we have seen
125113 ^ and bear witness,
125115 ^ and we proclaim to you the life - eternal
125122 ^ which was with the father
125127 ^ and was revealed to us —
125130 ^ that which we have seen
125132 ^ and have heard, we proclaim also to you,
125137 ^ so that also you fellowship may have with us.
125144 ^ indeed the fellowship now
125148 ^ - of us [is] with the father, and with the son of him, jesus christ.
125160 ^ and these things write we
125164 ^ so that the joy of us might be
125169 ^ complete.
125170 ^ and is this the message
125175 ^ that we have heard from him,
125179 ^ and we preach to you,
125182 ^ that - god light is,
125187 ^ and darkness in him, not is none.
125194 ^ if we should say
125196 ^ that fellowship we have with him,
125201 ^ and yet in the darkness should walk,
125206 ^ we lie
125207 ^ and not do practice the truth.
125212 ^ if in the light we should walk
125217 ^ as he is in the light,
125223 ^ fellowship we have with one another,
125227 ^ and the blood of jesus, the son of him, cleanses us from all sin.
125239 ^ if we should say
125241 ^ that sin not we have,
125245 ^ ourselves we deceive,
125247 ^ and the truth not is in us.
125254 ^ if we should confess the sins of us,
125259 ^ faithful he is
125261 ^ and just,
125263 ^ that he may forgive us [our] sins,
125268 ^ and might cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
125274 ^ if we should say
125276 ^ that not we have sinned,
125279 ^ a liar we make him,
125282 ^ and the word of him not is in us.
125290 ^ little children of me, these things i am writing to you
125295 ^ so that not you might sin.
125298 ^ and if anyone should sin,
125302 ^ an advocate we have with the father,
125307 ^ jesus christ [the] righteous [one].
125310 ^ and he [the] propitiation is for the sins of us;
125318 ^ not for the of ours and only,
125324 ^ but also for all the world.
125330 ^ and by this we know
125334 ^ that we have come to know him,
125337 ^ if the commandments of him we should keep.
125342 ^ the [one] saying
125344 ^ -, i have known him,
125347 ^ and the commandments of him not keeping, a liar he is,
125355 ^ and in him the truth not is.
125362 ^ whoever however - may keep his - word,
125369 ^ truly in him the love - of god has been perfected.
125377 ^ by this we know
125380 ^ that in him we are:
125384 ^ the [one] claiming in him
125388 ^ to abide, ought
125390 ^ just as that walk also he
125395 ^ in the same way walked.
125397 ^ beloved, not a commandment new i am writing to you,
125403 ^ but a commandment old,
125406 ^ which you have had from [the] beginning.
125410 ^ the commandment - old is the word
125417 ^ that you have heard.
125419 ^ again, a commandment new i am writing to you,
125424 ^ which is true in him and in you,
125432 ^ because the darkness is passing away,
125436 ^ and the light - true already shines.
125443 ^ the [one] claiming
125445 ^ in the light to be
125449 ^ and the brother of him hating, in the darkness is even until now.
125460 ^ the [one] loving the brother of him, in the light abides,
125469 ^ and cause for stumbling in him not there is.
125475 ^ the [one] however
125477 ^ hating the brother of him, in the darkness is,
125485 ^ and in the darkness walks;
125490 ^ and not does he know
125493 ^ where he is going,
125495 ^ because the darkness has blinded the eyes of him.
125502 ^ i am writing to you, little children,
125505 ^ because have been forgiven your - sins for the sake of the name of him.
125514 ^ i am writing to you, fathers,
125517 ^ because you have known him who [is] from [the] beginning.
125522 ^ i am writing to you, young men,
125525 ^ because you have overcome the evil [one].
125529 ^ i have written to you, little children,
125532 ^ because you know the father.
125536 ^ i have written to you, fathers,
125539 ^ because you know him who [is] from [the] beginning.
125544 ^ i have written to you, young men,
125547 ^ because strong you are,
125550 ^ and the word - of god in you abides,
125558 ^ and you have overcome the evil [one].
125562 ^ not love the world
125566 ^ nor the things in the world.
125571 ^ if anyone should love the world,
125576 ^ not is the love of the father in him,
125584 ^ because all that [is] in the world, the desire of the flesh, and the desire of the eyes, and the vaunting of life, not is from the father,
125609 ^ but from the world is.
125614 ^ and the world is passing away,
125618 ^ and the desire of it;
125622 ^ the [one] however
125624 ^ doing the will - of god abides to the age.
125633 ^ little children, [the] last hour it is,
125637 ^ and as you have heard
125640 ^ that antichrist is coming,
125643 ^ even now antichrists many have arisen,
125648 ^ whereby we know
125650 ^ that [the] last hour it is.
125654 ^ from among us they went out,
125657 ^ but not they were of us;
125662 ^ if for of us they had been,
125667 ^ they would have remained - with us.
125671 ^ but [it is] so that it might be made manifest
125674 ^ that not they are all of us.
125680 ^ and you [the] anointing have from the holy [one],
125687 ^ and know you all.
125690 ^ not i have written to you
125693 ^ because not you know the truth,
125698 ^ but because you know it,
125702 ^ and because any lie, of the truth not is.
125711 ^ who is the liar,
125715 ^ if not
125717 ^ the [one] denying
125719 ^ that jesus not is the christ?
125725 ^ this is the antichrist,
125729 ^ the [one] denying the father and the son.
125736 ^ everyone
125737 ^ - denying the son, neither the father has he.
125745 ^ the [one] confessing the son, also the father has.
125753 ^ you,
125754 ^ what you have heard from [the] beginning, in you let it abide.
125761 ^ if in you should abide
125765 ^ what from [the] beginning you have heard,
125769 ^ also you in the son and in the father will abide.
125779 ^ and this is the promise
125784 ^ that he promised us:
125788 ^ - life - eternal.
125792 ^ these things i have written to you
125795 ^ concerning those leading astray you.
125799 ^ and you,
125801 ^ the anointing
125803 ^ that you received from him, abides in you,
125810 ^ and not need you have
125814 ^ that anyone should teach you.
125818 ^ but just as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things,
125827 ^ and true is,
125830 ^ and not is a lie;
125834 ^ and just as it has taught you,
125838 ^ you shall abide in him.
125841 ^ and now, little children, abide in him,
125847 ^ so that when he appears
125850 ^ we might have boldness
125852 ^ and not be ashamed before him at the coming of him.
125861 ^ if you know
125863 ^ that righteous he is,
125866 ^ you know
125867 ^ that also everyone
125870 ^ - practicing - righteousness, of him has been begotten.
125877 ^ behold
125878 ^ what love has given to us the father,
125884 ^ that children of god we should be called —
125888 ^ and we are!
125890 ^ because of this, the world not knows us,
125897 ^ because not it knew him.
125901 ^ beloved, now children of god are we,
125906 ^ and not yet has been revealed
125909 ^ what we will be.
125911 ^ we know
125912 ^ that when he appears,
125915 ^ like him we will be,
125918 ^ for we will see him
125921 ^ as he is.
125923 ^ and everyone
125925 ^ - having the hope this in him, purifies himself,
125934 ^ just as he pure is.
125938 ^ everyone - committing - sin, also - lawlessness commits;
125947 ^ and - sin is - lawlessness.
125953 ^ and you know
125955 ^ that he appeared
125958 ^ so that - sins he might take away;
125962 ^ and sin in him not there is.
125968 ^ anyone - in him
125972 ^ abiding, not sins;
125975 ^ anyone - sinning, not has seen him,
125981 ^ nor has he known him.
125984 ^ little children, no one let lead astray you;
125988 ^ the [one] practicing - righteousness, righteous is,
125994 ^ just as he righteous is.
125998 ^ the [one] practicing - sin, of the devil is,
126006 ^ because from [the] beginning the devil has been sinning.
126012 ^ for this [reason] was revealed the son - of god,
126019 ^ so that he might destroy the works of the devil.
126025 ^ anyone - having been born of - god, sin not practices,
126034 ^ because seed of him in him abides,
126040 ^ and not he is able
126043 ^ to continue sinning,
126044 ^ because of - god he has been born.
126049 ^ through this manifest are the children - of god and the children of the devil:
126062 ^ anyone - not
126065 ^ practicing righteousness not is of - god,
126072 ^ and also
126073 ^ the [one] not
126075 ^ loving the brother of him.
126079 ^ for this is the message
126084 ^ that you have heard from [the] beginning,
126088 ^ that we should love one another,
126091 ^ not as cain , [who] of the evil [one] was
126098 ^ and slew the brother of him.
126103 ^ and because of what he slayed him?
126108 ^ because the works of him evil were,
126114 ^ those however
126116 ^ of the brother of him, righteous.
126120 ^ and not be surprised, brothers,
126124 ^ if hates you the world.
126129 ^ we know
126131 ^ that we have passed from - death to - life,
126139 ^ because we love [our] brothers.
126143 ^ the [one] not
126145 ^ loving abides in - death.
126150 ^ everyone - hating the brother of him a murderer is;
126158 ^ and you know
126160 ^ that any murderer, not has life eternal
126167 ^ in him abiding.
126170 ^ by this we have known - love,
126175 ^ because he for us the life of him laid down;
126183 ^ and we ought for [our] brothers,
126189 ^ [our] lives to lay down.
126192 ^ whoever now - might have the goods of the world,
126200 ^ and might see the brother of him
126205 ^ need having,
126207 ^ and might close up the heart of him from him,
126214 ^ how the love - of god abides in him?
126222 ^ little children, not we should love in word, nor in tongue,
126229 ^ but in action and in truth.
126234 ^ and by this we will know
126238 ^ that of the truth we are,
126243 ^ and before him we will assure the heart of us,
126250 ^ that if should condemn [us] our - heart,
126256 ^ that greater than is - god
126261 ^ the heart of us,
126264 ^ and he knows all things.
126267 ^ beloved, if the heart of us not should condemn [us],
126274 ^ confidence we have toward - god,
126279 ^ and
126280 ^ whatever if we might ask, we receive from him,
126286 ^ because the commandments of him we keep,
126291 ^ and the things pleasing before him we do.
126297 ^ and this is the commandment of him,
126303 ^ that we should believe in the name the son of him, jesus christ,
126312 ^ and we should love one another,
126315 ^ just as he gave [the] commandment to us.
126319 ^ and
126320 ^ the [one] keeping the commandments of him, in him abides,
126328 ^ and he in him.
126332 ^ and by this we know
126336 ^ that he abides in us,
126340 ^ by the spirit
126343 ^ whom to us he has given.
126346 ^ beloved, not every spirit believe,
126351 ^ but test the spirits,
126355 ^ whether of - god they are,
126360 ^ because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
126367 ^ by this you know the spirit - of god:
126374 ^ every spirit
126376 ^ that confesses jesus christ
126380 ^ in [the] flesh having come, of - god is;
126387 ^ and any spirit
126390 ^ that not confesses - jesus, from - god not is.
126400 ^ and this is that of the antichrist,
126406 ^ which you heard
126408 ^ that is coming,
126410 ^ and now in the world is already.
126417 ^ you from - god are, little children,
126423 ^ and have overcome them,
126426 ^ because greater is the [one] in you
126432 ^ than the [one] in the world.
126437 ^ they of the world are;
126442 ^ because of this from out of the world they speak,
126448 ^ and the world them listens to.

126458 ^ the [one] knowing - god listens to us.
126464 ^ he who not is from - god, not listens to us.
126473 ^ by this we know the spirit - of truth and the spirit - of falsehood.
126485 ^ beloved, we should love one another,
126488 ^ because - love from - god is;
126495 ^ and
126496 ^ everyone - loving, from - god has been born,
126503 ^ and knows - god.
126507 ^ the [one] not
126509 ^ loving, not has known - god,
126514 ^ because - god love is.
126519 ^ in this has been revealed the love - of god among us,
126528 ^ that the son of him, the one and only, has sent - god into the world,
126540 ^ so that we might live through him.
126544 ^ in this is - love,
126549 ^ not that we loved - god,
126555 ^ but that he loved us
126560 ^ and sent the son of him [as] a propitiation for the sins of us.
126570 ^ beloved, if so - god loved us,
126577 ^ also we ought
126580 ^ one another to love.
126582 ^ god no one at any time has seen;
126586 ^ if we should love one another,
126589 ^ - god in us abides
126594 ^ and the love of him in us
126600 ^ having been perfected is.
126602 ^ by this we know
126605 ^ that in him we abide,
126609 ^ and he in us,
126613 ^ because from out the spirit of him he has given to us.
126620 ^ and we have seen
126623 ^ and testify
126625 ^ that the father has sent the son [as] savior of the world.
126634 ^ whoever if shall confess
126637 ^ that jesus is the son - of god,
126644 ^ - god in him abides,
126649 ^ and he in - god.

126657 ^ and have come to believe the love
126661 ^ that has - god as to us.
126667 ^ - god love is,
126671 ^ and
126672 ^ the [one] abiding in - love, in - god abides,
126681 ^ and - god in him abides.
126687 ^ in this has been perfected - love with us,
126694 ^ so that confidence we may have in the day - of judgment,
126702 ^ that just as he is,
126706 ^ also we are in the world this.
126713 ^ fear no there is in - love,
126719 ^ but - perfect love out casts - fear,
126727 ^ because the fear punishment has;
126732 ^ the [one] now fearing, not has been perfected in - love.
126740 ^ we love
126742 ^ because he first loved us.
126747 ^ if anyone should say
126750 ^ -, i love - god,
126754 ^ and the brother of him should hate,
126759 ^ a liar he is.
126761 ^ the [one] for not loving the brother of him,
126768 ^ whom he has seen,
126770 ^ - god,
126772 ^ whom not he has seen, not is he able
126777 ^ to love.
126778 ^ and this the commandment we have from him,
126785 ^ that
126786 ^ the [one] loving - god should love also the brother of him.
126795 ^ everyone - believing
126798 ^ that jesus is the christ, of - god has been born,
126807 ^ and
126808 ^ everyone - loving
126811 ^ the [one] having begotten [him], loves also
126815 ^ the [one] having been begotten from him.
126819 ^ by this we know
126822 ^ that we love the children - of god,
126828 ^ when - god we love
126832 ^ and the commandments of him keep.
126837 ^ this for is the love - of god,
126844 ^ that the commandments of him we should keep;
126849 ^ and the commandments of him burdensome not are.
126856 ^ for
126857 ^ everyone - having been born of - god overcomes the world;
126866 ^ and this is the victory
126871 ^ - having overcome the world:
126875 ^ the faith of us.
126878 ^ who now is
126881 ^ the [one] overcoming the world,
126885 ^ if not
126887 ^ the [one] believing
126889 ^ that jesus is the son - of god?
126896 ^ this is
126898 ^ the [one] having come by water and blood, jesus christ;
126906 ^ not by - water only,
126911 ^ but by - water and by - blood.
126919 ^ and the spirit is
126923 ^ the [one] testifying,
126925 ^ because the spirit is the truth.
126931 ^ for three there are
126934 ^ - bearing testimony:
126936 ^ the spirit and the water and the blood —
126944 ^ and these three in - one are.
126951 ^ if the testimony - of men we receive,
126957 ^ the testimony - of god greater is.
126963 ^ for this is the testimony - of god
126970 ^ that he has testified concerning the son of him.
126976 ^ the [one] believing in the son - of god has the testimony in himself.
126988 ^ the [one] not
126990 ^ believing - god, a liar has made him,
126996 ^ because not he has believed in the testimony
127002 ^ that has testified - god concerning the son him.
127010 ^ and this is the testimony,
127015 ^ that life eternal has given to us, - god
127022 ^ and this the life in the son his is.
127031 ^ the [one] having the son has - life;
127038 ^ the [one] not
127040 ^ having the son - of god, - life not has.
127049 ^ these things have i written to you
127052 ^ so that you may know
127054 ^ that life you have
127057 ^ eternal,
127058 ^ to those believing in the name of the son - of god.
127067 ^ and this is the confidence
127072 ^ that we have toward him,
127076 ^ that if anything we might ask according to the will of him,
127084 ^ he hears us.
127086 ^ and if we know
127089 ^ that he hears us,
127092 ^ whatever if we might ask,
127095 ^ we know
127096 ^ that we have the requests
127100 ^ that we have asked from him.
127104 ^ if anyone should see the brother of him
127110 ^ sinning a sin not unto death,
127115 ^ he shall ask,
127116 ^ and he will give him life,
127120 ^ to those sinning not unto death.
127125 ^ there is a sin unto death;
127129 ^ not concerning that do i say
127133 ^ that he should implore.
127135 ^ all unrighteousness sin is,
127139 ^ and there is sin not unto death.
127145 ^ we know
127146 ^ that
127147 ^ everyone - having been born of - god not continues to sin,
127155 ^ but
127156 ^ the [one] having been begotten of - god protects him,
127163 ^ and the evil [one] not does touch him.
127169 ^ we know
127170 ^ that of - god we are,
127175 ^ and the world whole, in the evil [one] lies.
127183 ^ we know now
127185 ^ that the son - of god is come,
127191 ^ and has given us understanding,
127195 ^ so that we may know him who [is] true;
127199 ^ and we are in him who [is] true, in the son of him, jesus christ.

130578 ^ to kill with sword, and with famine, and with plague, and by the beasts of the earth.
130593 ^ and when he opened the fifth seal,
130599 ^ i saw under the altar the souls
130605 ^ of those having been slain because of the word - of god, and because of the testimony
130616 ^ which they had upheld.
130618 ^ and they were crying in a voice loud,

130668 ^ those being about
130670 ^ to be killed
130671 ^ as also [had been] they.
130674 ^ and i saw
130676 ^ when he opened the seal - sixth,
130682 ^ and an earthquake great there was,
130686 ^ and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair,
130694 ^ and the moon whole became like blood,
130701 ^ and the stars of heaven fell to the earth,
130710 ^ as a fig tree casts the unripe figs of it,
130716 ^ by a wind great being shaken.
130720 ^ and - heaven departed like a scroll
130726 ^ being rolled up,
130727 ^ and every mountain and island out of the places of them were moved.
130737 ^ and the kings of the earth, and the great ones, and the commanders, and the rich, and the powerful, and every slave and free, hid themselves in the caves, and among the rocks of the mountains.
130770 ^ and they say to the mountains and to the rocks,
130777 ^ fall on us
130780 ^ and hide us from [the] face
130785 ^ of the [one] sitting on the throne, and from the wrath of the lamb,
130796 ^ because has come the day - great of the wrath of them,
130805 ^ and who is able
130808 ^ to stand?
130809 ^ after these things i saw four angels
130814 ^ standing upon the four corners of the earth,
130821 ^ holding the four winds of the earth,
130827 ^ so that no would blow wind on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.
130842 ^ and i saw another angel,
130846 ^ having ascended from [the] rising of [the] sun,
130850 ^ having [the] seal of god
130853 ^ [the] living.
130854 ^ and he cried in a voice loud to the four angels
130861 ^ to whom it had been given to them
130864 ^ to harm the earth and the sea,
130870 ^ saying,
130871 ^ not harm the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees,
130881 ^ until we shall have sealed the servants of the god of us, on the foreheads of them.
130892 ^ and i heard the number
130896 ^ of those having been sealed,
130898 ^ one hundred forty four thousand,
130902 ^ having been sealed out of every tribe of [the] sons of israel:
130908 ^ out of [the] tribe of judah twelve thousand having been sealed,
130914 ^ out of [the] tribe of reuben twelve thousand,
130919 ^ out of [the] tribe of gad twelve thousand,
130924 ^ out of [the] tribe of asher twelve thousand,
130929 ^ out of [the] tribe of naphtali twelve thousand,
130934 ^ out of [the] tribe of manasseh twelve thousand,
130939 ^ out of [the] tribe of simeon twelve thousand,
130944 ^ out of [the] tribe of levi twelve thousand,
130949 ^ out of [the] tribe of isaachar twelve thousand,
130954 ^ out of [the] tribe of zebulun twelve thousand,
130959 ^ out of [the] tribe of joseph twelve thousand,
130964 ^ out of [the] tribe of benjamin twelve thousand having been sealed.
130970 ^ after these things i looked,
130973 ^ and behold,
130975 ^ a multitude great,
130977 ^ which
130978 ^ to number it no one was able, out of every nation, and tribes, and peoples, and tongues,
130991 ^ standing before the throne and before the lamb,
130999 ^ having been clothed with robes white,
131002 ^ and palm branches in the hands of them.
131008 ^ and they were crying out in a voice loud,
131012 ^ saying:
131013 ^ - salvation to the god of us,
131018 ^ the [one] sitting on the throne, and to the lamb!
131026 ^ and all the angels stood around the throne, and the elders, and the four living creatures,
131041 ^ and they fell before the throne upon the faces of them,
131050 ^ and worshiped - god,
131054 ^ saying,
131055 ^ amen!
131056 ^ - blessing, and - glory, and - wisdom, and - thanksgiving, and - honor, and - power, and - strength, to the god of us, to the ages of the ages! amen.
131085 ^ and answered one of the elders,
131091 ^ saying to me,
131093 ^ these
131094 ^ - having been clothed with the robes - white, who are they,
131102 ^ and from where have they come?
131105 ^ and i said to him,
131108 ^ lord of me, you know.
131112 ^ and he said to me,
131115 ^ these are
131117 ^ the [ones] coming out of the tribulation - great,
131124 ^ and they have washed the robes of them
131129 ^ and made white them in the blood of the lamb.
131137 ^ because of this, they are before the throne - of god,
131145 ^ and serve him day and night in the temple of him;
131155 ^ and
131156 ^ the [one] sitting on the throne will tabernacle over them.
131164 ^ not they will hunger any more,
131167 ^ neither will they thirst anymore,
131170 ^ nor at all shall fall upon them the sun,
131177 ^ nor any scorching heat;
131180 ^ because the lamb - in the center of the throne will shepherd them,
131190 ^ and he will lead them to living fountains
131196 ^ of waters,
131197 ^ and will wipe away - god every tear from the eyes of them.’
131207 ^ and when he opened the seal - seventh,
131214 ^ there was silence in - heaven for about half an hour.
131221 ^ and i saw the seven angels
131226 ^ who before - god stand,
131231 ^ and were given to them seven trumpets.
131236 ^ and another angel came
131240 ^ and stood at the altar,
131245 ^ having a censer golden;
131248 ^ and was given to him incense much,
131253 ^ that he will offer [it] with the prayers of the saints all upon the altar - golden - before the throne.
131269 ^ and went up the smoke of the incense with the prayers of the saints out of [the] hand of the angel, before - god.
131286 ^ and took the angel the censer,
131292 ^ and filled it from the fire of the altar,
131300 ^ and cast [it] to the earth;
131305 ^ and there were thunders, and rumblings, and flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.
131314 ^ and the seven angels
131318 ^ - having the seven trumpets prepared themselves
131325 ^ that they might sound the trumpets.
131327 ^ and the first sounded [his] trumpet,
131331 ^ and there was hail, and fire
131336 ^ having been mixed with blood,
131339 ^ and it was cast upon the earth.
131344 ^ and a third of the earth was burned up,
131350 ^ and a third of the trees were burned up,
131356 ^ and all [the] grass green was burned up.
131361 ^ and the second angel sounded [his] trumpet,
131366 ^ and [something] like a mountain great,
131370 ^ with fire burning, was cast into the sea.
131376 ^ and became a third of the sea blood,
131383 ^ and died a third of the creatures - in the sea
131393 ^ - having life,
131396 ^ and a third of the ships were destroyed.
131402 ^ and the third angel sounded [his] trumpet,
131407 ^ and fell out of - heaven a star great,
131414 ^ burning like a torch.
131417 ^ and it fell upon a third of the rivers, and upon the springs of waters.
131430 ^ and the name of the star is called - wormwood.
131438 ^ and became a third of the waters into wormwood,
131446 ^ and many of the men died from the waters,
131454 ^ because they were made bitter.
131456 ^ and the fourth angel sounded [his] trumpet,
131461 ^ and was struck a third of the sun, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars,
131477 ^ so that should be darkened a third of them,
131482 ^ and the day not should appear [for] a third of it,
131490 ^ and the night likewise.
131494 ^ and i looked,
131496 ^ and i heard one eagle
131500 ^ flying in mid-heaven,
131503 ^ saying in a voice loud,
131506 ^ woe! woe! woe
131509 ^ to those dwelling on the earth, because of the remaining voices of the trumpet of the three angels
131523 ^ - being about
131525 ^ to sound [their] trumpets!
131526 ^ and the fifth angel sounded [his] trumpet,
131531 ^ and i saw a star
131534 ^ out of - heaven having fallen to the earth,
131541 ^ and was given to it the key of the pit of the abyss.
131550 ^ and he opened the pit of the abyss,
131556 ^ and went up smoke out of the pit, like [the] smoke of a furnace great,
131566 ^ and were darkened the sun and the air by the smoke of the pit.
131578 ^ and out of the smoke came forth locusts unto the earth,
131587 ^ and was given to them power,
131591 ^ like have power the scorpions of the earth.
131598 ^ and it was said to them,
131601 ^ that not they shall harm the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree,
131614 ^ if not the men
131618 ^ - not having the seal - of god on the foreheads.
131628 ^ and it was granted to them
131631 ^ that not they should kill them,
131635 ^ but that they shall torment [them] months five.
131640 ^ and the torment of them [was] like torment of a scorpion,
131647 ^ when it might strike a man.
131650 ^ and in the days those, will seek - men - death,
131660 ^ and not no more will find it;
131665 ^ and they will long
131667 ^ to die,
131668 ^ and shall flee - death from them.
131674 ^ and the appearance of the locusts [was] like horses
131681 ^ having been prepared for battle,
131684 ^ and upon the heads of them [were something] like crowns, like gold;
131693 ^ and the faces of them like [the] faces of men.
131700 ^ and they had hair like hair of women,
131706 ^ and the teeth of them like [those] of lions were.
131713 ^ and they had breastplates like breastplates of iron,
131719 ^ and the sound of the wings of them [was] as [the] sound of chariots of horses many
131730 ^ rushing into battle.
131733 ^ and they have tails like scorpions and stingers,
131740 ^ and in the tails of them [is] the power of them
131748 ^ to injure - men for months five.
131753 ^ they have over them a king, the angel of the abyss.
131761 ^ [the] name of him in hebrew [is] abaddon,
131765 ^ and in the greek, [the] name he has apollyon.
131772 ^ - woe the first has passed.
131777 ^ behold,
131778 ^ are coming still two woes after these things.
131784 ^ and the sixth angel sounded [his] trumpet,
131789 ^ and i heard voice one
131793 ^ from the four horns of the altar - golden - before - god, saying to the sixth angel,
131809 ^ the [one] having the trumpet,
131813 ^ release the four angels,
131817 ^ those having been bound at the river - great euphrates.
131825 ^ and were released the four angels
131830 ^ - having been prepared for the hour and day and month and year,
131841 ^ so that they might kill a third - of mankind.
131847 ^ and the number of the armies of the cavalry [was] twice ten thousand ten thousands;
131856 ^ i heard the number of them.
131860 ^ and thus i saw the horses in the vision,
131868 ^ and
131869 ^ those sitting on them, having breastplates fiery and hyacinthine and brimstone.
131880 ^ and the heads of the horses [were] like heads of lions,
131888 ^ and out of the mouths of them proceed fire, and smoke, and brimstone.
131899 ^ by - three plagues these was killed a third of mankind, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone,
131918 ^ - proceeding out of the mouths of them.
131924 ^ the for
131926 ^ powers of the horses in the mouths of them are,
131934 ^ and in the tails of them;
131939 ^ the for
131941 ^ tails of them [are] like serpents,
131945 ^ having heads,
131947 ^ and with them they injure.
131951 ^ and the rest of the men
131956 ^ who not were killed by the plagues these not even repented of the works of the hands of them,
131971 ^ so that not they will worship the demons, and the idols - golden and - silver and - bronze and - stone and - wooden,
131993 ^ which
131994 ^ neither to see are able,
131997 ^ nor to hear,
131999 ^ nor to walk.
132001 ^ and not they repented of the murders of them, nor of the sorceries of them, nor of the sexual immorality of them, nor of the thefts of them.
132023 ^ and i saw another angel mighty
132028 ^ coming down out of - heaven,
132032 ^ clothed with a cloud,
132034 ^ and a rainbow upon the head of him,
132041 ^ and the face of him [was] like the sun,
132048 ^ and the feet of him like pillars of fire,
132055 ^ and
132056 ^ having in the hand of him a little scroll
132062 ^ being open.
132063 ^ and he placed the foot of him - right upon the sea,
132073 ^ the and
132075 ^ left upon the earth.
132079 ^ and he cried out in a voice loud
132083 ^ as a lion roars.
132086 ^ and when he cried out,
132089 ^ sounded the seven thunders, the of themselves voice.
132096 ^ and when had spoken the seven thunders,
132102 ^ i was about
132103 ^ to write.
132104 ^ but i heard a voice
132107 ^ out of - heaven, saying,
132111 ^ seal
132112 ^ what have spoken the seven thunders,
132117 ^ and not them write.
132121 ^ and the angel
132124 ^ whom i saw
132126 ^ standing on the sea and on the land lifted up the hand of him the right to - heaven,
132143 ^ and he swore
132145 ^ by the [one] living to the ages of the ages,
132153 ^ who created - heaven and the things in it, and the earth and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it
132175 ^ -, delay no longer will there be!
132179 ^ but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel,
132188 ^ when he is about
132190 ^ to sound [the] trumpet,
132191 ^ then would be completed the mystery - of god,
132197 ^ as proclaimed the of himself servants, the prophets.
132204 ^ and the voice
132207 ^ that i heard
132209 ^ out of - heaven again was speaking with me,
132216 ^ and saying,
132218 ^ go,
132219 ^ take the little scroll
132222 ^ - having been opened in the hand of the angel
132229 ^ - standing upon the sea, and upon the land.
132238 ^ and i went to the angel,
132243 ^ saying to him
132245 ^ give me the little scroll.
132249 ^ and he says to me,
132252 ^ take
132253 ^ and eat it;
132256 ^ and it will make bitter your - stomach,
132261 ^ but in the mouth of you it will be sweet as honey.”
132270 ^ and i took the little scroll out of the hand of the angel,
132279 ^ and i ate it;
132282 ^ and it was in the mouth of me as honey sweet;
132291 ^ and when i had eaten it,
132295 ^ was made bitter the stomach of me.
132299 ^ and they say to me,
132302 ^ it is necessary
132303 ^ for you again to prophesy concerning peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings many.
132315 ^ and was given to me a measuring rod like a staff,
132321 ^ saying,
132322 ^ rise
132323 ^ and measure the temple - of god, and the altar, and
132333 ^ those worshiping in it.
132337 ^ and the courtyard - outside the temple, leave out,
132346 ^ and not it measure,
132350 ^ because it has been given [up] to the nations,
132354 ^ and the city - holy they will trample upon months forty and two.
132364 ^ and i will grant to the two witnesses of me,
132370 ^ and they will prophesy days a thousand two hundred sixty,
132376 ^ clothed in sackcloth.
132378 ^ these are the two olive trees and the two lampstands
132387 ^ - before the lord of the earth
132393 ^ standing.
132394 ^ and if anyone
132397 ^ them should desire to harm,
132400 ^ fire goes out of the mouth of them
132406 ^ and devours the enemies of them.
132411 ^ and if anyone should desire
132415 ^ them to harm,
132417 ^ thus it is necessary
132419 ^ for him to be killed.
132421 ^ these have the power
132425 ^ to shut the sky,
132428 ^ so that no rain shall fall in the days of the prophecy of them;
132437 ^ and power they have over the waters,
132443 ^ to turn them into blood,
132447 ^ and to strike the earth with every plague,
132454 ^ as often as if they might desire.
132457 ^ and when they shall have completed the testimony of them,
132463 ^ the beast
132465 ^ - coming up out of the abyss will make with them war,
132474 ^ and will overcome them,
132477 ^ and will kill them.
132480 ^ and the body of them [will be] upon the street of city the great,
132491 ^ which is called figuratively sodom and egypt,
132497 ^ where also the lord of them was crucified.
132503 ^ and gaze [those] of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations upon the bodies of them, days three and a half,
132521 ^ and
132522 ^ the bodies of them not they will allow to be put into a tomb.
132530 ^ and
132531 ^ those dwelling on the earth rejoice over them
132539 ^ and make merry,
132541 ^ and gifts will send to one another,
132545 ^ because these - two prophets have tormented
132551 ^ those dwelling upon the earth.
132556 ^ and after the three days and a half, [the] spirit of life from - god entered into them,
132571 ^ and they stood upon the feet of them;
132577 ^ and fear great fell
132581 ^ upon those beholding them.
132585 ^ and they heard a voice great
132589 ^ out of - heaven, saying to them,
132594 ^ come up here.
132596 ^ and they went up to - heaven in the cloud;
132604 ^ and beheld them the enemies of them.
132610 ^ and in that - hour there was an earthquake great,
132618 ^ and a tenth of the city fell,
132624 ^ and were killed in the earthquake, names of men thousand seven.
132633 ^ and the rest terrified became
132638 ^ and gave glory to the god of heaven.
132645 ^ the woe - second has passed.
132650 ^ behold,
132651 ^ the woe - third is coming quickly.
132657 ^ and the seventh angel sounded [his] trumpet,
132662 ^ and there were voices great in - heaven,
132669 ^ saying:
132670 ^ has become the kingdom of the world, [that] of the lord of us, and of the christ of him,
132682 ^ and he will reign to the ages of the ages.
132689 ^ and the twenty four elders
132694 ^ - before - god
132698 ^ sitting on the thrones of them fell upon the faces of them
132708 ^ and worshiped - god,
132712 ^ saying:
132713 ^ we give thanks to you, lord - god - almighty,
132720 ^ the [one] being,
132722 ^ and who was,
132725 ^ that you have taken the power of you - great,
132732 ^ and have begun to reign.
132734 ^ and the nations were enraged,
132738 ^ and came the wrath of you,
132743 ^ and the time
132746 ^ for the dead to be judged,
132749 ^ and to give the reward to the servants of you, the prophets, and to the saints,
132761 ^ and to those fearing the name of you, the small and the great,
132772 ^ and to destroy
132774 ^ those who are destroying the earth.
132778 ^ and was opened the temple - of god - in - heaven,
132788 ^ and was seen the ark of the covenant of him in the temple of him.
132799 ^ and there were flashes of lightning, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and hail great.
132811 ^ and a sign great appeared in - heaven:
132818 ^ a woman
132819 ^ clothed with the sun,
132822 ^ and the moon under the feet of her,
132829 ^ and on the head of her a crown of stars twelve,
132837 ^ and
132838 ^ in womb having.
132841 ^ and she cries out,
132843 ^ being in travail,
132844 ^ and being in pain
132846 ^ to bring forth.
132847 ^ and was seen another sign in - heaven,
132854 ^ and behold,
132856 ^ a dragon great, red
132859 ^ having heads seven, and horns ten,
132865 ^ and upon the heads of him, seven royal crowns.
132872 ^ and the tail of him drags a third of the stars of heaven,
132883 ^ and he cast them to the earth.
132889 ^ and the dragon stands before the woman
132896 ^ - being about
132898 ^ to bring forth,
132899 ^ so that when she should bring forth, the child of her
132905 ^ he might devour.
132906 ^ and she brought forth a son male,
132910 ^ who is about
132912 ^ to rule all the nations with a rod of iron;
132919 ^ and was caught up the child of her to - god, and to the throne of him.
132932 ^ and the woman fled into the wilderness,
132939 ^ where she has there a place
132943 ^ having been prepared by - god,
132947 ^ so that there they should nourish her days one thousand two hundred sixty.
132955 ^ and there was war in - heaven:
132961 ^ - michael and the angels of him
132967 ^ - warred against the dragon,
132972 ^ and the dragon warred [back],
132976 ^ and the angels of him.
132980 ^ and not had he strength,
132983 ^ nor a place was found
132986 ^ for them any longer in - heaven.
132991 ^ and was thrown [out] the dragon - great,
132997 ^ the serpent - ancient,
133001 ^ who is called [the] devil and - satan,
133007 ^ - deceiving the inhabited [world] whole. he was thrown down to the earth,
133016 ^ and the angels of him with him were thrown down.
133023 ^ and i heard a voice great
133027 ^ in - heaven, saying:
133031 ^ now have come the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of the god of us, and the authority the christ of him,
133050 ^ because has been thrown down the accuser of the brothers of us,
133057 ^ the [one] accusing them before the god of us day and night.
133067 ^ and they have overcome him by reason of the blood of the lamb, and by reason of the word of the testimony of them;
133083 ^ and not they have loved the life of them unto death.
133091 ^ because of this, rejoice o heavens, and
133097 ^ those in them
133100 ^ dwelling!
133101 ^ woe to the earth and the sea,
133107 ^ because has come down the devil to you,
133113 ^ having fury great,
133116 ^ knowing
133117 ^ that a short time he has.
133121 ^ and when saw the dragon
133126 ^ that he had been thrown down to the earth,
133131 ^ he pursued the woman
133134 ^ who had brought forth the male [child].
133138 ^ and were given to the woman the two wings of the eagle - great,
133149 ^ so that she could fly into the wilderness, into the place of her,
133158 ^ where she is nourished there a time, and times, and half a time from [the] face of the serpent.
133171 ^ and cast the serpent out of the mouth of him after the woman water as a river,
133185 ^ so that her carried away by a flood he might cause to be.
133189 ^ and helped the earth the woman,
133195 ^ and opened the earth the mouth of it
133202 ^ and swallowed up the river,
133206 ^ which had cast the dragon out of the mouth of him.
133214 ^ and was angry the dragon with the woman,
133221 ^ and went
133223 ^ to make war with the rest of the children of her
133231 ^ - keeping the commandments - of god
133237 ^ and holding the testimony of jesus.
133242 ^ and he stood upon the sand of the sea.
133249 ^ and i saw
133251 ^ out of the sea a beast
133255 ^ rising,
133256 ^ having horns ten, and heads seven,
133262 ^ and on the horns of it, ten royal crowns,
133269 ^ and upon the heads of it, names of blasphemy.
133276 ^ and the beast
133279 ^ that i saw was like a leopard,
133284 ^ and the feet of it like a bear’s,
133290 ^ and the mouth of it like [the] mouth of a lion.
133297 ^ and gave to it the dragon the power of him, and the throne of him, and authority great.
133312 ^ and one of the heads of it
133318 ^ [was] as having been slain to death.
133322 ^ and the wound of death of it was healed,
133329 ^ and marveled all the earth after the beast.
133337 ^ and they worshiped the dragon,
133341 ^ who had given - authority to the beast;
133347 ^ and they worshiped the beast,
133351 ^ saying,
133352 ^ who [is] like the beast?
133356 ^ and who is able
133359 ^ to make war against it?
133362 ^ and was given to it a mouth
133366 ^ speaking great things and blasphemy;
133370 ^ and was given to it authority
133374 ^ to act months forty and two.
133379 ^ and it opened the mouth of it unto blasphemies against - god,
133389 ^ to blaspheme the name of him, and the tabernacle of him,
133397 ^ those in - heaven
133401 ^ dwelling.
133402 ^ and there was given to it
133405 ^ to make war with the saints,
133410 ^ and to overcome them.
133413 ^ and was given to it authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.
133426 ^ and will worship it
133429 ^ all - dwelling on the earth,
133435 ^ of whom not have been written the names of them in the book - of life of the lamb
133448 ^ - having been slain, from [the] founding of [the] world.
133453 ^ if anyone has an ear,
133457 ^ let him hear.
133458 ^ if anyone [is to go] into captivity,
133462 ^ into captivity he goes;
133465 ^ if anyone
133467 ^ with [the] sword is to be killed,
133470 ^ he by [the] sword [is] to be killed.”
133474 ^ here is the endurance and the faith of the saints.
133483 ^ and i saw another beast
133487 ^ rising out of the earth,
133491 ^ and it had horns two like a lamb,
133497 ^ and it was speaking like a dragon.
133501 ^ and the authority of the first beast all it exercises on behalf of it,
133511 ^ and causes the earth and
133516 ^ those in it
133519 ^ dwelling,
133520 ^ that they will worship the beast - first,
133526 ^ of whom had been healed the wound - fatal of it.
133533 ^ and it works signs great,
133537 ^ so that even fire it should cause
133541 ^ out of - heaven to come down to the earth in the presence - of men.
133551 ^ and it deceives
133553 ^ those dwelling on the earth, by reason of the signs
133561 ^ that were given to it to perform before the beast,
133568 ^ telling
133569 ^ those dwelling on the earth
133574 ^ to make an image to the beast
133578 ^ that has the wound of the sword
133584 ^ and has lived.
133586 ^ and there was given to it
133589 ^ to give breath to the image of the beast,
133595 ^ so that also should speak the image of the beast,
133602 ^ and should cause
133604 ^ that
133605 ^ as many as if not would worship the image of the beast would be killed.
133614 ^ and it causes all the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the servants,
133634 ^ that it should give them a mark on the hand of them - right, or on the forehead of them,
133649 ^ and that no one should be able
133654 ^ to buy
133655 ^ or to sell,
133657 ^ if not
133659 ^ the [one] having the mark — the name of the beast, or the number of the name of it.
133673 ^ here the wisdom is.
133677 ^ the [one] having understanding, let him count the number of the beast;
133685 ^ number for
133687 ^ a man’s it is,
133689 ^ and the number [is] of it, six hundred sixty six.
133696 ^ and i looked,
133698 ^ and behold,
133700 ^ the lamb
133702 ^ was standing upon - mount zion,
133707 ^ and with him one hundred forty four thousand,
133714 ^ having the name of him and the name of the father of him
133724 ^ having been written on the foreheads of them.
133729 ^ and i heard a voice out of - heaven, as [the] sound of waters many, and as [the] sound of thunder loud.
133744 ^ and the voice
133747 ^ that i heard, [was] like that of harpists
133751 ^ harping with the harps of them.
133756 ^ and they are singing as a song new before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders.
133772 ^ and no one was able
133775 ^ to learn the song,
133778 ^ if not the one hundred forty four thousand
133785 ^ - having been redeemed from the earth.
133790 ^ these are
133792 ^ they who with women not
133796 ^ have not been defiled;
133797 ^ pure for they are,
133800 ^ these
133801 ^ - following the lamb
133805 ^ wherever - he shall go.
133808 ^ these have been redeemed out from - men [as] firstfruits - to god and to the lamb.
133819 ^ and in the mouth of them not was found a lie;
133827 ^ blameless they are.
133829 ^ and i saw another angel
133833 ^ flying in mid-heaven,
133836 ^ having [the] glad tidings everlasting
133839 ^ to preach
133840 ^ upon those dwelling on the earth, and upon every nation and tribe and tongue and people,
133856 ^ saying in a voice loud,
133860 ^ fear - god,
133863 ^ and give him glory,
133867 ^ because has come the hour of the judgment of him.
133874 ^ and worship
133876 ^ the [one] having made - heaven, and the earth, and sea, and springs of waters.
133888 ^ and another angel, a second followed,
133893 ^ saying,
133894 ^ fallen,
133895 ^ fallen is babylon the great,
133899 ^ who of the wine - of wrath for the immorality of her, she has given to drink all the gentiles.
133912 ^ and another angel, a third, followed them,
133918 ^ saying in a voice loud,
133922 ^ if anyone worships the beast and the image of it,
133931 ^ and receives a mark on the forehead of him, or upon the hand of him,
133943 ^ also he will drink of the wine of the anger - of god,
133953 ^ - having been mixed undiluted in the cup of the wrath of him;
133962 ^ and he will be tormented in fire and brimstone, before [the] angels holy, and before the lamb.
133975 ^ and the smoke of the torment of them to ages of ages goes up;
133985 ^ and not have rest day and night
133992 ^ those worshiping the beast and the image of it,
134000 ^ and if anyone receives the mark of the name of it.
134009 ^ here the endurance of the saints is,
134015 ^ those keeping the commandments - of god, and the faith of jesus.
134025 ^ and i heard a voice
134028 ^ out of - heaven, saying
134032 ^ write,
134033 ^ blessed [are] the dead
134036 ^ - in the lord
134039 ^ dying from now on.
134042 ^ yes,
134043 ^ says the spirit,
134046 ^ so that they will rest from the labors of them;
134052 ^ - for
134054 ^ the works of them follow with them.
134059 ^ and i looked,
134061 ^ and behold,
134063 ^ a cloud white,
134065 ^ and
134066 ^ upon the cloud is sitting [one] like [the] son of man,
134073 ^ having on the head of him a crown golden,
134080 ^ and in the hand of him a sickle sharp.
134087 ^ and another angel came out of the temple,
134094 ^ crying in a voice loud
134098 ^ to the [one] sitting on the cloud,
134103 ^ put forth the sickle of you
134107 ^ and reap,
134109 ^ because has come the hour
134113 ^ to reap,
134114 ^ because has ripened the harvest of the earth.
134120 ^ and swung
134122 ^ the [one] sitting upon the cloud the sickle of him upon the earth,
134133 ^ and was harvested the earth.
134137 ^ and another angel came out of the temple - in - heaven,
134148 ^ having also he a sickle sharp.
134153 ^ and another angel came out of the altar,
134160 ^ - having authority over the fire,
134166 ^ and he called in a voice loud
134170 ^ to the [one] having the sickle - sharp,
134176 ^ saying,
134177 ^ put forth your - sickle - sharp,
134183 ^ and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth,
134191 ^ because have fully ripened the grapes of it.
134196 ^ and put forth the angel the sickle of him to the earth,
134206 ^ and gathered the vine of the earth,
134212 ^ and cast [them] into the winepress of the wrath - of god - great.
134223 ^ and was trodden the winepress outside the city,
134230 ^ and flowed blood out of the winepress, as high as the bridles of the horses, to the distance of stadia one thousand six hundred.
134245 ^ and i saw another sign in - heaven,
134252 ^ great and wonderful, angels seven
134257 ^ having plagues seven — the last,
134262 ^ because in them was completed the wrath - of god.
134270 ^ and i saw [something] like a sea of glass
134275 ^ mingled with fire,
134277 ^ and those conquering over the beast, and of the image of it, and over the number of the name of it,
134295 ^ standing upon the sea of the glass,
134301 ^ having harps - of god.
134305 ^ and they are singing the song of moses, the servant of god, and the song of the lamb,
134319 ^ saying:
134320 ^ great and wonderful [are] the works of you, lord - god the almighty!
134331 ^ righteous and true [are] the ways of you, o king of the nations!
134341 ^ who no not should fear [you], o lord,
134346 ^ and will glorify the name of you?
134351 ^ for [you] alone [are] holy.
134354 ^ for all the nations will come
134359 ^ and will worship before you,
134363 ^ because the righteous acts of you have been revealed.
134368 ^ and after these things i looked,
134372 ^ and was opened the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in - heaven.
134383 ^ and came forth the seven angels
134388 ^ - having the seven plagues out of the temple,
134396 ^ having been clothed in linen pure bright,
134400 ^ and having been girded with around the chests sashes golden.
134407 ^ and one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven bowls golden
134420 ^ full of the wrath - of god,
134425 ^ the [one] living to the ages of the ages.
134432 ^ and was filled the temple with smoke from the glory - of god, and from the power of him;
134447 ^ and no one was able
134450 ^ to enter into the temple
134454 ^ until were completed the seven plagues of the seven angels.
134462 ^ and i heard [a] loud voice
134466 ^ from the temple saying to the seven angels,
134473 ^ go
134474 ^ and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath - of god into the earth.
134486 ^ and departed the first,
134490 ^ and poured out the bowl of him into the earth;
134498 ^ and came a sore, evil and grievous, upon the men
134507 ^ - having the mark of the beast
134513 ^ and those worshiping the image of it.
134519 ^ and the second poured out the bowl of him into the sea,
134529 ^ and it became blood, as of [one] dead;
134534 ^ and every soul living died
134539 ^ that was in the sea.
134543 ^ and the third poured out the bowl of him into the rivers and the springs of the waters,
134558 ^ and they became blood.
134561 ^ and i heard the angel of the waters
134567 ^ saying:
134568 ^ righteous are you,
134570 ^ the [one] being,
134572 ^ and - having been, o holy one,
134577 ^ because these things you have judged,
134580 ^ because [the] blood of saints and of prophets they have poured out,
134586 ^ and
134587 ^ blood to them you have given to drink;
134591 ^ worthy they are.
134593 ^ and i heard the altar
134597 ^ saying:
134598 ^ yes, lord - god - almighty,
134604 ^ true and righteous [are] the judgments of you.
134610 ^ and the fourth poured out the bowl of him upon the sun,
134620 ^ and there was given to it
134623 ^ to scorch - men with fire.
134628 ^ and were scorched the men with heat great,
134634 ^ and they cursed the name - of god,
134640 ^ the [one] having - authority over the plagues these;
134648 ^ and not did they repent
134651 ^ to give him glory.
134654 ^ and the fifth poured out the bowl of him upon the throne of the beast,
134666 ^ and became the kingdom of it
134671 ^ darkened,
134672 ^ and they were gnawing the tongues of them for the distress,
134680 ^ and they cursed the god of heaven on account of the distresses of them, and on account of the sores of them;
134695 ^ and not they did repent of the works of them.
134702 ^ and the sixth poured out the bowl of him upon the river - great - euphrates,
134716 ^ and was dried up the water of it,
134721 ^ so that might be prepared the way of the kings - of the rising of the sun.
134731 ^ and i saw [coming] out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, spirits three unclean, like frogs;
134755 ^ they are for spirits of demons
134759 ^ performing signs,
134761 ^ which go forth to the kings of the inhabited [world] whole,
134769 ^ to gather together them unto the battle of the day - great - of god the almighty.
134782 ^ behold,
134783 ^ i am coming like a thief.
134786 ^ blessed [is]
134787 ^ the [one] watching
134789 ^ and keeping the garments of him,
134794 ^ so that not naked he should walk
134798 ^ and they might see the shame of him.
134803 ^ and he gathered together them unto the place
134809 ^ - called in hebrew armageddon.
134813 ^ and the seventh poured out the bowl of him upon the air,
134823 ^ and came out a voice loud from the temple from the throne,
134833 ^ saying,
134834 ^ it is done!
134835 ^ and there were flashes of lightning, and voices, and thunders;
134842 ^ and an earthquake there was
134845 ^ great,
134846 ^ such as not had there been
134849 ^ since - men were upon the earth,
134856 ^ so great [was the] earthquake,
134858 ^ so mighty.
134860 ^ and was [split] the city - great into three parts,
134869 ^ and the cities of the nations fell;
134875 ^ and babylon the great was remembered before - god,
134883 ^ to give her the cup of the wine of the fury the wrath of him.
134894 ^ and every island fled,
134898 ^ and mountains not were to be found.
134902 ^ and a hail great, about a talent weight, comes down out of - heaven upon the men.
134914 ^ and blasphemed the men - god on account of the plague of the hail,
134925 ^ for severe is the plague of it exceedingly.
134932 ^ and came one of the seven angels
134939 ^ - having the seven bowls,
134944 ^ and spoke with me,
134948 ^ saying,
134949 ^ come here,
134950 ^ i will show you the punishment of the prostitute - great,
134958 ^ the [one] sitting upon waters many,
134963 ^ with whom have committed sexual immorality the kings of the earth,
134970 ^ and have been made drunk
134972 ^ those that dwelling on the earth with the wine of the sexual immorality of her.
134982 ^ and he carried away me into a wilderness in [the] spirit,
134989 ^ and i saw a woman
134992 ^ sitting upon a beast scarlet,
134996 ^ being full of names of blasphemy,
134999 ^ having heads seven and horns ten.
135005 ^ and the woman was
135009 ^ clothed in purple and scarlet,
135013 ^ and
135014 ^ adorned with gold and stone precious and pearls,
135021 ^ holding a cup golden in the hand of her,
135028 ^ being full of abominations and the impurity of the sexual immorality of her.
135036 ^ and upon the forehead of her a name
135042 ^ was written, a mystery: babylon the great, the mother of the prostitutes, and of the abominations of the earth.
135056 ^ and i saw the woman
135060 ^ being drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of jesus.
135073 ^ and i marveled,
135075 ^ having seen her, with wonder great.
135079 ^ and said to me the angel,
135084 ^ because of why did you marvel?
135087 ^ i will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast
135097 ^ - carrying her,
135100 ^ - having the seven heads, and the ten horns.
135109 ^ the beast
135111 ^ that you saw was,
135114 ^ and not is,
135117 ^ and is about
135119 ^ to come up out of the abyss
135123 ^ and into destruction go;
135127 ^ and will wonder
135129 ^ those dwelling on the earth,
135134 ^ whose not are written
135137 ^ - names in the book - of life from [the] foundation of [the] world,
135147 ^ seeing the beast
135150 ^ which was,
135152 ^ and not is,
135155 ^ and yet will be.
135157 ^ here [is] the mind
135160 ^ - having wisdom:
135163 ^ the seven heads, seven mountains are,
135169 ^ where the woman sits on them.
135175 ^ and kings seven there are.
135179 ^ the five are fallen,
135182 ^ the one is,
135185 ^ the other not yet has come;
135189 ^ and when he shall have come,
135192 ^ a little while him it behooves to remain.
135196 ^ and the beast
135199 ^ which was,
135201 ^ and not is, also
135205 ^ himself an eighth is,
135208 ^ and of the seven is,
135213 ^ and into destruction goes.
135217 ^ and the ten horns
135221 ^ which you saw, ten kings are,
135226 ^ who a kingdom not yet have received,
135230 ^ but authority as kings one hour receive, along with the beast.
135240 ^ these one mind have,
135244 ^ and the power and authority of themselves, to the beast they shall give up.
135253 ^ these with the lamb war will make,
135258 ^ and the lamb will overcome them,
135263 ^ because lord of lords he is,
135267 ^ and king of kings;
135270 ^ and those with him [are] called and chosen and faithful.
135279 ^ and he says to me,
135282 ^ the waters
135284 ^ that you saw,
135286 ^ where the prostitute sits, peoples and multitudes are,
135294 ^ and nations and tongues.
135298 ^ and the ten horns
135302 ^ that you saw, and the beast,
135307 ^ these will hate the prostitute,
135311 ^ and
135312 ^ desolate will make her,
135315 ^ and naked;
135317 ^ and the flesh of her they will eat,
135322 ^ and her they will burn with fire.
135327 ^ - for
135329 ^ god has put into the hearts of them
135335 ^ to do the purpose of him,
135339 ^ and to do one purpose,
135343 ^ and to give the kingdom of them to the beast,
135350 ^ until will be fulfilled the words - of god.
135356 ^ and the woman
135359 ^ whom you saw is the city - great,
135366 ^ - having kingship over the kings of the earth.
135374 ^ after these things i saw another angel
135379 ^ descending out of - heaven,
135383 ^ having authority great;
135386 ^ and the earth was illuminated from the glory of him.
135394 ^ and he cried out in a mighty voice,
135399 ^ saying:
135400 ^ fallen,
135401 ^ fallen is babylon the great!
135405 ^ and she has become a habitation of demons, and a prison of every spirit unclean, and a prison of every bird unclean, and a prison of every creature unclean
135424 ^ and having been hated.
135426 ^ for of the wine of the wrath of the sexual immorality of her, have drunk all the nations;
135439 ^ and the kings of the earth with her have committed sexual immorality;
135447 ^ and the merchants of the earth through the power of the sensuality of her have been enriched.
135459 ^ and i heard another voice
135463 ^ from - heaven, saying:
135467 ^ come the people of me, out of her,
135473 ^ so that not you may have fellowship in the sins of her,
135479 ^ and of the plagues of her so that not you may receive.
135487 ^ for have been heaped her - sins as high as - heaven,
135495 ^ and has remembered - god the iniquities of her.
135502 ^ give back to her
135504 ^ as also she has rendered;

135524 ^ so much as she has glorified herself
135527 ^ and lived in luxury,
135529 ^ as much give to her torment and misery,
135535 ^ because in the heart of herself she says
135541 ^ -, i sit [as] a queen,
135544 ^ and a widow never i am,
135548 ^ and mourning never not shall i see.
135553 ^ because of this, in one day will come the plagues of her, death and misery and famine;

135571 ^ because mighty [is the] lord - god,
135576 ^ the [one] having judged her.
135579 ^ and will weep
135581 ^ and will wail for her the kings of the earth,
135589 ^ the [ones] with her
135592 ^ having committed sexual immorality
135593 ^ and having lived luxuriously,
135595 ^ when they see the smoke of the burning of her,
135602 ^ from afar standing because of the fear of the torment of her,
135611 ^ saying:
135612 ^ woe, woe, the city - great, babylon, the city - strong!
135623 ^ for [in] one hour has come the judgment of you.
135630 ^ and the merchants of the earth weep
135636 ^ and mourn for her,
135640 ^ because the cargo of them, no one buys no longer —
135647 ^ cargo of gold, and of silver, and of stone precious, and of pearls; and of fine linen, and of purple, and of silk, and of scarlet; and all wood citron and every article of ivory and every article of wood most precious; and of bronze, and of iron, and of marble; and cinnamon, and spice, and incense, and myrrh, and frankincense; and wine, and oil, and finest flour, and wheat; and cattle, and sheep, and of horses, and of chariots; and of slaves and souls of men.
135715 ^ and the ripe fruit of you of the desire
135721 ^ of the soul are departed from you,
135726 ^ and all the sumptuous things and the splendid things have departed from you,
135736 ^ and no longer no not them they will find.
135742 ^ the merchants of these things
135745 ^ - having been enriched from her, from afar will stand, because of the fear of the torment of her,
135758 ^ weeping
135759 ^ and mourning,
135761 ^ saying:
135762 ^ woe, woe, the city - great,
135768 ^ - having been clothed with fine linen and purple and scarlet,
135775 ^ and having been adorned with gold and stone precious and pearl!
135784 ^ for [in] one hour has been brought to desolation - such great wealth.
135791 ^ and every shipmaster,
135794 ^ and all those to a place
135799 ^ sailing, and sailors, and
135803 ^ as many as the sea trade by, at a distance stood,
135810 ^ and were crying out,
135812 ^ seeing the smoke of the burning of her,
135818 ^ saying,
135819 ^ what [is] like the city - great?
135825 ^ and they cast dust upon the heads of them,
135832 ^ and they were crying out,
135834 ^ weeping
135835 ^ and mourning,
135837 ^ saying:
135838 ^ woe, woe, the city - great,
135844 ^ in which were enriched
135847 ^ all those having - ships in the sea through the wealth of her!
135859 ^ for in one hour she has been brought to desolation.
135863 ^ rejoice over her, o heaven, and - [you] saints, and - apostles, and - prophets,
135876 ^ because did judge - god the judgment for you against her.
135885 ^ and took up one angel a mighty stone, like a millstone great,
135894 ^ and cast [it] into the sea,
135899 ^ saying:
135900 ^ thus with violence will be cast down babylon the great city,
135907 ^ and no not shall be found any longer.

135927 ^ and any craftsmen of any craft no not shall be found in you any longer,
135938 ^ and [the] sound of a millstone no not shall be heard in you any longer.
135947 ^ and [the] light of lamp, no not shall shine in you any longer;
135956 ^ and [the] voice of a bridegroom and a bride, no not shall be heard in you any longer;
135967 ^ for the merchants of you were the great ones of the earth,
135976 ^ because by the sorcery of you were deceived all the nations.
135985 ^ and in her [the] blood of prophets and of saints was found,
135993 ^ and of all those having been slain on the earth.
136000 ^ after these things i heard [something] like a voice loud of a multitude great in - heaven,
136011 ^ crying out:
136012 ^ hallelujah!
136013 ^ the salvation and the glory and the power to the god of us!
136024 ^ for true and righteous [are] the judgments of him,

136045 ^ and he has avenged the blood of the servants of him, out of [the] hand of her.
136055 ^ and a second time they said:
136058 ^ hallelujah!

136352 ^ and he has upon the robe and upon the thigh of him a name
136363 ^ having been written:
136364 ^ king of kings and lord of lords.
136369 ^ and i saw one angel
136373 ^ standing in the sun,
136377 ^ and he cried out in a voice loud,
136382 ^ saying to all the birds
136386 ^ - flying in mid-heaven,
