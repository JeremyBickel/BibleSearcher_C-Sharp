50349 ^ that he was doing.
50351 ^ on his part however
50353 ^ jesus not did entrust himself to them,
50358 ^ because of - his
50361 ^ knowing all [men],
50363 ^ and because no need he had
50368 ^ that anyone should testify concerning the man;
50374 ^ he himself for knew
50377 ^ what was in the man.
50382 ^ there was now a man of the pharisees, nicodemus name to him, a ruler of the jews;
50394 ^ he came to him by night
50399 ^ and said to him,
50402 ^ rabbi, we know
50404 ^ that from god you have come, a teacher;
50409 ^ no one for is able
50412 ^ these - signs to do
54520 ^ than this [man] has done?
54523 ^ heard the pharisees the crowd
54528 ^ murmuring about him these things,
54532 ^ and sent the chief priests and the pharisees officers,
54540 ^ that they might seize him.
54543 ^ said therefore - jesus,
54547 ^ yet time a little with you i am,
54553 ^ and i go
54555 ^ to the [one] having sent me.
54559 ^ you will seek me
54561 ^ and not will find me;
54565 ^ and where am i,
54569 ^ you not are able
54572 ^ to come.
54573 ^ said therefore the jews among themselves,
56991 ^ of one possessed by a demon.
56992 ^ not a demon is able
56995 ^ of [the] blind [the] eyes to open?
56998 ^ took place at the time the feast of dedication, at - jerusalem.
57005 ^ winter it was,
57007 ^ and was walking - jesus in the temple in the porch - of solomon.
57019 ^ encircled therefore him the jews,
57024 ^ and they were saying to him,
57027 ^ until when the soul of us hold you in suspense?
57033 ^ if you are the christ,
57038 ^ tell us plainly.
57041 ^ answered them - jesus,
57045 ^ i told you,
57047 ^ and not you believe.
57050 ^ the works
57052 ^ that i do in the name of the father of me,
57061 ^ these bear witness concerning me.
57065 ^ but you not believe,
57069 ^ because not you are from among the sheep - of me.
57077 ^ the sheep - of me, the voice of me hear,
57085 ^ and i know them,
57088 ^ and they follow me;
57091 ^ and i give them life eternal;
57096 ^ and never not shall they perish, to the age,
57103 ^ and never will seize anyone them out of the hand of me.
57112 ^ the father of me
57115 ^ who has given [them] to me, than all greater is,
57121 ^ and no one is able
57124 ^ to seize [them] out of the hand the father.
57130 ^ i and the father one are.
57136 ^ took up again stones the jews,
57141 ^ that they might stone him.
57144 ^ answered them - jesus,
57148 ^ many works good i have shown you from the father;
57156 ^ because of which of these work, me do you stone?
57162 ^ answered him the jews,
57166 ^ for a good work not we do stone you,
57172 ^ but for blasphemy,
57175 ^ and because you,
57178 ^ a man being, make yourself god.
57183 ^ answered them - jesus,
57187 ^ not is it
57189 ^ written in the law of you
57194 ^ -: i said
57197 ^ gods you are’
57199 ^ if them he called gods,
57203 ^ to whom the word - of god came,
57210 ^ and not is able
57213 ^ to be broken the scripture,
57216 ^ [of him] whom the father sanctified
57220 ^ and sent into the world, you do say
57227 ^ -, you blaspheme,
57229 ^ because i said,
57231 ^ son - of god i am’?
57235 ^ if not i do the works of the father of me,
57243 ^ not believe me.
57246 ^ if however i do,
57249 ^ even if me not you believe,
57253 ^ the works believe,
57256 ^ so that you may know
57258 ^ and may understand
57260 ^ that in me [is] the father,
57265 ^ and i in the father.
57269 ^ they were seeking therefore
57271 ^ him again to seize,
57274 ^ but he went forth out of the hand of them.
57280 ^ and he departed again beyond the jordan, to the place
57289 ^ where was john - at first
57294 ^ baptizing.
57295 ^ and he stayed there.
57298 ^ and many came to him
57303 ^ and were saying
57305 ^ -, john indeed sign did
57310 ^ no;
57311 ^ everything however
58304 ^ of those reclining with him.
58309 ^ - therefore
58311 ^ mary,
58312 ^ having taken a litra of fragrant oil of nard pure of great price, anointed the feet - of jesus
58323 ^ and wiped with the hair of her the feet of him;
58331 ^ the now
58333 ^ house was filled with the fragrance of the oil.
58340 ^ says however judas - iscariot, one of the disciples of him,
58350 ^ - being about
58352 ^ him to betray,
58354 ^ because of why this - fragrant oil not was sold for three hundred denarii
58363 ^ and given to [the] poor?
58366 ^ he said however this,
58369 ^ not because for the poor he was caring to him,
58376 ^ but because a thief he was,
58380 ^ and
58381 ^ the money bag having,
58384 ^ that being put into [it] he used to pilfer.
58387 ^ said therefore - jesus,
58391 ^ leave alone her,
58393 ^ so that for the day of the burial of me she may keep it;
58402 ^ the poor for always you have with you;
58409 ^ me however not always you have.
58414 ^ knew therefore - a crowd great of the jews
58422 ^ that there he is;
58425 ^ and they came, not because of - jesus only,
58432 ^ but that also - lazarus they might see,
58438 ^ whom he had raised out from [the] dead.
58442 ^ took counsel however the chief priests
58446 ^ that also - lazarus they might kill,
58451 ^ because many on account of him were going away
58456 ^ of the jews
58458 ^ and were believing in - jesus.
58463 ^ on the next day the crowd great
58468 ^ - having come to the feast,
58473 ^ having heard
58474 ^ that is coming - jesus into jerusalem, took the branches of the palm trees
58485 ^ and went out to meet him,
58490 ^ and were shouting:
58492 ^ hosanna!”
59639 ^ of those reclining
59641 ^ to what he spoke to him.
59645 ^ some for were thinking,
59648 ^ since the money bag had judas,
59653 ^ that is saying to him - jesus,
59658 ^ buy
59659 ^ what things need [of] we have for the feast,
59665 ^ or to the poor that something he should give.
66650 ^ of those having heard the word believed,
66655 ^ and became the number of the men about thousand five.
66664 ^ it came to pass then
66666 ^ on the next day were gathered together their - rulers and - elders and - scribes in jerusalem,
66681 ^ and annas the high priest, and caiaphas, and john, and alexander,
66691 ^ and as many as were of descent high-priestly.
66697 ^ and
66698 ^ having placed them in the midst, they began to inquire,
66704 ^ in what power or in what name did this you?
66714 ^ then peter,
66716 ^ having been filled with [the] spirit holy, said to them,
66722 ^ rulers of the people and elders, if we this day are being examined as to a good work [to the] man ailing,
66735 ^ by what [means] he has been healed,
66739 ^ known let it be to all you and to all the people of israel
66748 ^ that in the name of jesus christ of nazareth,
66756 ^ whom you crucified,
66759 ^ whom - god raised out from [the] dead,
66765 ^ in him this [man] stands before you sound.
66772 ^ this is the stone
66776 ^ - having been rejected by you, the builders,
66782 ^ which has become into head of [the] corner.’
66787 ^ and not there is in other no one the salvation,
66795 ^ not for name is there
66799 ^ another under - heaven
66803 ^ - having been given among men
66807 ^ by which it behooves
66810 ^ to be saved us.
66812 ^ seeing now
66814 ^ the - of peter boldness,
66818 ^ and of john,
66820 ^ and having understood
66822 ^ that men unschooled they are,
66826 ^ and ordinary, they were astonished.
66829 ^ they recognized then them,
66832 ^ that with - jesus they had been.
69562 ^ of those having spirits unclean,
69852 ^ of which you have spoken.
69854 ^ they indeed therefore
69857 ^ having earnestly testified,
69858 ^ and having spoken the word of the lord, traveled back to jerusalem,
69867 ^ to many then
69869 ^ villages of the samaritans they were preaching the gospel.
69873 ^ an angel now
69875 ^ of [the] lord spoke to philip,
69879 ^ saying,
69880 ^ rise up
69881 ^ and go toward [the] south, to the road
69888 ^ - going down from jerusalem to gaza.
69894 ^ this is [the] desert [road].
69897 ^ and
69898 ^ having risen up, he went.
69900 ^ and behold,
69902 ^ a man an ethiopian, a eunuch, a potentate of candace queen of [the] ethiopians,
69909 ^ who was over all the treasure of her,
69916 ^ who had come
69918 ^ to worship to jerusalem,
69921 ^ he was then
69923 ^ returning
69924 ^ and sitting in the chariot of him,
69930 ^ and he was reading the prophet isaiah.
69935 ^ said then the spirit - to philip,
69941 ^ go near
69942 ^ and join yourself to the chariot this.
77131 ^ of those having believed were coming,
77134 ^ confessing
77135 ^ and declaring the deeds of them.
77140 ^ many now
77142 ^ of those the magic arts
77145 ^ having practiced,
77146 ^ having brought the books, burned [them] before all.
77152 ^ and they counted up the prices of them
77157 ^ and found [it] of silverlings myriads five.
77162 ^ thus with might of the lord the word continued to increase
77170 ^ and prevail.
77172 ^ after now were fulfilled these things,
77176 ^ purposed - paul in the spirit,
77911 ^ of that being profitable,
77913 ^ - not
77915 ^ to declare to you,
77917 ^ and to teach you publicly and from house to house,
77924 ^ earnestly testifying to the jewish both and to greeks, - in god repentance and faith in the lord of us, jesus.
77940 ^ and now, behold,
78596 ^ - having believed,
78598 ^ and all zealous ones for the law are.
78604 ^ they have been informed now about you,
78608 ^ that apostasy you teach,
78611 ^ from moses, those among the gentiles all jews,
78619 ^ telling
78620 ^ not to circumcise them the children,
78625 ^ nor in the customs to walk.
78629 ^ what then is it?
78632 ^ certainly they will hear
78634 ^ that you have come.
78636 ^ this therefore do you
78639 ^ what to you we say.
78642 ^ there are with us men four,
78646 ^ a vow having on themselves.
79206 ^ of the [one] speaking to me.
79209 ^ i said then,
79211 ^ what shall i do, lord?
79214 ^ - and
79216 ^ the lord said to me,
89642 ^ what except has accomplished christ through me, unto [the] obedience of [the] gentiles, by word and deed, in [the] power of signs and wonders, in [the] power of [the] spirit of god;
89663 ^ so as for me from jerusalem, and around unto - illyricum, to have fully proclaimed the gospel - of christ,
89677 ^ thus now being ambitious
89680 ^ to preach the gospel
89681 ^ not where had been named christ,
89685 ^ so that not upon another’s foundation i might build.
89691 ^ rather, as it has been written:
92970 ^ to keep - the virgin, well he will do.
92976 ^ so then also,
92978 ^ the [one] marrying the own virgin, well does;
92985 ^ and
92986 ^ the [one] not
92988 ^ marrying, better will do.
92991 ^ a wife is bound
92993 ^ for as long as time may live the husband of her;
93000 ^ if however shall have died the husband,
93005 ^ free she is
122848 ^ of the [one] out of darkness you
122852 ^ having called, to the marvelous of him light,
122858 ^ who once [were] not a people,
122862 ^ now however [the] people of god;
122866 ^ those not
122868 ^ having received mercy,
122869 ^ now however
122871 ^ having received mercy.
122872 ^ beloved, i exhort [you] as aliens and sojourners,
122878 ^ to abstain from fleshly desires,
122882 ^ which war against the soul,
122887 ^ the conduct of you among the gentiles keeping
122894 ^ honorable,
122895 ^ so that
122896 ^ wherein which they speak against you as evildoers,
122902 ^ through the good deeds having witnessed, they may glorify - god in [the] day of visitation.
122913 ^ be in subjection to every human institution for the sake of the lord,
122920 ^ whether to [the] king
122922 ^ as being supreme,
