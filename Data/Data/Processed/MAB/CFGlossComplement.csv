9461 ^ others now
9463 ^ jeremiah, or one of the prophets.

9470 ^ you but

10856 ^ the things having taken place, they were grieved deeply,
10860 ^ and
10861 ^ having gone, narrated to master of themselves all
10867 ^ that having taken place.
10869 ^ then
10870 ^ having called to him, the master of him says to him,

10937 ^ when had finished - jesus the words these,
10944 ^ he withdrew from - galilee
10948 ^ and came to the region - of judea beyond the jordan.
10958 ^ and followed him crowds great,
10963 ^ and he healed them there.
10967 ^ and came to him pharisees,
10971 ^ testing him
10973 ^ and saying,
10975 ^ if is it lawful for a man
10978 ^ to divorce the a wife to him for every cause?
10985 ^ which now
10987 ^ answering, he said,
10989 ^ not have you read
10991 ^ that
10992 ^ the [one] having created, from [the] beginning male and female made them’
11001 ^ and said,
11003 ^ on account of this will leave a man the father and the mother
11012 ^ and be joined with the wife of him,
11017 ^ and will become the two into flesh one’
11024 ^ so that no longer are they two,
11028 ^ but flesh one.
11031 ^ what therefore - god united together, man not let separate.
11039 ^ they say to him,
11041 ^ why then moses did command
11045 ^ to give a roll of divorce,
11048 ^ and to send away her?
11051 ^ he says to them
11053 ^ -, moses in view of the hardness of heart of you allowed you
11061 ^ to divorce the wives of you;
11065 ^ from [the] beginning however not was [it] this way.
11071 ^ i say now to you
11074 ^ that
11075 ^ whoever - shall divorce - wife of him
11081 ^ except for sexual immorality,
11084 ^ and shall marry another, commits adultery.”
11088 ^ say to him the disciples of him
11093 ^ if this is the case of the man with the wife,
11103 ^ not it is better
11105 ^ to marry.
11106 ^ - and he said to them,
11110 ^ not all receive the word this,
11116 ^ but only [those]
11117 ^ to whom it has been given.
11119 ^ there are for eunuchs
11122 ^ who from [the] womb of [their] mother were born thus,
11128 ^ and there are eunuchs
11131 ^ who were made eunuchs by - men,
11136 ^ and there are eunuchs
11139 ^ who made eunuchs of themselves for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens.
11241 ^ - not
11243 ^ shall you murder,
11244 ^ not shall you commit adultery,
11246 ^ not shall you steal,
11248 ^ not shall you bear false witness,
11250 ^ you shall honor the father and the mother,
11256 ^ and you shall love - neighbor of you
11261 ^ as yourself.’
11263 ^ says to him the young man,
11267 ^ all these things i have kept.
11270 ^ what yet lack i?
11273 ^ was saying to him - jesus,
11277 ^ if you desire
11279 ^ perfect to be,
11281 ^ go,
11282 ^ sell
11283 ^ of you the possessing,
11286 ^ and give to the poor,
11290 ^ and you will have treasure in [the] heavens;
11295 ^ and come,
11297 ^ follow me.
11684 ^ what i will to do with that which [is] mine?
11690 ^ or the eye of you envious is,
11696 ^ because i generous am?
11700 ^ thus will be the last first,
11705 ^ and the first, last.”
11709 ^ and
11710 ^ going up - jesus to jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside themselves,
11721 ^ and on the way he said to them,
11727 ^ behold,
11728 ^ we go up to jerusalem,
11731 ^ and the son - of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and scribes,
11741 ^ and they will condemn him [to] death,
11745 ^ and they will betray him the gentiles
11750 ^ unto, - to mock
11753 ^ and to flog
11755 ^ and to crucify;
11757 ^ and the third day he will rise again.
11762 ^ then came to him the mother of the sons of zebedee with the sons of her,
11774 ^ kneeling down,
11775 ^ and asking something from him.
11780 ^ - and he said to her,
11784 ^ what do you desire?
11786 ^ she says to him,
11788 ^ say
11789 ^ that might sit these - two sons of mine,
11796 ^ one on [the] right hand of you
11800 ^ and one on [the] left hand of you, in the kingdom of you.
11983 ^ what do you desire i should do unto you?
11987 ^ they say to him,
11989 ^ lord, that might be opened the eyes of us.
12162 ^ blessed is
12163 ^ the [one] coming in [the] name of [the] lord!”
12168 ^ hosanna in the highest!”
12172 ^ and having entered of him into jerusalem,
12177 ^ was stirred all the city,
12181 ^ saying,
12182 ^ who is this?
12185 ^ - and
12187 ^ the crowds were saying,
12189 ^ this is the prophet, jesus, the [one] from nazareth - of galilee.
12199 ^ and entered jesus into the temple
12205 ^ and cast out all
12208 ^ those selling
12210 ^ and buying in the temple,
12215 ^ and the tables of the money changers he overturned,
12221 ^ and the seats
12224 ^ of those selling the doves.
12228 ^ and he says to them,
12231 ^ it has been written:
12232 ^ the house of me a house of prayer will be called.’
12238 ^ you however it have made a den of robbers.’
12244 ^ and came to him blind and lame in the temple,
12253 ^ and he healed them.
14184 ^ blessed [is]
14185 ^ the [one] coming in [the] name of [the] lord.’
14190 ^ and
14191 ^ having gone forth - jesus from the temple, he was going away,
14198 ^ and came to [him] the disciples of him
14203 ^ to point out to him the buildings of the temple.
14209 ^ - and
14211 ^ answering, he said to them,
14214 ^ not do you see these things all?
14218 ^ truly i say to you,
14221 ^ none not even shall be left here stone upon stone,
14228 ^ which not will be thrown down.
14231 ^ [as] was sitting now he upon the mount - of olives,
14239 ^ came to him the disciples in private,
14245 ^ saying,
14246 ^ tell us,
14248 ^ when these things will be?
14251 ^ and what [is] the sign - of your coming and of the consummation of the age?
14262 ^ and
14263 ^ answering, - jesus said to them,
14268 ^ take heed,
14269 ^ lest anyone you mislead.
14273 ^ many for will come in the name of me,
14280 ^ saying,
14281 ^ i am the christ,
14285 ^ and many they will mislead.
14288 ^ you will begin then
14290 ^ to hear of wars and rumors of wars.
14295 ^ behold,
14296 ^ not be alarmed;
14298 ^ it is necessary for
14300 ^ to take place,
14301 ^ but not yet is the end.
14306 ^ will rise up for nation against nation,
14311 ^ and kingdom against kingdom;
14315 ^ and there will be famines and earthquakes in [various] places.
14322 ^ all then
14324 ^ these [are] [the] beginning of birth pains.
14327 ^ then will they deliver you to tribulation,
14332 ^ and will kill you,
14335 ^ and you will be
14337 ^ hated by all the nations on account of the name of me.
14346 ^ and then will fall away many,
14350 ^ and one another they will betray,
14353 ^ and will hate one another;
14356 ^ and many false prophets will arise
14360 ^ and will mislead many.
14363 ^ and
14364 ^ because - is to be multiplied - lawlessness, will grow cold the love of the many.
15451 ^ - for having, to everyone will be given,
15456 ^ and he will have in abundance;
15959 ^ what are you willing me to give,
15963 ^ and i to you will betray him?
15967 ^ - and they appointed to him thirty pieces of silver.
15973 ^ and from that time, he was seeking an opportunity
15978 ^ that him he might betray.
15981 ^ on the now
15983 ^ first [day] of the unleavened [bread], came the disciples - to jesus,
15991 ^ saying,
15992 ^ where wish you [that]
15994 ^ we should prepare for you
15996 ^ to eat the passover?
15999 ^ - and he said,
16002 ^ go into the city unto a certain man
16009 ^ and tell him
16012 ^ the teacher says,
16015 ^ the time of me near is;
16020 ^ with you i will keep the passover, with the disciples of me.’
16029 ^ and did the disciples
16033 ^ as directed them - jesus,
16038 ^ and prepared the passover.
16042 ^ evening now having arrived,
16045 ^ he was reclining with the twelve.
16049 ^ and [as] they were eating, to them
16052 ^ he said,
16053 ^ truly i say to you
16056 ^ that one of you will betray me.
16062 ^ and
16063 ^ being grieved exceedingly, they began
16066 ^ to say to him, one each,
16070 ^ not i is it, lord?
16074 ^ - and
16076 ^ answering he said,
17240 ^ whom will you [that] i shall release to you?
17244 ^ jesus - barabbas,
17247 ^ or jesus,
17249 ^ who is called christ?
17252 ^ he knew for
17254 ^ that through envy they delivered up him.
17259 ^ as was sitting now he on the judgment seat,
17265 ^ sent to him the wife of him,
17271 ^ saying,
17272 ^ [let there be] nothing between you and the righteous [man] that;
17278 ^ many things for i suffered today in a dream because of him.
17286 ^ - and
17288 ^ the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds
17295 ^ that they should ask for - barabbas,
17299 ^ - and
17301 ^ jesus should destroy.
17309 ^ which do you desire of the two, i release to you?
17316 ^ - and they said,
17319 ^ - barabbas.
17321 ^ says to them - pilate,
17325 ^ what then should i do with jesus,
17329 ^ who is called christ?
17332 ^ they say all,
17334 ^ let [him] be crucified.
17335 ^ - and he said,
17338 ^ what for
17340 ^ evil did he commit?
17342 ^ - and all the more they kept crying out,
17346 ^ saying,
17347 ^ let [him] be crucified.
17348 ^ having seen now - pilate
17352 ^ that nothing it availed,
17355 ^ but rather a riot is arising,
17359 ^ having taken water, he washed the hands before the crowd,
17367 ^ saying,
17368 ^ guiltless i am of the blood of this.
17374 ^ for yourselves you will see.”
17376 ^ and
17377 ^ answering, all the people said,
17382 ^ the blood of him [be] on us, and on the children of us.
17392 ^ then he released to them - barabbas;
17397 ^ - and
17399 ^ jesus
17400 ^ having flogged, he delivered up [him],
17402 ^ that he might be crucified.
17404 ^ then the soldiers of the governor,
17409 ^ having taken with [them] - jesus to the praetorium, gathered before him all the cohort.
17421 ^ and
17422 ^ having stripped him, a robe scarlet they put around him.
17428 ^ and
17429 ^ having twisted together a crown of thorns, they put [it] on the head of him,
17438 ^ and a reed in the right hand of him;
17444 ^ and
17445 ^ having bowed the knees before him, they mocked him,
17450 ^ saying,
17451 ^ hail, king of the jews!
17455 ^ and
17456 ^ having spit upon him, they took the reed
17462 ^ and kept striking [him] on the head of him.
17468 ^ and when they had mocked him,
17472 ^ they took off him the robe,
17476 ^ and they put on him the garments of him
17482 ^ and led away him
17485 ^ to - crucify [him].
17614 ^ himself not is he able to save.
17618 ^ king of israel he is.
17621 ^ let him descend now from the cross,
17626 ^ and we will believe in him.
17630 ^ he trusted on - god.
17634 ^ let him deliver now
17636 ^ if he wants him.
17639 ^ he said for
17641 ^ -, of god i am
17644 ^ [the] son.
17645 ^ - and
17647 ^ likewise even the robbers,
17651 ^ those having been crucified with him, were upbraiding him.
17657 ^ from then
17659 ^ [the] sixth hour, darkness was over all the land, until [the] hour ninth.
17670 ^ about then
17672 ^ the ninth hour, cried out - jesus in a voice loud,
17680 ^ saying,
17681 ^ eli, eli, lema sabachthani?
17685 ^ that is,
17687 ^ god of me, god of me, so that why me have you forsaken?”
17694 ^ some then
23504 ^ whom me do pronounce - men to be?
23510 ^ - and they answered him,
23514 ^ saying
23515 ^ -, john the baptist;
23519 ^ and others,
23521 ^ elijah;
23522 ^ others now
23524 ^ -, one of the prophets.
23528 ^ and he was questioning them,
23532 ^ you however,
23534 ^ whom me do pronounce to be?
24701 ^ what therefore - god has joined together, man not let separate.
24709 ^ and in the house again, the disciples concerning this were asking him.
24720 ^ and he says to them,
24723 ^ whoever - shall divorce the wife of him,
24729 ^ and shall marry another, commits adultery against her.
24735 ^ and if a woman,
24738 ^ having divorced the husband of her, should marry another,
24744 ^ she commits adultery.
24745 ^ and they were bringing to him little children,
24749 ^ that them he might touch.
24752 ^ - but
24754 ^ the disciples rebuked them.
24890 ^ as much as you have sell,
24893 ^ and give to the poor,
24897 ^ and you will have treasure in heaven;
24902 ^ and come, follow me.
24906 ^ - and
24908 ^ having been sad at the word, he went away
24913 ^ grieving;
24914 ^ he was [one] for
24916 ^ having possessions many.
24919 ^ and
24920 ^ having looked around, - jesus says the disciples of him,
24927 ^ how difficultly
24929 ^ those - riches
24932 ^ having, into the kingdom - of god will enter!
24939 ^ - and
24941 ^ the disciples were astonished at the words of him.
24947 ^ - but
24949 ^ jesus,
24950 ^ again answering, says to them,
24954 ^ children, how difficult it is
24958 ^ into the kingdom - of god to enter!
24964 ^ easier it is
24966 ^ [for] a camel through the eye of the needle to pass,
24973 ^ than [for] a rich man into the kingdom - of god to enter.
24981 ^ - and exceedingly they were astonished,
24985 ^ saying among themselves,
24988 ^ then who is able
24991 ^ to be saved?
25187 ^ what do you desire me to do for you?
25192 ^ - and they said to him,
25196 ^ grant to us
25198 ^ that one of [us] at [your] right hand, and one at [your] left hand, we might sit in the glory of you.
25212 ^ - and
25214 ^ jesus said to them,
25217 ^ not you know
25219 ^ what you ask.
25221 ^ are you able
25222 ^ to drink the cup
25225 ^ which i drink,
25228 ^ and the baptism
25231 ^ which i am baptized , to be baptized [with]?
25235 ^ - and they said to him,
25239 ^ we are able.
25240 ^ - and
25242 ^ jesus said to them,
25245 ^ the cup
25247 ^ which i drink, you will drink;
25251 ^ and the baptism
25254 ^ which i am baptized , you will be baptized [with];
25444 ^ what to you do you desire i should do?
25448 ^ - and
25450 ^ the blind [man] said to him,
25453 ^ rabboni, that i may receive sight.
25456 ^ and - jesus said to him,
25461 ^ go,
25462 ^ the faith of you has healed you.
25467 ^ and immediately he received sight,
25470 ^ and he began following him on the way.
25476 ^ and when they drew near to jerusalem, to bethphage and bethany, near the mount - of olives,
25490 ^ he sends two of the disciples of him
25495 ^ and says to them,
25498 ^ go into the village, - before you,
25505 ^ and immediately,
25507 ^ entering into it, you will find a colt
25512 ^ having been tied,
25513 ^ upon which no one not yet
25517 ^ of men has sat;
25519 ^ having untied it,
25521 ^ also bring [it].
25523 ^ and if anyone to you says,
25528 ^ why are you doing this?’
25531 ^ say,
25532 ^ the lord of it need has,
25537 ^ and soon it he will send back here.
25543 ^ and they departed
25545 ^ and found the colt
25548 ^ having been tied at the door outside, by the street,
25555 ^ and they untied it.
25558 ^ and some
25560 ^ of those there
25562 ^ standing were saying to them,
25565 ^ what are you doing
25567 ^ untying the colt?
25570 ^ - and they spoke to them
25574 ^ as had commanded - jesus,
25578 ^ and they allowed them.
25581 ^ and they led the colt to - jesus,
25588 ^ and they cast upon it the cloaks of them,
25594 ^ and he sat on it.
25598 ^ and many the cloaks of them spread on the road;
25607 ^ others then, branches
25610 ^ having been cut down from the fields.
25614 ^ and
25615 ^ those going before
25617 ^ and those following were crying out:
25621 ^ hosanna!”
25622 ^ blessed is
25623 ^ the [one] coming in [the] name of [the] lord!”
25628 ^ blessed [is] the
25630 ^ coming kingdom of the father of us, david!
25636 ^ hosanna in the highest!”
25640 ^ and he entered into jerusalem, into the temple,
25647 ^ and
25648 ^ having looked around on all things,
25650 ^ late already being the hour, he went out to bethany with the twelve.
25661 ^ and on the next day, having gone out they from bethany,
25668 ^ he was hungry.
25669 ^ and
25670 ^ having seen a fig tree from afar,
27432 ^ what now to you i say, to all i say:
27438 ^ watch!
27439 ^ it would be now the passover and the [feast of] unleavened bread, after two days.
27449 ^ and were seeking the chief priests and the scribes
27456 ^ how,
27457 ^ him by stealth having taken, they might kill [him].
27462 ^ they were saying for,
27464 ^ not during the feast,
27468 ^ lest ever there will be an uproar of the people.
27473 ^ and being of him in bethany in the house of simon the leper,
27484 ^ having reclined of him,
27486 ^ came a woman
27488 ^ having an alabaster flask of fragrant oil of nard pure of great price;
27565 ^ what she could, she did.
27568 ^ she came beforehand
27569 ^ to anoint the body of me for the burial.
27576 ^ truly now i say to you,
27580 ^ wherever if shall be proclaimed the gospel in whole the world,
27589 ^ also
27590 ^ what has done this [woman] will be spoken of for a memorial of her.
27597 ^ and judas iscariot, - one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests,
27608 ^ that him he might betray to them.
27612 ^ - and
27614 ^ having heard, they rejoiced,
27616 ^ and promised
27618 ^ him money to give.
27621 ^ and he was seeking
27623 ^ how him conveniently he might deliver up.
27627 ^ and on the first day - of unleavened [bread],
27633 ^ when the passover lamb they were to sacrifice, say to him the disciples of him,
27642 ^ where do you desire [that],
29029 ^ himself not he is able to save.
29033 ^ the christ, the king of israel, let him descend now from the cross,
29043 ^ that we might see
29045 ^ and believe!
29047 ^ and
29048 ^ those being crucified with him were upbraiding him.
29054 ^ and having arrived [the] hour sixth,
29058 ^ darkness came over all the land, until [the] hour ninth.
29067 ^ and at the ninth hour, cried out - jesus in a voice loud,
29076 ^ eloi, eloi, lema sabachthani?
29080 ^ which is
29082 ^ translated,
29083 ^ - god of me, - god of me, to why have you forsaken me?”
29093 ^ and some
29095 ^ of those standing by,
29097 ^ having heard, were saying,
29099 ^ behold,
29100 ^ elijah he calls.
30328 ^ blessed are you among women,
30332 ^ and
30333 ^ blessed is the fruit of the womb of you.
30339 ^ and from where to me this,
30343 ^ that should come the mother of the lord of me to me?
30352 ^ behold for,
30354 ^ as came the voice of the greeting of you into the ears of me,
30365 ^ leaped in exultation the baby in the womb of me.
30374 ^ and blessed [is]
30376 ^ the [one] having believed
30378 ^ that there will be a fulfillment
30381 ^ to the things spoken to her from [the] lord.
30386 ^ and said mary:
30389 ^ magnifies the soul of me the lord,
30395 ^ and rejoices the spirit of me in - god, the savior of me.
30406 ^ for he has looked upon the humiliation of the handmaiden of him.
30414 ^ behold for
30416 ^ from - henceforth will count blessed me all the generations.
30424 ^ for has done to me great things the mighty one.
30430 ^ and holy [is] the name of him.
30435 ^ and the mercy of him [is] to generations and generations,
30443 ^ to those fearing him.
30446 ^ he has shown strength with the arm of him,
30451 ^ he has scattered [the] proud in [the] thought of heart of them.
30456 ^ he has brought down rulers from thrones,
30460 ^ and exalted [the] humble.
30463 ^ [those] hungering he has filled with good things,
30466 ^ and
30467 ^ [those] being rich he has sent away empty.
30470 ^ he has helped israel [the] servant of him,
30474 ^ remembering mercy,
30476 ^ as he spoke to the fathers of us, - to abraham and to the descendants of him to the age.
30491 ^ dwelt then mary with her about months three,
30499 ^ and returned to the home of her.
30505 ^ to now
30507 ^ elizabeth was fulfilled the time
30511 ^ - to give birth for her,
30514 ^ and she bore a son.
30517 ^ and heard the neighbors and - relatives of her
30525 ^ that was magnifying [the] lord the mercy of him with her,
30533 ^ and they were rejoicing with her.
30536 ^ and it came to pass on - day the eighth,
30543 ^ they came
30544 ^ to circumcise the child,
30547 ^ and were calling it after the name of the father of him, zechariah.
30557 ^ and
30558 ^ answering, the mother of him said,
30563 ^ no,
30564 ^ but he will be called john.
30567 ^ and they said to her
30571 ^ -, no one is among the relatives of you,
30578 ^ who is called the name by this.
30583 ^ they were making signs then to the father of him, the
30589 ^ what - he might wish to be called him.
30594 ^ and having asked for a writing tablet,
30597 ^ he wrote,
30598 ^ saying,
30599 ^ john is [the] name of him.
30603 ^ and they marveled all.
30606 ^ was opened then the mouth of him immediately,
30612 ^ and the tongue of him,
30616 ^ and he was speaking,
30618 ^ blessing - god.
30621 ^ and came upon all fear,
30626 ^ those dwelling around them;
30629 ^ and in all the hill country - of judea were being talked about all the things, words these.
30641 ^ and laid [them] up
30643 ^ all those having heard, in the heart of them,
30650 ^ saying,
30651 ^ what then the child this will be?
30657 ^ and for [the] hand of [the] lord was with him.
30664 ^ and zechariah, the father of him, was filled with [the] spirit holy,
30672 ^ and prophesied,
30674 ^ saying,
30675 ^ blessed be [the] lord the god - of israel,
30681 ^ because he has visited
30683 ^ and has performed redemption [on] the people of him,
30689 ^ and has raised up a horn of salvation for us, in [the] house of david of [the] servant of him;
30699 ^ as he spoke by [the] mouth of the holy of old prophets of him,
30709 ^ salvation from [the] enemies of us, and from [the] hand
30716 ^ of all those hating us;
30720 ^ to fulfill mercy toward the fathers of us,
30726 ^ and to remember [the] covenant holy of him, [the] oath
30732 ^ that he swore to abraham, the father of us,
30739 ^ - to grant us,
30742 ^ without fear,
30743 ^ from [the] hand of our enemies having been saved, to serve him, in holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.
30759 ^ and you now, child, prophet of [the] most high will be called;
30766 ^ you will go for before the lord,
30770 ^ to prepare ways of him;
30773 ^ - to give knowledge of salvation to people of him, in forgiveness of [the] sins of them, through [the] affections of compassion of god of us,
30789 ^ in which will visit us [the] sunrise from on high,
30796 ^ to shine upon
30797 ^ those in darkness and in [the] shadow of death
30803 ^ sitting;
30804 ^ - to direct the feet of us into [the] way of peace.
30812 ^ - and
30814 ^ the child continued to grow
30816 ^ and was strengthened in spirit;
30819 ^ and he was in the deserted places until [the] day of appearance of him to - israel.
30831 ^ it came to pass then in the days those,
30837 ^ went out a decree from caesar augustus
30842 ^ to register all the world.
30846 ^ this registration first took place [when]
30850 ^ was governing - syria quirinius.
30854 ^ and were going all
30857 ^ to be registered,
30858 ^ each to the of themselves city.
30863 ^ went up then also joseph, from - galilee out of [the] town of nazareth, to - judea, to [the] city of david,
30879 ^ which is called bethlehem,
30882 ^ because of - being his of [the] house and family of david,
30891 ^ to register with mary,
30894 ^ the [one] being betrothed to him,
30897 ^ she being with child.
30899 ^ it came to pass then
30901 ^ in their being - there,
30906 ^ were fulfilled the days
30909 ^ of the giving birth of her.
30912 ^ and she brought forth the son of her, the firstborn,
30919 ^ and wrapped in swaddling cloths him,
30922 ^ and laid him in a manger,
30927 ^ because not there was for them a place in the inn.
30935 ^ and shepherds were in the region - same,
30943 ^ lodging in the fields
30944 ^ and keeping watch - by night over the flock of them.
30953 ^ and an angel of [the] lord stood by them,
30958 ^ and [the] glory of [the] lord shone around them,
30963 ^ and they feared [with] fear great.
30967 ^ and said to them the angel,
30972 ^ not fear;
30974 ^ behold, for
30976 ^ i bring good news to you [of] joy great,
30980 ^ which will be to all the people.
30985 ^ for has been born to you today a savior,
30990 ^ who is christ [the] lord, in [the] city of david.
30997 ^ and this [is] to you the sign:
31002 ^ you will find a baby
31004 ^ wrapped in swaddling cloths,
31005 ^ and lying in a manger.
31009 ^ and suddenly there came with the angel a multitude of [the] host heavenly,
31018 ^ praising - god
31021 ^ and saying:
31023 ^ glory in [the] highest to god,
31027 ^ and on earth peace among men with whom he is pleased!
31034 ^ and it came to pass,
31036 ^ as were departing from them into the heaven the angels,
31045 ^ the shepherds were saying to one another,
31050 ^ let us go through indeed as far as bethlehem,
31054 ^ and let us see the word this
31059 ^ that has come to pass,
31061 ^ which the lord has made known to us.
31066 ^ and they came
31068 ^ having hurried,
31069 ^ and found - both mary and - joseph, and the baby,
31080 ^ lying in the manger.
31531 ^ him to be in their company, they went a day’s journey,
31539 ^ and began seeking him among the relatives and the acquaintances;
31548 ^ and
31549 ^ not having found [him], they returned to jerusalem,
31554 ^ seeking him.
31556 ^ and it came to pass
31558 ^ after days three, they found him
31563 ^ in the temple, sitting in [the] midst of the teachers,
31571 ^ both hearing them
31574 ^ and questioning them.
31577 ^ were amazed then
31579 ^ all those hearing him at the understanding and the answers of him.
31590 ^ and
31591 ^ having seen him, they were astonished,
31594 ^ and said to him the mother of him,
31601 ^ child why have you done to us thus?
31606 ^ behold,
31607 ^ the father of you, and i,
31611 ^ distressing were seeking you.
31614 ^ and he said to them,
31618 ^ why [is it]
31619 ^ that you were seeking me?
31622 ^ not knew you
31624 ^ that
31625 ^ in the [house] of the father of me it behooves to be me?”
31633 ^ and they not understood the word
31639 ^ that he spoke to them.
31642 ^ and he went down with them
31646 ^ and came to nazareth,
31650 ^ and he was
31652 ^ subject to them.
31654 ^ and the mother of him was treasuring up all the [these] matters in the heart of her.
31666 ^ and jesus continued to advance in - wisdom and stature, and in favor with god and men.
31680 ^ in year then
31683 ^ fifteenth of the reign of tiberius caesar,
31688 ^ being governor pontius pilate - of judea,
31693 ^ and being tetrarch - of galilee herod,
31698 ^ philip now
31700 ^ the brother of him being tetrarch - of ituraea and of trachonitis [the] region,
31709 ^ and lysanias - of abilene being tetrarch, during [the] high priesthood of annas and caiaphas, came [the] word of god upon john, - of zechariah son, in the wilderness.
31730 ^ and he went into all the surrounding region of the jordan,
31738 ^ proclaiming a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins,
31744 ^ as it has been written in [the] book of [the] words of isaiah the prophet:
31752 ^ [the] voice
31753 ^ of one crying in the wilderness,
31757 ^ prepare the way of [the] lord;
31761 ^ straight make the paths of him.
31766 ^ every valley will be filled,
31769 ^ and every mountain and hill will be made low;
31775 ^ and will become the crooked into straight,
31781 ^ and the rough into ways smooth;
31787 ^ and will see all flesh the salvation - of god.”
31795 ^ he was saying therefore to the coming out crowds
31800 ^ to be baptized by him,
31803 ^ offspring of vipers, who forewarned you
31808 ^ to flee from
31810 ^ the coming wrath?
31813 ^ produce therefore fruits worthy - of repentance;
31819 ^ and not begin
31822 ^ to say in yourselves,
31825 ^ [as] father we have - abraham.
31829 ^ i say for to you,
31832 ^ that is able - god
31836 ^ from - stones these to raise up children - to abraham.
31844 ^ already now also the ax to the root of the trees is applied;
31855 ^ every therefore
31857 ^ tree
31858 ^ not producing fruit good is cut down
31863 ^ and into [the] fire is thrown.
31867 ^ and were asking him the crowds,
31872 ^ saying,
31873 ^ what then shall we do?
34283 ^ to the [one] striking you on the cheek, offer also the other;
34293 ^ and
34294 ^ from the [one] taking away your - cloak, also the tunic not do withhold.
34305 ^ to everyone asking you, give,
34309 ^ and
34310 ^ from the [one] taking away what [is] yours, not ask [it] back.
34317 ^ and as you desire
34320 ^ that should do to you - men,
34325 ^ do to them likewise.
34328 ^ and if you love
34331 ^ those loving you,
34334 ^ what to you credit is it?
34338 ^ even for - sinners
34342 ^ those loving them, love.
34346 ^ and for if you do good
34350 ^ to those doing good to you,
34353 ^ what to you credit is it?
34357 ^ for even - sinners the same do.
34363 ^ and if you lend [to those]
34366 ^ from whom you expect to receive back,
34370 ^ what to you credit is it?
34374 ^ even sinners to sinners lend,
34378 ^ that they might receive the same amount.
34382 ^ but love the enemies of you,
34387 ^ and do good,
34389 ^ and lend,
34391 ^ nothing expecting in return,
34393 ^ and will be the reward of you great,
34399 ^ and you will be sons of the most high;
34403 ^ for he kind is to the ungrateful and evil.
34412 ^ be you merciful,
34414 ^ as also the father of you merciful is.
34421 ^ and not judge,
34424 ^ that no not you should be judged;
34428 ^ and not condemn,
34431 ^ that no not you should be condemned.
34435 ^ forgive,
34436 ^ and you will be forgiven.
34438 ^ give,
34439 ^ and it will be given to you.
34442 ^ measure good,
34444 ^ pressed down,
34445 ^ shaken together,
34446 ^ running over, will they put into the lap of you,
34452 ^ with that for
34454 ^ measure you measure,
34456 ^ it will be measured again to you.
34458 ^ he spoke then also a parable to them,
34463 ^ not is able a blind [man],
34466 ^ a blind [man] to lead?
34468 ^ not both into a pit will fall?
34473 ^ not is a disciple above the teacher;
35955 ^ what he seems to have will be taken away from him.
35961 ^ came then to him the mother and the brothers of him,
35971 ^ and not they were able
35974 ^ to get to him, because of the crowd.
35979 ^ it was told also him,
35982 ^ the mother of you and the brothers of you are standing outside,
35991 ^ to see wanting you.
35994 ^ - but
35996 ^ answering, he said to them,
36000 ^ mother of me and brothers of me,
36005 ^ those are
36007 ^ who the word - of god
36012 ^ are hearing
36013 ^ and doing.
36015 ^ it came to pass then, on one of the days
36021 ^ also he entered into a boat
36026 ^ with the disciples of him,
36030 ^ and he said to them,
36034 ^ let us pass over to the other side of the lake.
36040 ^ and they launched out.
36042 ^ sailing then of them,
36045 ^ he fell asleep.
36046 ^ and came down a storm of wind on the lake,
36053 ^ and they were being swamped
36055 ^ and were in danger.
36287 ^ that having taken place, they fled
36290 ^ and reported [it] to the city and to the country.
36299 ^ they went out then
36301 ^ to see
36302 ^ that having taken place,
36304 ^ and they came to - jesus
36309 ^ and found
36311 ^ sitting the man
36314 ^ from whom the demons had gone out,
36319 ^ clothed
36320 ^ and being of sound mind, at the feet - of jesus.
36327 ^ and they were afraid.
36329 ^ related then to them
36332 ^ those having seen [it],
36334 ^ how was healed the [one] having been possessed by demons.
36338 ^ and asked him all the multitude of the surrounding region of the gerasenes
36348 ^ to depart from them,
36351 ^ because with fear great they were seized.
36355 ^ he now,
36357 ^ having entered into the boat, turned back.
36361 ^ was begging however him the man
36366 ^ from whom had gone the demons
36371 ^ to be [taken] with him.
36374 ^ he sent away however him
36377 ^ saying,
36378 ^ return to the house of you,
36383 ^ and relate
36385 ^ all that for you has done - god.
36390 ^ and he departed,
36392 ^ through all the city proclaiming
36397 ^ all that had done for him - jesus.
37015 ^ whom me do pronounce the crowds to be?
37021 ^ - and
37023 ^ answering, they said,
37025 ^ john the baptist;
37028 ^ others also,
37030 ^ elijah;
37031 ^ others now,
37033 ^ that a prophet, one of the ancients, has arisen.
37039 ^ he said then to them,
37042 ^ you however,
37044 ^ whom me do pronounce to be?
37048 ^ peter then
37050 ^ answering said,
37052 ^ the christ - of god.
37056 ^ - and
37058 ^ having strictly warned them, he instructed [them]
37061 ^ to no one to tell this,
37064 ^ having said
37065 ^ -, it is necessary for
37067 ^ the son - of man many things to suffer,
37073 ^ and to be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes,
37082 ^ and to be killed,
37084 ^ and on the third day to be raised.
37089 ^ he was saying then to all,
37093 ^ if anyone desires
37096 ^ after me to come,
37099 ^ let him deny himself,
37101 ^ and let him take up the cross of him every day,
37108 ^ and let him follow me.
37253 ^ which he was about to accomplish in jerusalem.
37258 ^ - and
37260 ^ peter and those with him were
37266 ^ heavy with sleep;
39793 ^ the [one] however against the holy spirit having blasphemed, not will be forgiven.
39802 ^ when then they bring you before the synagogues, and the rulers, and the authorities,
39815 ^ not be anxious
39817 ^ how
39818 ^ or what you shall reply in defense,
39821 ^ or what you should say;
39824 ^ the for
39826 ^ holy spirit will teach you in same the hour
40586 ^ the time however this, how not do you know
40593 ^ to discern?
40594 ^ why now even for yourselves not judge you what [is] right?
40603 ^ as for you are going with the adversary of you before a magistrate, in the way
40615 ^ give earnestness
40617 ^ to be set free from him,
40620 ^ lest ever he should drag away you to the judge,
40626 ^ and the judge you will deliver to the officer,
40633 ^ and the officer you will cast into prison.
40640 ^ i say to you,
40642 ^ no not shall you come out from there
40646 ^ until even the last lepton you shall have paid.”
40652 ^ were present now some at the same - time,
40659 ^ telling him about the galileans
40664 ^ of whom the blood pilate had mingled with the sacrifices of them.
40673 ^ and
40674 ^ answering, he said to them,
40677 ^ think you
40678 ^ that - galileans these, sinners beyond all the galileans were,
40688 ^ because such things they have suffered?
40691 ^ no,
40692 ^ i say to you;
40694 ^ but if not you repent,
40698 ^ all likewise you will perish.
40701 ^ or those - ten [and] eight
40705 ^ on whom fell the tower in - siloam
40713 ^ and killed them,
40716 ^ think you
40717 ^ that these debtors were beyond all the men
40725 ^ - dwelling in jerusalem?
40728 ^ no,
40729 ^ i say to you;
40731 ^ but if not you repent,
40735 ^ all likewise you will perish.
40738 ^ he was speaking then this - parable:
40743 ^ a fig tree had a certain [man]
41308 ^ blessed is
41309 ^ the [one] coming in [the] name of [the] lord.’
41314 ^ and it came to pass
41316 ^ on the going of him into a house of one of the rulers of the pharisees on a sabbath
41328 ^ to eat bread,
41330 ^ and they were
41333 ^ watching him.
41335 ^ and behold,
41337 ^ a man certain there was
41340 ^ with dropsy before him.
41343 ^ and
41344 ^ answering, - jesus spoke to the lawyers and to [the] pharisees,
41353 ^ saying,
41354 ^ is it lawful on the sabbath
41357 ^ to heal
41358 ^ or not?
41360 ^ - but they were silent.
41363 ^ and
41364 ^ having taken hold [of him], he healed him
41367 ^ and let [him] go.
41369 ^ and to them he said,
41373 ^ which of you a son or an ox into a pit will fall,
41381 ^ also not immediately he will pull up him on day the sabbath?
41390 ^ and not they were able
41393 ^ to reply to these things.
41396 ^ he was speaking then
41398 ^ to those having been invited a parable,
41402 ^ remarking
41403 ^ how the first places they were choosing out,
41407 ^ saying to them,
41410 ^ when you are invited by anyone to wedding feasts,
41416 ^ not do recline in the first place,
41421 ^ lest ever [one] more honorable than you might have been
41425 ^ invited by him,
41428 ^ and
41429 ^ having come,
41430 ^ the [one] you and him
41434 ^ having invited will say to you,
41437 ^ give to this one [your] place,
41440 ^ and then you should begin
41443 ^ with shame the last place to take.
41449 ^ but when you are invited,
42542 ^ to dig not i am able;
42545 ^ to beg i am ashamed.
42547 ^ i know
42548 ^ what i will do
42550 ^ so that when i shall have been removed from the management,
42556 ^ they might receive me into the homes of them.
42562 ^ and
42563 ^ having called to [him] one each of the debtors of the master of him, he was saying to the first,
42574 ^ how much owe you to master of me?
42579 ^ - and he said,
42582 ^ a hundred baths of oil.
42585 ^ - and he said to him,
42589 ^ take your the bill
42593 ^ and,
42594 ^ having sat down quickly, write fifty.
42598 ^ then to another he said,
42601 ^ you now how much owe?
42605 ^ - and he said,
42608 ^ a hundred cors of wheat.
42611 ^ he says to him,
42613 ^ take your - bill
42617 ^ and write eighty.
42620 ^ and praised the master the manager - unrighteous,
42628 ^ because shrewdly he had acted.
42631 ^ for the sons of the age this more shrewd than the sons of the light in the generation - of themselves are.
42649 ^ and i to you say,
42653 ^ for yourselves make friends by the wealth - of unrighteousness,
42661 ^ that when it fails
42664 ^ they might receive you into the eternal dwellings.
42670 ^ the [one] faithful with very little, also with much faithful is;
42679 ^ and the [one] with very little unrighteous, also with much unrighteous is.
42689 ^ if therefore in the unrighteous wealth, faithful not you have been,
42698 ^ the true [riches] who to you will entrust?
42703 ^ and if in that which [is] of another, faithful not you have been,
42711 ^ that which [is] yours who to you? will give
42716 ^ no servant is able
42719 ^ two masters to serve;
42722 ^ either for the one he will hate,
42727 ^ and the other he will love;
42731 ^ or one he will be devoted to,
42734 ^ and the other he will despise.
42738 ^ not you are able
42740 ^ god to serve
42742 ^ and money.
42744 ^ were listening to now these things all the pharisees,
42750 ^ lovers of money being,
42752 ^ and they were ridiculing him.
42755 ^ and he said to them,
42758 ^ you are
42760 ^ those justifying themselves before - men,
42766 ^ - but
42768 ^ god knows the hearts of you;
42773 ^ for that which among men [is] exalted [is] an abomination before - god.
42782 ^ the law and the prophets [were] until john;
42789 ^ from that time the kingdom - of god is proclaimed,
42796 ^ and everyone into it forces his way.
42801 ^ easier for however it is
42804 ^ the heaven and the earth to pass away,
42810 ^ than
42811 ^ of the law one stroke of a pen to fail.
42816 ^ everyone
42817 ^ - putting away the wife of him
42822 ^ and marrying another commits adultery.
42826 ^ and
42827 ^ the [one]
42828 ^ her put away from a husband
42831 ^ marrying commits adultery.
42833 ^ a man now
42835 ^ certain there was rich,
42838 ^ and he was clothed in purple and fine linen,
42843 ^ making good cheer every day in splendor.
42847 ^ a poor man now
42849 ^ certain named lazarus was laid at the gate of him,
42857 ^ being full of sores
42858 ^ and desiring
42860 ^ to be fed
42861 ^ from that falling from the table of the rich man;
42869 ^ but even the dogs,
42873 ^ coming, were licking the sores of him.
42878 ^ it came to pass that then
42880 ^ died the poor man,
42883 ^ and was carried away he by the angels into the bosom of abraham.
42893 ^ died then also the rich man
42898 ^ and was buried.
42900 ^ and in - hades,
42904 ^ having lifted up the eyes of him,
42908 ^ being in torment, he sees abraham from afar,
42915 ^ and lazarus in the bosom of him.
42921 ^ and he
42923 ^ having cried out said,
42925 ^ father abraham, have mercy on me
42929 ^ and send lazarus,
42932 ^ that he might dip the tip of the finger of him in water
42940 ^ and cool the tongue of me;
42945 ^ for i am suffering in the flame this.
42951 ^ said then abraham,
42954 ^ child, remember
42956 ^ that you did fully receive the [things] good of you in the lifetime of you,
42965 ^ and lazarus likewise the [things] evil.
42970 ^ now however here he is comforted;
42974 ^ you now are suffering.
42977 ^ and besides all these things, between us and you a chasm great has been fixed,
42988 ^ so that
42989 ^ those desiring
42991 ^ to pass from here to you not are able,
42997 ^ nor from there to us can they pass.
43002 ^ he said then,
43004 ^ i implore you then, father,
43008 ^ that you would send him to the house of the father of me —
43017 ^ i have for five brothers —
43021 ^ so that he might warn them,
43024 ^ that not also they might come to the place this - of torment.
43035 ^ says however abraham,
43038 ^ they have moses and the prophets;
43043 ^ let them hear them.
43045 ^ - and he said,
43048 ^ no, father abraham,
43051 ^ but if one from [the] dead should go to them,
43059 ^ they will repent.
43060 ^ he said however to him,
43063 ^ if moses and the prophets not they hear,
43070 ^ not even
43071 ^ if one out from [the] dead should rise, will they be persuaded.
43077 ^ he said then to the disciples of him,
43083 ^ impossible it is
43085 ^ for the stumbling blocks not
43089 ^ to come,
43090 ^ but woe [to him]
43092 ^ by whom they come!
43095 ^ it is better for him
43097 ^ if a stone of a mill is hung around the neck of him
43105 ^ and he is thrown into the sea,
43110 ^ than that he should cause to stumble - little of these one.
43117 ^ take heed to yourselves.
43119 ^ if should sin the brother of you,
43124 ^ rebuke him;
43126 ^ and if he should repent,
43129 ^ forgive him.
43131 ^ and if seven times in the day he should sin against you,
43139 ^ and seven times should return to you,
43144 ^ saying
43145 ^ i repent,
43146 ^ you shall forgive him.
43148 ^ and said the apostles to the lord,
43154 ^ add to us faith!
43157 ^ said then the lord,
43161 ^ if you have faith like a grain of mustard,
43167 ^ you would have said - to the mulberry tree this,
43172 ^ be uprooted
43173 ^ and be planted in the sea,
43178 ^ and it would have obeyed - you.
43182 ^ which now
43184 ^ of you
43186 ^ a servant having,
43188 ^ plowing
43189 ^ or shepherding,
43191 ^ the [one]
43192 ^ having come in out of the field, will say to him,
43246 ^ that which we were bound to do, we have done.
43250 ^ and it came to pass
43252 ^ in the going up to jerusalem
43257 ^ that he was passing through [the] midst of samaria and galilee.
43265 ^ and on entering of him into a certain village,
43271 ^ met him ten leprous men,
43276 ^ who stood afar off.
43279 ^ and they lifted up [their] voice,
43283 ^ saying,
43284 ^ jesus, master, have compassion on us.
43288 ^ and
43289 ^ having seen [them], he said to them,
44291 ^ what to you desire you i shall do?
44295 ^ - and he said,
44298 ^ lord, that i might receive sight.
44301 ^ and - jesus said to him,
44306 ^ receive sight!
44307 ^ the faith of you has healed you.
44312 ^ and immediately he received sight
44315 ^ and began following him,
44318 ^ glorifying - god.
44321 ^ and all the people,
44325 ^ having seen [it], gave praise - to god.
44330 ^ and
44331 ^ having entered, he was passing through - jericho.
44335 ^ and behold,
44337 ^ a man
44338 ^ by name called
44340 ^ zacchaeus,
44341 ^ and he was a chief tax collector,
44345 ^ and he [was] rich.
44348 ^ and he was seeking
44350 ^ to see
44351 ^ - jesus, who he is,
44355 ^ and not he was able because of the crowd,
44361 ^ because - in stature small he was.
44366 ^ and
44367 ^ having run to the front he went up into a sycamore-fig tree,
44374 ^ so that he might see him,
44377 ^ for
44378 ^ that [way] he was about to pass.
44381 ^ and as he came to the place,
44635 ^ which i kept lying away in a piece of cloth.
44640 ^ i was afraid for of you,
44643 ^ because a man harsh you are.
44647 ^ you take up
44648 ^ what not you did lay down,
44651 ^ and you reap
44653 ^ what not you did sow.
44656 ^ he says to him,
44658 ^ out of the mouth of you i will judge you, evil servant.
44666 ^ you knew
44667 ^ that i a man harsh am,
44672 ^ taking up
44673 ^ what not i did lay down
44676 ^ and reaping
44678 ^ what not i did sow?
44681 ^ then because of why not did you give of me the money to [the] bank,
44691 ^ and i
44692 ^ having come, with interest - it might have collected?
44698 ^ and
44699 ^ to those standing by he said,
44702 ^ take from him the mina,
44707 ^ and give [it]
44709 ^ to the [one] the ten minas
44713 ^ having.
44714 ^ and they said to him,
44717 ^ master, he has ten minas.
44721 ^ i say to you
44723 ^ that
44724 ^ to everyone - having will be given;
44908 ^ blessed is the coming - king in [the] name of [the] lord.”
44916 ^ in heaven peace,
44919 ^ and glory in [the] highest.
44923 ^ and some of the pharisees from the crowd said to him,
44933 ^ teacher, rebuke the disciples of you.
44938 ^ and
44939 ^ answering, he said,
44941 ^ i say to you
44943 ^ if these will be silent,
44946 ^ the stones will cry out.
44949 ^ and as he drew near,
45176 ^ having been persuaded for they are,
45179 ^ john a prophet to be.
45182 ^ and they answered,
45184 ^ not they knew from where.
45187 ^ and - jesus said to them,
45192 ^ neither i tell you
45196 ^ by what authority these things i am doing.
45201 ^ he began then
45203 ^ to the people to speak the parable this:
45210 ^ a man certain planted a vineyard,
45214 ^ and rented it to farmers,
45218 ^ and went abroad a time long.
45222 ^ and [in the] season, he sent to the farmers a servant,
45229 ^ that from the fruit of the vineyard they will give to him.
45237 ^ - but
45239 ^ the farmers sent away him,
45242 ^ having beaten [him], empty-handed.
45244 ^ and he proceeded
45246 ^ another to send
45248 ^ a servant;
45249 ^ - but
45251 ^ him having beaten
45253 ^ and having dishonored, they sent away empty-handed.
45257 ^ and he proceeded
45259 ^ a third to send;
45261 ^ - then
45263 ^ also him having wounded, they cast out.
45267 ^ said then the master of the vineyard,
45273 ^ what shall i do?
45275 ^ i will send the son of me, the beloved;
45281 ^ perhaps him they will respect.
45976 ^ bringing [you] before kings and governors on account of the name of me.
45985 ^ it will result to you for a testimony.
45989 ^ settle therefore in the minds of you
45995 ^ not to premeditate
45997 ^ to make a defense;
45998 ^ i for will give you a mouth and wisdom,
46005 ^ which not will be able
46008 ^ to resist
46009 ^ nor to reply to all
46012 ^ those opposing you.
46015 ^ you will be betrayed then even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends,
46026 ^ and they will put to death [some] from among you.
46030 ^ and you will be
46032 ^ hated by all because of the name of me.
46039 ^ but a hair of the head of you no not should perish.
46048 ^ by the patient endurance of you, you will gain the souls of you.
46056 ^ when then you see
46059 ^ being encircled by encampments jerusalem,
46063 ^ then know
46065 ^ that has drawn near the desolation of her.
46070 ^ then those in - judea, let them flee to the mountains;
46079 ^ and those in midst of her, let them depart out;
46085 ^ and those in the countries, not let them enter into her;
46094 ^ for [the] days of avenging these are,
46099 ^ - to fulfill
46101 ^ all things - having been written.
46104 ^ but woe
46105 ^ to those in womb
46108 ^ having,
46109 ^ and to the [ones] nursing in those the days;
46116 ^ there will be for distress great upon the land and wrath to the people this.
46128 ^ and they will fall by [the] edge of [the] sword,
46132 ^ and will be led captive into the nations; all
46138 ^ and jerusalem will be
46141 ^ trodden down by [the] gentiles,
46144 ^ until that are fulfilled [the] times of [the] gentiles.
46149 ^ and there will be signs in sun, and moon, and stars;
46158 ^ and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity, [the] roaring of [the] sea and rolling surge,
46170 ^ fainting men from fear and expectation
46176 ^ of that which is coming on the earth;
46180 ^ - for
46182 ^ the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
46186 ^ and then will they see the son - of man
46193 ^ coming in a cloud, with power and glory great.
46201 ^ beginning then of these things
46204 ^ to come to pass,
46205 ^ look up
46206 ^ and lift up the heads of you,
46211 ^ because draws near the redemption of you.
46216 ^ and he spoke a parable to them:
46220 ^ behold the fig tree and all the trees.
46227 ^ when they sprout already,
46467 ^ where will you we should prepare?
46470 ^ - and he said to them,
46474 ^ behold,
46475 ^ having entered of you into the city,
46480 ^ will meet you a man,
46483 ^ a pitcher of water carrying;
46486 ^ follow him into the house
46491 ^ into which he enters;
46494 ^ and you shall say to the master of the house,
46500 ^ says to you the teacher,
46504 ^ where is the guest room,
46508 ^ where the passover with the disciples of me i may eat?
46516 ^ and he you will show an upper room large,
46521 ^ furnished;
46522 ^ there prepare.
47103 ^ what would be, they said,
47106 ^ lord, if will we strike with [the] sword?
47111 ^ and struck one a certain of them of the high priest the servant,
47121 ^ and cut off the ear, his - right.
48158 ^ that having taken place, he began glorifying - god,
48163 ^ saying,
48164 ^ certainly the man this righteous was.
48170 ^ and all the
48173 ^ having come together crowds
48175 ^ to the spectacle this,
48179 ^ having seen
48180 ^ the things having taken place,
48182 ^ beating the breasts were returning [home].
48186 ^ stood now all those who knew him from afar off,
48194 ^ also women,
48196 ^ those having followed him from - galilee,
48202 ^ beholding these things.
48204 ^ and behold,
48206 ^ a man named joseph,
48209 ^ a council member, being
48211 ^ also a man good and righteous,
48216 ^ he not was
48219 ^ having consented to the counsel and the deed of them, from arimathea, a city of the jews,
48231 ^ who was waiting for the kingdom - of god.
48237 ^ he
48238 ^ having gone - to pilate, asked [for] the body - of jesus.
48246 ^ and
48247 ^ having taken it down, he wrapped it in a linen cloth
48251 ^ and placed it in a tomb cut in a rock,
48257 ^ in which no had been no one not yet
48262 ^ laid.
48263 ^ and [the] day it was
48266 ^ of preparation,
48267 ^ and sabbath was just beginning.
50015 ^ whatever anyhow - he may say to you, do.
50021 ^ there were now
50023 ^ there of stone, water jars six, according to the purification of the jews, standing,
52848 ^ what he was about to do.
52851 ^ answered him - philip,
52855 ^ two hundred denarii worth of loaves not are sufficient for them
52861 ^ that each little [piece] one might receive.
52866 ^ says to him one of the disciples of him, andrew, the brother of simon peter,
52878 ^ is a little boy here,
54409 ^ whom they seek to kill?
54412 ^ and behold,
54414 ^ publicly he speaks,
54416 ^ and nothing to him they say
54420 ^ not ever. truly have recognized the rulers
54425 ^ that this is the christ?
54430 ^ but this [man], we know
54433 ^ from where he is.
54435 ^ the however
54437 ^ christ,
54438 ^ whenever he may come,
54440 ^ no one knows
54442 ^ from where he is.
54444 ^ cried out therefore in the temple
54449 ^ teaching - jesus,
54452 ^ and saying,
54454 ^ me you know,
54456 ^ and you know
54458 ^ from where i am;
54460 ^ and of myself not i have come,
54465 ^ but is true
54468 ^ the [one] having sent me,
54471 ^ whom you not know.
54475 ^ but i know him,
54478 ^ because from him i am,
54482 ^ and he me sent.
54485 ^ they were seeking therefore
54487 ^ him to take,
54489 ^ but no one laid upon him the hand,
54496 ^ because not yet had come the hour of him.
54502 ^ out of the crowd now
54506 ^ many believed in him
54510 ^ and were saying,
54512 ^ the christ,
54514 ^ when he comes,
54516 ^ not more signs will he do
54579 ^ where he is about to go
54583 ^ that we not will find him?
54588 ^ not
54589 ^ to the dispersion among the greeks is he about
54595 ^ to go
54596 ^ and to teach the greeks?
54600 ^ what is the word this
54605 ^ that he said,
54607 ^ you will seek me,
54609 ^ and not will find me,
54613 ^ and where am i
54617 ^ you not are able
54620 ^ to come
54621 ^ in now
54623 ^ the last day, the great [day] of the feast, stood - jesus
54633 ^ and cried out,
54635 ^ saying,
54636 ^ if anyone thirsts,
54639 ^ let him come to me
54642 ^ and drink.
54666 ^ whom were about to receive
54669 ^ those having believed in him;
54673 ^ not yet [given] for was [the] spirit,
54677 ^ because jesus not yet was glorified.
54681 ^ [some] of the crowd therefore,
54685 ^ having heard the words these, were saying
54690 ^ this is truly the prophet.
54695 ^ others were saying,
54697 ^ this is the christ.
54701 ^ others however were saying,
54704 ^ not indeed out of - galilee the christ comes?
54712 ^ not the scripture has said
54716 ^ that out of the seed of david and from bethlehem, the village
54726 ^ where was david, comes the christ?
54732 ^ a division therefore occurred in the crowd because of him.
54740 ^ some now desired
54743 ^ of them
54745 ^ to seize him,
54747 ^ but no one laid on him the hands.
54754 ^ came therefore the officers to the chief priests and pharisees,
54763 ^ and said to them that,
54767 ^ because of why not did you bring him?
54772 ^ answered the officers,
54775 ^ never spoke like this. a man
54779 ^ answered therefore them the pharisees,
54784 ^ not also you have been deceived?
54788 ^ not any of the rulers has believed on him,
54796 ^ or of the pharisees?
54800 ^ but the crowd this,
54804 ^ - not
54806 ^ knowing the law, accursed are.
54811 ^ says nicodemus to them,
54815 ^ the [one] having come to him, the former
54821 ^ one being
54823 ^ of them,
54825 ^ not the law of us does judge the man,
54832 ^ if not it has heard first from him
54838 ^ and known
54840 ^ what he does?
54842 ^ they answered
54843 ^ and said to him,
54846 ^ not also you from - galilee are?
54853 ^ search
54854 ^ and see
54856 ^ that out of - galilee a prophet not is raised.”
54863 ^ and went each to the home of him.
54870 ^ jesus however went to the mount - of olives.
54878 ^ early in the morning then again he came into the temple,
54885 ^ and all the people were coming to him.
54892 ^ and
54893 ^ having sat down, he was teaching them.
54896 ^ bring now the scribes and the pharisees a woman
54904 ^ in adultery having been caught,
54907 ^ and
54908 ^ having set her in [the] midst, they say to him,
54914 ^ teacher, this - woman was caught
54919 ^ in the very act, committing adultery.
54922 ^ in now
54924 ^ the law, us moses commanded
54929 ^ - such to be stoned.
54932 ^ you therefore, what say you?
54936 ^ this now they were saying,
54939 ^ testing him
54941 ^ so that they might have [grounds]
54943 ^ to accuse him.
54945 ^ - but
54947 ^ jesus,
54948 ^ down having stooped, with [his] finger began writing on the ground.
54956 ^ as however they continued
54959 ^ asking him,
54961 ^ having lifted himself up
54962 ^ also, he said to them,
54965 ^ the [one] sinless among you, [the] first at her let him cast. stone
54973 ^ and again
54975 ^ having stooped down, he continued to write on the ground.
55506 ^ that which i have seen with the father, i speak;
55513 ^ also you therefore
55516 ^ what you have heard from the father, you do.
55522 ^ they answered
55523 ^ and said to him,
55526 ^ the father of us abraham is.
55531 ^ says to them - jesus,
55535 ^ if children - of abraham you were,
55540 ^ the works - of abraham you would do;
55545 ^ now however you seek
55548 ^ me to kill,
55550 ^ a man
55551 ^ who the truth to you has spoken,
55556 ^ that i heard from - god.
55561 ^ this abraham not did.
55565 ^ you are doing the works of the father of you.
55572 ^ they said therefore to him,
55575 ^ we of sexual immorality not have been born;
55580 ^ one father we have,
55583 ^ - god.
55585 ^ said to them - jesus,
55589 ^ if - god father of you were,
55595 ^ you would have loved - me,
55598 ^ i for from - god came forth
55604 ^ and am here;
55606 ^ not even for of myself have i come,
55611 ^ but he me sent.
55615 ^ because of why the speech - my not do you understand?
55623 ^ because not you are able
55626 ^ to hear the word - my.
55631 ^ you of the father the devil are,
55638 ^ and
55639 ^ the desires of father of you, you desire to do.
55646 ^ he a murderer was from [the] beginning,
55651 ^ and in the truth not has stood,
55657 ^ because not there is truth in him.
55663 ^ whenever he might speak - falsehood,
55667 ^ from the own he speaks;
55671 ^ for a liar he is,
55674 ^ and the father of it.
55678 ^ i now
55680 ^ because the truth speak,
55684 ^ not you do believe me!
55687 ^ which of you convicts me concerning sin?
55694 ^ if [the] truth i speak,
55697 ^ because of why you not do believe me?
58493 ^ blessed is
58494 ^ the [one] coming in [the] name of [the] lord!”
58499 ^ and the king - of israel!”
58830 ^ by what death he was about to die.
58834 ^ answered then him the crowd,
58839 ^ we have heard from the law
58844 ^ that the christ abides to the age,
58851 ^ and how say you
58855 ^ that it behooves
58857 ^ to be lifted up the son - of man?
58862 ^ who is this - son - of man?
58869 ^ said therefore to them - jesus,
58874 ^ yet a little while the light with you is.
58882 ^ walk
58883 ^ while the light you have,
58887 ^ so that not darkness you might overtake.
58892 ^ and
58893 ^ the [one] walking in the darkness not knows
58900 ^ where he is going.
58902 ^ while the light you have,
58906 ^ believe in the light,
58910 ^ so that sons of light you may become.
58914 ^ these things spoke jesus,
58917 ^ and
58918 ^ having gone away, he was hidden from them.
58922 ^ so many however of him
58925 ^ signs having been done before them,
58929 ^ not they believed in him,
58933 ^ so that the word of isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled
58940 ^ that said:
58942 ^ lord, who has believed the report of us?
58948 ^ and the arm of [the] lord to whom has been revealed?”
58954 ^ because of this, not they were able
58958 ^ to believe,
58959 ^ for again said isaiah:
58963 ^ he has blinded of them the eyes,
58967 ^ and has hardened of them the heart,
58972 ^ that not they should see with the eyes,
58977 ^ and understand with the heart,
58981 ^ and turn,
58983 ^ and i will heal them.”
58986 ^ these things said isaiah
58989 ^ because he saw the glory of him
58994 ^ and spoke concerning him.
58998 ^ nevertheless, indeed even of the rulers many believed in him;
59008 ^ but on account of the pharisees not they were confessing,
59014 ^ so that not put out of the synagogue they might be;
59018 ^ they loved for the glory - of men
59024 ^ more than the glory - of god.
59030 ^ jesus then cried out
59033 ^ and said,
59284 ^ what i do you not know presently;
59291 ^ you will know however after these things.
59295 ^ says to him peter,
59298 ^ no not shall you wash of me the feet to the age.
59307 ^ answered jesus him,
59310 ^ if not i wash you,
59314 ^ not you have part with me.
59319 ^ says to him simon peter,
59323 ^ lord, not the feet of me only,
59329 ^ but also the hands and the head.
59336 ^ says to him - jesus,
59631 ^ what you do, do quickly.
59635 ^ this now no one knew
60110 ^ whom the world not is able to receive,
60116 ^ because not it does see him,
60120 ^ nor know.
60122 ^ but you know him,
60125 ^ for with you he abides,
60129 ^ and in you he will be.
60133 ^ not i will leave you as orphans;
60137 ^ i am coming to you. yet a little while
60142 ^ and the world me no more sees,
60148 ^ you however see me;
60152 ^ because i live,
60155 ^ also you will live.
60158 ^ in that - day will know you
60164 ^ that i [am] in the father of me,
60170 ^ and you in me,
60174 ^ and i in you.
60177 ^ the [one] having the commandments of me
60182 ^ and keeping them,
60185 ^ he is
60187 ^ the [one] loving me;
60535 ^ whatever if you wish, you shall ask,
60539 ^ and it will come to pass to you.
60542 ^ in this is glorified the father of me,
60548 ^ that fruit much you should bear,
60552 ^ and you shall be to me disciples.
60556 ^ as has loved me the father,
60561 ^ i also you have loved.
60564 ^ abide in the love - of me.
60570 ^ if the commandments of me you keep,
60575 ^ you will abide in the love of me,
60580 ^ as i, the commandments the father of me have kept,
60588 ^ and i abide of him in the love.
60594 ^ these things i have spoken to you,
60597 ^ that - joy - my in you may be,
60605 ^ and the joy of you may be full.
60610 ^ this is - commandment - my,
60616 ^ that you love one another
60619 ^ as i loved you.
60622 ^ greater than this love no one has,
60627 ^ that one the life of him should lay down for the friends of him.
60637 ^ you friends of me are
60641 ^ if you do
60643 ^ what i command you.
60647 ^ no longer i call you servants,
60651 ^ for the servant not knows
60656 ^ what is doing his - master.
60661 ^ you however i have called friends,
60665 ^ because all things
60667 ^ that i heard from the father of me, i have made known to you.
60675 ^ not you me chose,
60679 ^ but i chose you,
60683 ^ and appointed you
60686 ^ that you should go
60689 ^ and fruit you should bear,
60692 ^ and the fruit of you should remain;
60697 ^ so that
60698 ^ whatever - you might ask the father in the name of me, he may give you.
60709 ^ these things i command you,
60712 ^ that you love one another.
60715 ^ if the world you hates,
60720 ^ you know
60721 ^ that me before you it has hated.
60726 ^ if of the world you were,
60731 ^ the world - [as] its own would love [you];
60737 ^ because however of the world not you are,
60744 ^ but i chose you out of the world,
60751 ^ on account of this hates you the world.
60757 ^ remember the word
60760 ^ that i said to you:
60764 ^ not is a servant greater than the master of him.
60771 ^ if me they persecuted,
60774 ^ also you they will persecute;
60777 ^ if the word of me they kept,
60782 ^ also - yours they will keep.
60786 ^ but these things all they will do against you on account of the name of me,
60796 ^ because not they have known
60799 ^ the [one] having sent me.
60802 ^ if not i had come
60805 ^ and spoken to them,
60808 ^ sin not they would have had;
60811 ^ now however excuse not they have for the sin of them.
61298 ^ - whatever you may ask, the father in the name of me. he will give you,
61309 ^ until now not you have asked nothing in the name of me.
61318 ^ ask
61319 ^ and you will receive,
61321 ^ that the joy of you may be
61326 ^ full.
61327 ^ these things in allegories i have spoken to you;
61332 ^ is coming an hour
61334 ^ when no more in allegories i will speak to you,
61340 ^ but plainly concerning the father i will report to you. in that - day
61351 ^ in the name of me you will ask,
61356 ^ and not i say to you
61360 ^ that i will implore the father for you.
61367 ^ himself for
61369 ^ the father loves you,
61373 ^ because you me have loved
61377 ^ and have believed
61379 ^ that i from - god came forth.
61385 ^ i came forth from the father
61389 ^ and have come into the world;
61394 ^ again i leave the world
61398 ^ and go to the father.
61403 ^ say the disciples of him,
61407 ^ behold,
61408 ^ now in openness you speak,
61412 ^ and allegory not speak.
61416 ^ now we know
61418 ^ that you know all things,
61421 ^ and not need have
61425 ^ that anyone you should ask.
61429 ^ in this we believe
61432 ^ that from god you came forth.
61436 ^ answered them jesus,
61439 ^ now do you believe?
61441 ^ behold,
61442 ^ is coming an hour,
61444 ^ and has come,
61446 ^ when you will be scattered, each to the own,
61452 ^ and i alone you shall leave;
61455 ^ yet not i am alone,
61459 ^ for the father with me is.
61465 ^ these things i have spoken to you
61468 ^ so that in me peace you may have.
61473 ^ in the world tribulation you have.
61478 ^ but take courage;
61480 ^ i have overcome the world.
61484 ^ these things spoke jesus,
61487 ^ and
61488 ^ having lifted up the eyes of him to - heaven, he said,
61496 ^ father, has come the hour;
61500 ^ glorify your - son,
61504 ^ that the son may glorify you.
61509 ^ as you gave him authority over all flesh,
61515 ^ so that all
61517 ^ whom you have given him,
61520 ^ he may give to them life eternal.
61524 ^ this now is - eternal life,
61530 ^ that they may know you, the only true god, and
61538 ^ whom you have sent, jesus christ.
61542 ^ i you glorified on the earth,
61548 ^ the work having completed
61551 ^ that you have given me
61554 ^ that i should do.
61556 ^ and now glorify me you, father, with yourself, with the glory
61566 ^ that i had
61568 ^ before - the world
61572 ^ existed, with you.
61575 ^ i revealed your - name to the men
61581 ^ whom you have given me out of the world.
61587 ^ yours they were,
61589 ^ and to me them you gave,
61592 ^ and the word of you they have kept.
61597 ^ now they have known
61599 ^ that all things
61601 ^ whatever you have given me, of you are;
61607 ^ for the words
61610 ^ that you have given me, i have given them,
61615 ^ and they received [them]
61618 ^ and knew truly
61621 ^ that from you i came forth;
61625 ^ and they believed
61627 ^ that you me sent.
61631 ^ i concerning them am praying.
61635 ^ not concerning the world do i pray,
61640 ^ but
61641 ^ concerning those whom you have given me,
61645 ^ for yours they are.
61648 ^ and things of mine all, yours are;
61654 ^ and - yours, mine;
61658 ^ and i have been glorified in them.
61662 ^ and no longer i am in the world,
61668 ^ and yet themselves in the world they are,
61674 ^ and i to you am coming.
61678 ^ father holy, keep them in the name of you,
61686 ^ which you have given me,
61689 ^ that they may be one
61692 ^ as we [are].
61694 ^ when i was with them,
61698 ^ i was keeping them in the name of you,
61705 ^ which you have given me.
61708 ^ and i guarded [them],
61710 ^ and none of them has perished,
61715 ^ if not the son - of destruction,
61721 ^ that the scripture might be fulfilled.
61725 ^ now however to you i am coming;
61730 ^ and these things i speak in the world,
61736 ^ so that they may have - joy - my
61742 ^ fulfilled within them.
61745 ^ i have given them the word of you,
61751 ^ and the world hated them,
61756 ^ because not they are of the world,
61762 ^ even as i not am of the world.
61769 ^ not i do ask
61771 ^ that you should take them out of the world,
61777 ^ but that you should keep them from - evil.
61784 ^ of the world not they are,
61789 ^ as i not am of the world.
61796 ^ sanctify them by the truth;
61801 ^ the word - of you truth is.
61807 ^ as me you sent into the world,
61813 ^ i also sent them into the world;
61819 ^ and for them i sanctify myself,
61825 ^ that may be also they
61829 ^ sanctified in truth.
61832 ^ not for these however do i ask only,
61838 ^ but also
61840 ^ for those believing through the word of them in me,
61849 ^ that all one may be,
61853 ^ as you, father, [are] in me,
61858 ^ and i in you,
61861 ^ that also they in us may be,
61867 ^ that the world may believe
61871 ^ that you me sent.
61875 ^ and i
61876 ^ the glory
61878 ^ which you have given me, have given them,
61883 ^ so that they may be one,
61886 ^ as we [are] one —
61889 ^ i in them,
61892 ^ and you in me —
61896 ^ that they may be
61898 ^ perfected in unity,
61901 ^ so that may know the world
61905 ^ that you me sent
61909 ^ and loved them
61912 ^ even as me you loved.
61915 ^ father,
61916 ^ [those] whom you have given me, i desire
61920 ^ that where am i,
61924 ^ they also may be with me,
61928 ^ that they may behold - glory - my,
61934 ^ that you gave me
61937 ^ because you loved me before [the] foundation of [the] world. father righteous,
61945 ^ although the world you not has known,
61951 ^ i now you have known,
61955 ^ and these have known
61958 ^ that you me sent.
61962 ^ and i made known to them the name of you,
61968 ^ and will make [it] known,
61970 ^ so that the love
61973 ^ with which you loved me in them may be,
61979 ^ and i in them.
62574 ^ what death he was about to die.
62578 ^ entered therefore again into the praetorium - pilate,
62586 ^ and he called - jesus
62590 ^ and said to him,
62593 ^ you are the king of the jews?
62599 ^ answered jesus,
62601 ^ of yourself you this say,
62606 ^ or others did say [it] to you concerning me?
62612 ^ answered - pilate,
62615 ^ not i a jew am?
62619 ^ the nation - of you and the chief priests delivered you to me.
62629 ^ what have you done?
62631 ^ answered jesus,
62633 ^ the kingdom - my not is of the world this;
62643 ^ if of the world this were - kingdom - my,
62653 ^ - attendants - my would fight -
62659 ^ that not i might be betrayed to the jews.
62664 ^ now however - kingdom - my not is from here.
62673 ^ said therefore to him - pilate,
62678 ^ then a king are you?
62682 ^ answered - jesus,
62685 ^ you say
62687 ^ that a king i am. i
62691 ^ for this have been born,
62694 ^ and for this i have come into the world,

63182 ^ soldiers,
63183 ^ when they crucified - jesus,
63187 ^ took the garments of him
63191 ^ and made four parts,
63195 ^ to each soldier a part,
63198 ^ and also the tunic.
63201 ^ was now the tunic seamless, from the top woven
63210 ^ throughout all.
63212 ^ they said therefore to one another,
63216 ^ not let us tear up it,
63219 ^ but let us cast lots for it,
63223 ^ whose it will be,
63225 ^ that the scripture might be fulfilled
63494 ^ concealed however through the fear of the jews —
63501 ^ that he might take away the body - of jesus;
63507 ^ and gave permission - pilate.
63511 ^ he came therefore
63513 ^ and took away the body of him.
63518 ^ came now also nicodemus,
63522 ^ the [one] having come to him by night at the first,
63529 ^ bearing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about litras a hundred.
63537 ^ they took therefore the body - of jesus
63543 ^ and bound it in linen cloths, with the spices,
63550 ^ as [the] custom is among the jews
63570 ^ in which not yet no one was laid.
63576 ^ there therefore, on account of the preparation of the jews,
63583 ^ because near was the tomb, they laid - jesus.
63591 ^ - now
63593 ^ the first [day] of the week, mary - magdalene comes early,
63601 ^ dark still it being, to the tomb,
63607 ^ and she sees the stone
63611 ^ having been removed from the tomb.
63615 ^ she runs therefore
63617 ^ and comes to simon peter and to the other disciple,
63627 ^ whom loved - jesus,
63631 ^ and she says to them,
63634 ^ they have taken away the lord out of the tomb,
63640 ^ and not we know
63643 ^ where they have laid him.
63646 ^ went forth therefore - peter and the other disciple,
63654 ^ and were coming to the tomb.
63659 ^ were running now the two together,
63664 ^ and the other disciple ran ahead faster - than peter
63672 ^ and came first to the tomb.
63678 ^ and
63679 ^ having stooped down, he sees
63681 ^ lying [there] the linen cloths;
63684 ^ not however he entered.
63687 ^ comes then also simon peter
63692 ^ following him,
63694 ^ and he entered into the tomb
63699 ^ and sees the linen cloths
63703 ^ lying [there], and the soudarion,
63707 ^ which was upon the head of him,
63713 ^ not
63714 ^ with the linen cloths lying,
63718 ^ but
63719 ^ by itself having been folded up in a place.
63724 ^ then therefore entered also the other disciple,
63731 ^ - having come first to the tomb,
63737 ^ and he saw
63739 ^ and believed;
63741 ^ not yet for understood they the scripture
63746 ^ that it behooves
63748 ^ him out from [the] dead to rise.
63752 ^ went away therefore again to their [homes] the disciples.
63759 ^ mary however stood at the tomb outside
63766 ^ weeping.
63767 ^ as therefore she was weeping,
63770 ^ she stooped down into the tomb,
63774 ^ and she sees two angels in white
63780 ^ sitting, one at the head and one at the feet,
63790 ^ where had lain the body - of jesus.
63796 ^ and say to her they,
63800 ^ woman, why weep you?
63803 ^ she says to them,
63805 ^ because they have taken away the lord of me,
63810 ^ and not i know
63813 ^ where they have laid him.
64991 ^ where they were staying, - both peter and john, and james and andrew, philip and thomas, bartholomew and matthew, james [son] of alphaeus, and simon the zealot, and judas [son] of james.
65018 ^ these all were
65021 ^ steadfastly continuing with one accord - in prayer, with [the] women, and mary the mother - of jesus, and the brothers of him.
65037 ^ and in the days these,
65042 ^ having stood up peter in [the] midst of the brothers, he said —
65049 ^ was then [the] number of names together the same about a hundred twenty —
65059 ^ men, brothers, it was necessary for
65062 ^ to have been fulfilled the scripture
65065 ^ which spoke beforehand the spirit - holy by [the] mouth of david concerning judas,
65076 ^ the [one] having become guide
65079 ^ to those having arrested jesus;
65082 ^ for
65083 ^ numbered he was with us,
65087 ^ and was allotted - a share of the ministry this.
65094 ^ this [man] indeed then acquired a field out of [the] reward - of unrighteousness,
65103 ^ and
65104 ^ headlong having fallen, he burst open in [the] middle,
65108 ^ and gushed out all the intestines of him.
65114 ^ and known it became
65117 ^ to all those dwelling in jerusalem,
65121 ^ so that was called the field that in the own language of them akeldama,
65131 ^ that is, field of blood.
65135 ^ it has been written for in [the] book of psalms:
65140 ^ let become the homestead of him desolate,
65145 ^ and not let there be
65148 ^ [one person] dwelling in it,’
65152 ^ and, the position of him let take another.’
65158 ^ it behooves therefore
65160 ^ the having accompanied us men, during all [the] time
65167 ^ that came in and went out among us the lord jesus,
65176 ^ having begun from the baptism of john until the day
65184 ^ in which he was taken up from us,
65188 ^ a witness of the resurrection of him with us to become one of these.
65197 ^ and they put forward two, joseph
65201 ^ - called barsabbas,
65204 ^ who was called justus, and matthias.
65209 ^ and
65210 ^ having prayed, they said,
65212 ^ you lord, knower of the hearts of all, show which you have chosen of these - two, one
65224 ^ to take the place of the ministry this and apostleship,
65232 ^ from which turned aside judas
65236 ^ to go to the place - own.
65242 ^ and they gave lots for them,
65246 ^ and fell the lot on matthias,
65252 ^ and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
65258 ^ and
65259 ^ during the arriving of the day - of pentecost, they were all together in the one [place].
65272 ^ and came suddenly out of - heaven a sound,
65279 ^ like [the] rushing of a wind violent,
65283 ^ and it filled all the house
65288 ^ where they were sitting.
65291 ^ and there appeared to them
65294 ^ dividing tongues as of fire
65298 ^ and sat upon one each of them.
65304 ^ and they were filled with all spirit holy,
65309 ^ and began
65311 ^ to speak in other tongues
65314 ^ as the spirit was giving
65318 ^ to utter forth to them.
65320 ^ were now
65322 ^ in jerusalem dwelling jews, men devout from every nation of those under - heaven.
65335 ^ having come about now the sound of this,
65340 ^ came together the multitude
65343 ^ and was confounded,
65345 ^ because was hearing one each
65349 ^ the own language speaking them.
65354 ^ they were amazed then
65356 ^ and were marveling,
65358 ^ saying,
65359 ^ not
65360 ^ behold
65361 ^ all these are who are speaking galileans?
65367 ^ and how we hear
65371 ^ each the own language of us,
65376 ^ in which we were born?
65379 ^ parthians, and medes, and elamites;
65384 ^ and those inhabiting - mesopotamia, judea also, and cappadocia, pontus and - asia; phrygia both and pamphylia, egypt and the parts - of libya that [are] around cyrene, and those
65412 ^ visiting [here] from rome; jews both and converts, cretans and arabs —
65421 ^ we hear speaking them - [in] our own tongues the great things - of god!
65431 ^ were amazed then all
65434 ^ and were perplexed,
65436 ^ other to other
65439 ^ saying,
65440 ^ what wishes this to be?
65444 ^ others however
65446 ^ mocking were saying
65448 ^ -,
65449 ^ of new wine full they are.
66873 ^ to all those inhabiting jerusalem [is] evident,
66878 ^ and not we are able
66881 ^ to deny [it].
66882 ^ but that not on further it might spread among the people,
66891 ^ let us warn them
66893 ^ no longer to speak in the name this to no man.
66901 ^ and
66902 ^ having called them, they commanded [them]
66905 ^ - at all not to speak
66909 ^ nor to teach in the name - of jesus.
66916 ^ - but
66918 ^ peter and john
66921 ^ answering, said to them,
66925 ^ whether right it is before - god
66931 ^ to you to listen, rather than - god,
66937 ^ you must judge;
66938 ^ not are able for we,
66942 ^ what we have seen
66944 ^ and heard, not to speak.
66948 ^ - and
66950 ^ having further threatened [them], they let go them,
66953 ^ nothing finding
66955 ^ the how
66957 ^ they might punish them, on account of the people,
66962 ^ because all were glorifying - god
66967 ^ for that having happened;
66970 ^ years [old] for was
66973 ^ more than forty, the man
66977 ^ on whom had taken place the sign this of healing.
67911 ^ what you are about to do.
67914 ^ before for
67916 ^ these - days rose up theudas,
67921 ^ affirming
67922 ^ to be somebody himself,
67925 ^ to whom were joined of men number
67929 ^ about four hundred,
67931 ^ who was put to death,
67933 ^ and all,
67935 ^ as many as were persuaded by him, were dispersed,
67939 ^ and it came to nothing.
67943 ^ after this man rose up judas the galilean in the days of the registration
67954 ^ and drew away people after him.
67959 ^ and he perished,
67961 ^ and all
67963 ^ as many as were persuaded by him, were scattered.
67967 ^ and - now i say to you,
67972 ^ withdraw from the men these,
67977 ^ and let alone them,
67980 ^ for if be from men, the plan this or the work this,
67992 ^ it will be overthrown;
67993 ^ if however from god it is,
67998 ^ not you will be able
68000 ^ to overthrow them,
68002 ^ lest ever also fighting against god you would be found.
68006 ^ they were persuaded now by him;
68009 ^ and
68010 ^ having called in the apostles,
68013 ^ having beaten, they commanded [them]
68015 ^ not to speak in the name - of jesus,
68022 ^ and released [them].
68024 ^ they indeed therefore departed,
68028 ^ rejoicing, from [the] presence of the council,
68033 ^ that they had been counted worthy
68035 ^ for the name to suffer dishonor.
68039 ^ every then
68041 ^ day, in the temple and in house, not they ceased
68050 ^ teaching
68051 ^ and proclaiming the good news that the christ [is] jesus.
68056 ^ in now
68058 ^ the days these, [as] are multiplying the disciples,
68064 ^ there arose a grumbling of the hellenists against the hebrews,
68071 ^ because were being overlooked in the distribution - daily the widows of them.
69065 ^ to whom not were willing obedient to be the fathers of us,
69073 ^ but thrust away,
69075 ^ and turned back in the hearts of them to egypt,
69083 ^ having said - to aaron,
69086 ^ make us gods
69089 ^ who will go before us.
69092 ^ - as for
69094 ^ moses this,
69096 ^ who brought out us from [the] land of egypt,
69102 ^ not we know
69104 ^ what has happened to him.’
69107 ^ and they made a calf in the days those
69113 ^ and offered a sacrifice to the idol,
69118 ^ and they were rejoicing in the works of the hands of them.
69126 ^ turned away however - god
69130 ^ and delivered them
69133 ^ to worship the host of heaven,
69138 ^ as it has been written in [the] book of the prophets:
69144 ^ not slain beasts and sacrifices did you offer to me, years forty in the wilderness, o house of israel?
69157 ^ and you took up the tabernacle - of moloch, and the star of the god of you rephan, the images
69172 ^ that you made
69174 ^ to worship them;
69176 ^ and i will remove you beyond babylon.’
69181 ^ the tabernacle of the testimony was with fathers of us in the wilderness,
69192 ^ just as had commanded
69194 ^ the [one] speaking - to moses,
69198 ^ to make it according to the pattern
69203 ^ that he had seen,
69205 ^ which also brought [it], having received by succession, the fathers of us, with joshua in the taking possession of the nations
69219 ^ whom drove out - god from [the] face of the fathers of us, until the days of david,
69232 ^ who found favor before - god
69238 ^ and asked
69240 ^ to find a dwelling place for the house of jacob.
69245 ^ solomon however built him [the] house.
69250 ^ yet not the most high in hand-made [houses] dwells.
69257 ^ as the prophet says:
69261 ^ - heaven [is] to me a throne,
69265 ^ - and
69267 ^ the earth a footstool of the feet of me.
69272 ^ what kind of house will you build me,
69276 ^ says [the] lord,
69278 ^ or what [is] [the] place of the rest of me?
69284 ^ not the hand of me has made these things all?’
69291 ^ stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and - ears, you always the spirit - holy resist;
69305 ^ as the fathers of you,
69309 ^ also you.
69311 ^ which of the prophets not did persecute the fathers of you?
69319 ^ and they killed
69321 ^ those having foretold about the coming of the righteous one,
69328 ^ of whom now you
69331 ^ betrayers and murderers have become,
69335 ^ who received the law by [the] ordination of angels,
69342 ^ and not have kept [it].
70188 ^ having bound, he might bring [them] to jerusalem.
71164 ^ what - god has cleansed, you not call common.
71171 ^ this now took place for three times,
71176 ^ and immediately was taken up the vessel into - heaven.
71184 ^ while then in himself was perplexed - peter
71191 ^ what - might be the vision
71196 ^ that he had seen,
71198 ^ behold,
71199 ^ the men
71201 ^ - having been sent from - cornelius,
71206 ^ having inquired for the house - of simon, stood at the gate.
71215 ^ and
71216 ^ having called out, they were asking
71218 ^ if simon
71220 ^ who [is] called peter here is lodged.
71225 ^ - and
71227 ^ of peter thinking over the vision,
71232 ^ said to him the spirit,
71236 ^ behold,
71237 ^ men three
71239 ^ are seeking you.
71241 ^ but
71242 ^ having risen, go down
71244 ^ and proceed with them,
71248 ^ nothing doubting,
71250 ^ because i have sent them.
71909 ^ what - god has cleansed, you not do call unholy.
71916 ^ this now happened on three times,
71921 ^ and was drawn up again all into - heaven.
71928 ^ and behold,
71930 ^ immediately three men stood at the house
71937 ^ in which i was,
71940 ^ having been sent from caesarea to me.
71945 ^ told now the spirit me
71950 ^ to go with them,
71952 ^ not having discriminated.
71954 ^ went now with me also - six brothers these,
71963 ^ and we entered into the house of the man.
71970 ^ he related then to us
71973 ^ how he had seen the angel
71977 ^ in the house of him, having stood
71982 ^ and having said,
71984 ^ send forth to joppa,
71987 ^ and send for simon,
71990 ^ who is called peter,
71993 ^ who will speak words to you,
71998 ^ in which will be saved you
72002 ^ and all the household of you.
73020 ^ that having happened, he believed,
73023 ^ being astonished at the teaching of the lord.
73257 ^ whom me do you suppose to be?
73261 ^ not am i [he],
73264 ^ but behold,
73266 ^ he comes after me,
74932 ^ this one wanted - paul with him to go forth,
74939 ^ and
74940 ^ having taken, he circumcised him on account of the jews
74946 ^ - being in the parts those;
74952 ^ they knew for all
74955 ^ that a greek the father of him was.
74961 ^ while then they were passing through the cities,
74966 ^ they were delivering to them
74968 ^ to keep the decrees
74971 ^ - decided on by the apostles and elders who [were] in jerusalem.
74981 ^ the indeed therefore
74984 ^ churches were strengthened in the faith,
74988 ^ and were increasing - in number every day.
74994 ^ having passed through then - phrygia and the galatian region,
75001 ^ having been forbidden by the holy spirit
75006 ^ to speak the word in - asia,
75121 ^ where was customary [a place of] prayer to be.
75125 ^ and
75126 ^ having sat down, we began speaking to the
75129 ^ having gathered women.
75131 ^ and a certain woman named lydia, a seller of purple of [the] city of thyatira,
75139 ^ worshiping - god, was listening,
75143 ^ of whom the lord opened
75147 ^ the heart
75149 ^ to attend
75150 ^ to the things being spoken by - paul.
75155 ^ when then she was baptized,
75158 ^ and the house of her,
75162 ^ she begged,
75163 ^ saying,
75164 ^ if you have judged me
75167 ^ faithful to the lord to be,
75761 ^ king another proclaiming to be: jesus.
75766 ^ they stirred up then the crowd, and the city authorities,
75773 ^ hearing these things.
75775 ^ and
75776 ^ having taken - security from - jason and the rest, they let go them.
75787 ^ - and
75789 ^ the brothers immediately by night sent away - both paul and - silas to berea,
75802 ^ who
75803 ^ having arrived, into the synagogue of the jews went.
75810 ^ these now were more noble than those in thessalonica,
75817 ^ who received the word with all readiness,
75824 ^ every day examining the scriptures
75829 ^ if were these things so.
75833 ^ many indeed therefore
75836 ^ of them believed,
75839 ^ and of the grecian women - prominent and men not a few.
75849 ^ when however knew those from - thessalonica jews
75857 ^ that also in - berea was proclaimed by - paul the word - of god,
75870 ^ they came there also,
75872 ^ stirring up
75873 ^ and agitating the crowds.
75877 ^ immediately also then, - paul sent away the brothers
75885 ^ to go as to the sea;
75890 ^ remained but - both silas and - timothy there.
75976 ^ what - may desire of the babbler this to say?
75983 ^ others however,
75985 ^ of foreign gods he seems a proclaimer to be,
75990 ^ because - jesus and the resurrection he was proclaiming the gospel of.
76028 ^ what wish these things to be.
76032 ^ [the] athenians now
76034 ^ all, and the
76037 ^ visiting strangers, in nothing else spent their time
76043 ^ than to tell something
76046 ^ and to hear something new.
76233 ^ in which he is about to judge the world in righteousness, by a man
76243 ^ whom he appointed,
76245 ^ a guarantee having provided to all,
76248 ^ having raised him out from [the] dead.
76578 ^ a judge i of these things not resolve
76583 ^ to be.
76584 ^ and he drove them from the judgment seat.
77483 ^ necessary it is
77485 ^ for you
77486 ^ calm to be,
77488 ^ and nothing rash to do.
77492 ^ you brought for the men these, neither temple plunderers
77499 ^ nor blaspheming the goddess of us.
77504 ^ if indeed therefore demetrius and the with him craftsmen have against anyone a matter,
77517 ^ courts are conducted,
77519 ^ and proconsuls there are;
77522 ^ let them accuse one another.
77524 ^ if however anything beyond this you inquire,
77529 ^ in the lawful assembly it will be solved.
77534 ^ and for we are in danger of
77537 ^ being accused of insurrection in regard to - this day,
77542 ^ not one cause there existing
77545 ^ concerning which not we will be able
77549 ^ to give a reason for the commotion this.
77555 ^ and
77556 ^ these things having said, he dismissed the assembly.
77697 ^ where we were assembled.
77700 ^ was sitting then a certain young man named eutychus by the window,
77709 ^ overpowered by sleep deep
77712 ^ as talked - paul on longer;
77782 ^ there being about to take in - paul.
77787 ^ thus for having arranged, he was
77791 ^ readying himself
77793 ^ to go on foot.
77794 ^ when now he met with us at - assos,
77950 ^ what in it
77953 ^ will happen to me not knowing,
77957 ^ except that the spirit - holy in every city fully testifies to me,
77967 ^ saying
77968 ^ that chains and tribulations me await.
77974 ^ but not any account i make my life
77980 ^ dear to myself,
77982 ^ so as to finish the course of me, and the ministry
77990 ^ that i received from the lord jesus,
77996 ^ to testify fully the gospel of the grace - of god.
78003 ^ and now, behold,
78006 ^ i know
78008 ^ that no more you will see the face of me, you all
78016 ^ among whom i have gone about
78019 ^ proclaiming the kingdom.
78022 ^ therefore i testify to you in - this day,
78029 ^ that innocent i [am] of the blood of all;
78036 ^ not for i shrunk back
78039 ^ - not
78041 ^ from declaring all the counsel - of god to you.
78048 ^ take heed to yourselves and to all the flock
78054 ^ among which you the spirit - holy has set overseers,
78063 ^ to shepherd the church - of god,
78068 ^ which he purchased with - blood the own.
78075 ^ i know
78077 ^ that will come in after the departure of me wolves grievous among you,
78087 ^ not sparing the flock,
78091 ^ and out from your own selves will rise up men
78097 ^ speaking
78098 ^ perverse things,
78099 ^ - to draw away - disciples after them.
78105 ^ therefore stay awake,
78107 ^ remembering
78108 ^ that three years, night and day, not i ceased
78115 ^ with tears admonishing one each.
78120 ^ and - now i commit you to god and to the word of the grace of him,
78133 ^ - being able
78135 ^ to build up
78136 ^ and to give you an inheritance
78140 ^ among those having been sanctified all.
78144 ^ silver or gold or clothing of no one i coveted.
78151 ^ you yourselves know
78153 ^ that the needs of me
78157 ^ and to those being with me, ministered to the hands these.
78166 ^ in everything i showed you
78169 ^ that
78944 ^ to be brought into the barracks, - paul says to the commander,
78953 ^ if is it permitted to me
78956 ^ to say something to you?
78960 ^ - then he was saying,
78963 ^ greek do you know?
78965 ^ not then you are the egyptian
78971 ^ - before these the days
78976 ^ having led a revolt
78977 ^ and having led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the assassins?
78987 ^ said however - paul,
78991 ^ i a man indeed am
78995 ^ a jew of tarsus, - of cilicia, not [of an] insignificant city a citizen.
79003 ^ i implore now you,
79006 ^ allow me
79008 ^ to speak to the people.
79012 ^ having allowed [him] then he,
79015 ^ - paul,
79017 ^ having stood on the stairs, made a sign with the hand to the people;
79026 ^ great then
79028 ^ silence having taken place,
79030 ^ he spoke to [them] in the hebrew language,
79034 ^ saying:
79035 ^ men, brothers, and fathers, hear of me the to you now defense.
79046 ^ having heard then
79048 ^ that in the hebrew language he was addressing them, even more they became quiet.
79057 ^ and he says,
79059 ^ i am a man, a jew,
79063 ^ born in tarsus - of cilicia,
79068 ^ brought up now in the city this
79074 ^ at the feet of gamaliel, having been instructed according to [the] exactness of the of our fathers law,
79084 ^ a zealous one being
79086 ^ - for god,
79088 ^ even as all you are this day;
79093 ^ who this - way persecuted as far as death,
79100 ^ binding
79101 ^ and betraying to prisons men both and women,
79109 ^ as also the high priest bears witness to me,
79115 ^ and all the elderhood;
79119 ^ from whom also
79122 ^ letters, having received to the brothers, to damascus i was on my way
79130 ^ to bring also
79132 ^ those there
79134 ^ being,
79135 ^ bound to jerusalem,
79138 ^ in order that they might be punished.
79140 ^ it happened however to me
79143 ^ journeying
79144 ^ and drawing near - to damascus, about noon,
79150 ^ suddenly out of - heaven shone a light great around me.
79159 ^ i fell then to the ground
79164 ^ and heard a voice
79167 ^ saying to me,
79169 ^ saul, saul, why me persecute you?
79174 ^ i then answered,
79177 ^ who are you, lord?
79180 ^ he said then to me,
79184 ^ i am jesus of nazareth,
79189 ^ whom you are persecuting.
79507 ^ what are you going to do?
79510 ^ the for
79512 ^ man this a roman is.
79642 ^ to strike you is about - god, wall
79648 ^ whitewashed!
79649 ^ and you, do you sit
79652 ^ judging me according to the law,
79657 ^ and
79658 ^ violating law, command
79660 ^ me to be struck?
79991 ^ that you have to report to me?
79995 ^ he said then
79997 ^ -, the jews have agreed
80001 ^ - to ask you
80004 ^ that tomorrow - paul you might bring down into the council,
80012 ^ as being about
80014 ^ something more earnestly to inquire about him.
80019 ^ you therefore not should be persuaded by them.
80024 ^ lie in wait indeed for him of them men more than forty,
80032 ^ who have put under an oath themselves
80035 ^ neither to eat
80037 ^ nor to drink
80039 ^ until that they have killed him;
80043 ^ and now they are ready,
80047 ^ awaiting the from you promise.
80052 ^ - indeed therefore
80055 ^ the commander dismissed the young man,
80059 ^ having instructed [him],
80060 ^ no one tell
80062 ^ that these things you have reported to me.
80067 ^ and
80068 ^ having called to [him] two certain of the centurions, he said,
80074 ^ prepare soldiers two hundred,
80077 ^ so that they might go as far as caesarea,
80081 ^ and horsemen seventy, and spearmen two hundred, for the third hour of the night.
80092 ^ mounts then provide,
80095 ^ so that
80096 ^ having set upon [them] - paul, they might bring [him] safely to felix the governor,
80140 ^ to know the charge
80143 ^ on account of which they were accusing him, i brought [him] down to the council of them,
80152 ^ whom i found
80154 ^ being accused concerning questions of the law of them,
80160 ^ no however
80162 ^ worthy of death or of chains having
80167 ^ accusation.
80168 ^ it having been disclosed then to me of a plot that
80172 ^ against the man would be,
80176 ^ at once i sent [him] to you,
80180 ^ having instructed also the accusers
80184 ^ to speak these things against him before you.
80190 ^ - indeed therefore
80193 ^ the soldiers,
80194 ^ according to that having been ordered them,
80198 ^ having taken - paul, brought [him] by night to - antipatris.
80207 ^ on the now
80209 ^ next day,
80210 ^ having allowed the horsemen
80213 ^ to go with him, they returned to the barracks,
80220 ^ who
80221 ^ having entered into - caesarea
80225 ^ and having delivered the letter to the governor, presented also - paul to him.
80236 ^ having read [it] then,
80238 ^ and having asked
80240 ^ from what province he is,
80244 ^ and having learned
80246 ^ that from cilicia [he is],
80249 ^ i will hear fully you, he was saying,
80252 ^ when also the accusers of you may have arrived,
80258 ^ having commanded
80259 ^ in the praetorium - of herod to be guarded him.
80266 ^ after then
80268 ^ five days, came down the high priest ananias, with elders some and an orator tertullus certain,
80281 ^ who made a representation to the governor against - paul.
80288 ^ having been called then of him,
80291 ^ began
80292 ^ to accuse - tertullus,
80295 ^ saying,
80296 ^ great peace we are attaining through you,
80301 ^ and excellent measures are being done to the nation this through - your foresight, in every way both and everywhere, we gladly accept [it], most excellent felix, with all thankfulness.
80321 ^ in order that however not to any longer you i should be a hindrance,
80328 ^ i implore
80329 ^ to hear you us briefly, [in] your kindness.
80336 ^ having found for the man this a pest,
80342 ^ and stirring insurrection among all the jews - in the world, a leader then of the of the nazarenes sect,
80358 ^ who even
80360 ^ the temple attempted to profane,
80364 ^ whom also we seized.
80367 ^ from him you will be able yourself,
80618 ^ having commanded the centurion
80621 ^ to keep him,
80623 ^ to [let him] have then ease,
80626 ^ and not to forbid
80629 ^ the own of him
80632 ^ to minister to him.
80634 ^ after then
80636 ^ days some,
80638 ^ having arrived - felix with drusilla, the own wife,
80646 ^ being a jewess, he sent for - paul
80651 ^ and heard him concerning the in christ jesus faith.
80660 ^ reasoning then he concerning righteousness and self-control and the judgment
80670 ^ - coming,
80714 ^ favor to acquire for himself with the jews, - felix left - paul
80723 ^ imprisoned.
80724 ^ festus therefore
80726 ^ having arrived in the province, after three days he went up to jerusalem from caesarea.
80737 ^ made a presentation before then him the chief priests and the chiefs of the jews, against - paul,
80750 ^ and they were begging him,
80753 ^ asking a favor against him,
80757 ^ that he would summon him to jerusalem,
80762 ^ an ambush forming
80764 ^ to kill him on the way.
80769 ^ - indeed therefore
80772 ^ festus answered that
80774 ^ is to be kept - paul in caesarea;
80779 ^ he himself now is about
80782 ^ in quickness to set out.
80785 ^ those therefore
80787 ^ among you,
80789 ^ he says, [those] in power,
80791 ^ having gone down too,
80792 ^ if anything there is in the man
80798 ^ wrong,
80799 ^ let them accuse him.
80839 ^ which not they were able to prove.
80843 ^ - paul made his defense
80846 ^ -: neither against the law of the jews, nor against the temple, nor against caesar, [in] anything have i sinned.
80862 ^ - festus however,
80865 ^ wishing
80866 ^ on the jews a favor to lay,
80870 ^ answering - paul, said,
80874 ^ are you willing
81074 ^ whom was affirming - paul to be alive.
81215 ^ concerning whom, definite anything to write to [my] lord, not i have.
81224 ^ therefore i have brought him before you all, and especially before you, king agrippa,
81235 ^ so that the examination having taken place,
81239 ^ i might have
81240 ^ something to write.
81242 ^ absurd for to me it seems
81284 ^ before you, being about today to defend myself.
81289 ^ especially acquainted being you
81293 ^ with all the of [the] jews customs, and also controversies;
81301 ^ therefore i implore [you]
81303 ^ patiently to hear me.
81306 ^ the indeed then
81309 ^ manner of life of me, which [is] from youth,
81314 ^ - from [its] beginning
81317 ^ having been among the nation of me, in also jerusalem, know all the jews,
81329 ^ knowing me from the first,
81332 ^ if they would be willing
81334 ^ to testify,
81335 ^ that according to the strictest sect - of our religion i lived [as] a pharisee.
81345 ^ and now for [the] hope of the to the fathers of us promise having been made by - god, i stand
81360 ^ being judged,
81361 ^ to which the twelve tribes of us
81366 ^ in earnestness, night and day, serving, hope
81373 ^ to attain;
81374 ^ concerning which hope i am accused by the jews, o king.
81381 ^ why incredible is it judged by you
81386 ^ if - god [the] dead raises?
81391 ^ i indeed therefore thought in myself
81738 ^ are hidden from for him any of these things not. i am persuaded
81745 ^ none
81746 ^ not for is
81749 ^ in a corner done, of these things.
81753 ^ believe you, king agrippa, the prophets?
81758 ^ i know
81759 ^ that you believe.
81761 ^ - then
81763 ^ agrippa [said] to - paul,
81767 ^ within so little me do you persuade
81771 ^ a christian to become?
81773 ^ - and
81775 ^ paul [said],
81776 ^ i would wish - - to god,
81780 ^ both in a little and in much, not only you
81789 ^ but also all those hearing me this day, to become such
81798 ^ as also i am, except the chains these.
81806 ^ rose up then the king and the governor - and bernice
81816 ^ and those sitting with them,
81820 ^ and
81821 ^ having withdrawn, they began speaking to one another
81825 ^ saying
81826 ^ -, nothing of death or of chains worthy any is doing the man this.
81837 ^ agrippa then to festus was saying,
81842 ^ have been released could the man this,
81847 ^ if not he had appealed to caesar.
81851 ^ when now was determined
81854 ^ - sailing our to - italy,
81860 ^ they delivered - both paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion, named julius of the cohort of augustus.
82492 ^ on which they determined,
82495 ^ if they should be able,
82497 ^ to drive the ship.
82500 ^ and
82501 ^ the anchors having cut away, they left [them] in the sea,
82508 ^ at the same time
82509 ^ having loosened the ropes of the rudders.
82514 ^ and having hoisted the foresail
82518 ^ to the blowing [wind], they began making for the shore.
82681 ^ whom
82682 ^ having been saved from the sea, - justice
82688 ^ to live not has permitted.
82691 ^ the [one] indeed then,
82694 ^ having shaken off the creature into the fire, he suffered no injury.
82703 ^ - but they were expecting
82706 ^ him to be about
82708 ^ to become inflamed,
82709 ^ or to fall down suddenly dead.
82713 ^ a while great however of them waiting
82718 ^ and seeing nothing amiss
82722 ^ to him happening,
83853 ^ to those who indeed with endurance in work good, glory and honor and immortality
83864 ^ are seeking, life eternal;
83867 ^ to those however
83869 ^ of self-interest
83871 ^ and disobeying the truth,
83875 ^ being persuaded about however - unrighteousness, wrath and anger;
83882 ^ tribulation and distress upon every soul of man
83889 ^ - working - evil, of jewish both first, and also of greek;
83898 ^ glory however,
83900 ^ and honor, and peace
83904 ^ to everyone - doing - good,
83909 ^ to jewish both first, and to greek.
83914 ^ not for there is partiality with - god.
84625 ^ what then shall we say discovered abraham, the father of us, according to [the] flesh?
84635 ^ if for abraham by works was justified,
84641 ^ he has ground of boasting,
84643 ^ but not toward god.
84647 ^ what for the scripture says?
84652 ^ believed then abraham - god,
84657 ^ and it was reckoned to him for righteousness.”
84662 ^ to the [one] now
84664 ^ working, the reward not is reckoned according to grace,
84671 ^ but according to debt.
84674 ^ to the [one] however not
84677 ^ working,
84678 ^ believing however
84680 ^ on the [one] justifying the ungodly, is reckoned the faith of him for righteousness,
84691 ^ just as also david declares the blessedness of the man
84699 ^ to whom - god credits righteousness apart from works:
84706 ^ blessed
84707 ^ [are they] of whom are forgiven
84709 ^ the lawless deeds,
84711 ^ and of whom are covered
84714 ^ the sins;
84716 ^ blessed [the] man
84718 ^ against whom no not will reckon [the] lord
84723 ^ sin.”
84724 ^ [is] the blessing then
84727 ^ this on the circumcision,
84731 ^ or also on the uncircumcision?
84736 ^ we are saying for
84738 ^ was credited - to abraham the faith as righteousness.
84745 ^ how then was it credited?
84748 ^ in circumcision being,
84751 ^ or in uncircumcision?
84754 ^ not in circumcision,
84757 ^ but in uncircumcision.
84760 ^ and [the] sign he received
84763 ^ of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith that [he had] [while] in the uncircumcision,
84773 ^ for the to be him father
84778 ^ of all those believing, in uncircumcision,
84783 ^ for - to be credited also to them the righteousness,
84790 ^ and father of circumcision to those not of circumcision only,
84798 ^ but also to those walking in the steps of the during uncircumcision faith of the father of us, abraham.
84812 ^ not for through [the] law the promise [was] - to abraham or the descendants of him
84824 ^ that heir he should be
84828 ^ [of the] world,
84829 ^ but through [the] righteousness of faith.
84833 ^ if for those of [the] law [are] heirs,
84839 ^ has been made void - faith,
84842 ^ and made of no effect the promise.
84846 ^ - for
84848 ^ law wrath brings;
84976 ^ what he had promised, able he is
84980 ^ also to do.
84982 ^ therefore also it was credited to him unto righteousness.”
84988 ^ not it was written now on account of him alone
84994 ^ that it was credited to him,
84997 ^ but also on account of us,
85001 ^ to whom it is about to be credited,
85004 ^ to those believing
85006 ^ on the [one] having raised jesus the lord of us out from [the] dead,
85015 ^ who was delivered over for the trespasses of us,
85021 ^ and was raised for the justification of us.
85583 ^ that which for he died, - to sin he died once for all;
85590 ^ that which however he lives, he lives - to god.
85596 ^ so also you, consider
85600 ^ yourselves to be dead indeed
85604 ^ - to sin,
85606 ^ living however - to god in christ jesus.
85613 ^ not therefore let reign - sin in the mortal of you body,
85623 ^ in order - to obey the desires of it.
85629 ^ neither yield the members of you [as] instruments of unrighteousness - to sin,
85638 ^ but yield yourselves - to god,
85643 ^ as out from [the] dead
85646 ^ living,
85647 ^ and the members of you, [as] instruments of righteousness - to god.
85655 ^ sin for you not will rule over,
85660 ^ not for you are under law,
85665 ^ but under grace.
85668 ^ what then?
85670 ^ shall we sin
85671 ^ because not we are under law,
85676 ^ but under grace?
85679 ^ never may it be!
85681 ^ not know you
85683 ^ that to whom you yield yourselves [as] slaves for obedience,
85690 ^ slaves you are
85692 ^ to him whom you obey, whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?
85702 ^ thanks [be] however - to god
85706 ^ that you used to be slaves - of sin,
85711 ^ you have become obedient now from [the] heart,
85715 ^ to which you were handed over to the form of teaching.
85829 ^ to those knowing for law i speak —
85833 ^ that the law rules over the man
85839 ^ for as long as [the] time he is alive?
85843 ^ the for
85845 ^ married woman, to the
85848 ^ living husband is bound by law;
85852 ^ if however should die the husband,
85857 ^ she is cleared from the law of the husband.
85863 ^ then therefore, being alive the husband,
85868 ^ an adulteress she will be called
85870 ^ if she is to man another;
85874 ^ if however should die the husband,
85879 ^ free she is from the law,
85884 ^ [so as for] not to be her an adulteress,
85889 ^ having been to man another.
85892 ^ likewise, brothers of me, also you have been put to death to the law through the body - of christ,
85905 ^ for - to belong you to another,
85910 ^ to the [one] out from [the] dead
85913 ^ having been raised,
85914 ^ so that we should bear fruit - to god.
85918 ^ while for we were in the flesh,
85924 ^ the passions - of sins that [were] through the law were at work in the members of us,
85937 ^ to the bringing forth of fruit - to death.
85942 ^ now however we have been released from the law,
85948 ^ having died
85949 ^ to that which we were bound,
85952 ^ in order for to serve us in newness of [the] spirit, and not in oldness
85961 ^ of [the] letter.
85962 ^ what then shall we say?
85965 ^ [is] the law sin?
85968 ^ never may it be!
85970 ^ but - sin not i have known,
85975 ^ if not by law;
85979 ^ - then for
85982 ^ covetousness, not i had been conscious of,
85985 ^ if not the law had said,
85990 ^ not you shall covet.”
86109 ^ what for i do, not i understand;
86114 ^ not for what i want,
86118 ^ this i do;
86120 ^ but what i hate,
86123 ^ this i do.
86125 ^ if now that which not i do want,
86130 ^ this i do,
86132 ^ i consent to the law,
86135 ^ that [it is] good.
86137 ^ in that case now, no longer i am doing it,
86143 ^ but the
86145 ^ dwelling in me sin.
86149 ^ i know for
86151 ^ that nothing there dwells in me,
86156 ^ that is in the flesh of me, good;
86691 ^ what for sees any does he hope for?
86696 ^ if however,
86698 ^ what not we see we hope for,
86702 ^ in patience we await.
86705 ^ likewise now also, the spirit joins to help the weakness of us;
86714 ^ the for things which we should pray for as it behooves, not we know,
86722 ^ but himself the spirit makes intercession, with groanings inexpressible.
87220 ^ whom now he wants, he hardens.
87224 ^ you will say to me then,
87227 ^ why then still does he find fault?
87231 ^ the for
87233 ^ purpose of him, who is resisting?
87237 ^ o man, but rather, you who are
88505 ^ we are having however gifts according to the grace
88511 ^ - having been given to us
88514 ^ different:
88515 ^ if
88516 ^ prophecy, according to the proportion of the faith;
88522 ^ or
88523 ^ service, in the service;
88527 ^ or
88528 ^ - teaching, in the teaching;
88533 ^ or
88534 ^ - exhorting, in the exhortation;
88610 ^ the same thing toward one another minding,
88615 ^ not the things haughty minding,
88619 ^ but
88620 ^ with the lowly going along.
88623 ^ not be wise in yourselves.
88628 ^ to no one evil for evil repaying,
88633 ^ providing right before all men;
88638 ^ if possible - of you,
88643 ^ with all men living at peace;
88647 ^ never yourselves avenging, beloved;
88651 ^ instead give place - to wrath;
88656 ^ it has been written for:
88658 ^ mine [is] vengeance,
88660 ^ i will repay,
88662 ^ says [the] lord.”
88664 ^ on the contrary, if should hunger the enemy of you,
88670 ^ feed him;
88672 ^ if he should thirst,
88674 ^ give drink him;
88968 ^ the [one] now
88970 ^ being weak in the faith, receive,
88974 ^ not for passing judgment on reasonings.
88978 ^ one indeed believes
88981 ^ to eat all things;
90602 ^ those however
90604 ^ being saved, to us, power of god it is.
90609 ^ it has been written for:
90611 ^ i will destroy the wisdom of the wise,
90616 ^ and the intelligence of the intelligent i will frustrate.”
90622 ^ where [is the] wise?
90624 ^ where [the] scribe?
90626 ^ where [the] debater the age of this?
90631 ^ not has made foolish - god the wisdom of the world?
90639 ^ since for in the wisdom - of god, not knew the world through the wisdom - god,
90655 ^ was pleased - god,
90658 ^ through the foolishness of the proclamation, to save
90664 ^ those believing.
90666 ^ seeing that both jews signs ask for,
90671 ^ and greeks wisdom seek,
90675 ^ we however preach christ
90679 ^ having been crucified,
90680 ^ to [the] jewish indeed a stumbling block,
90683 ^ to gentiles now foolishness;
90686 ^ to them however
90688 ^ the called, jews both and greeks, christ of god [the] power and of god [the] wisdom.
90700 ^ for the foolishness - of god wiser - than men is,
90709 ^ and the weakness - of god stronger - than men.
90717 ^ consider for the calling of you, brothers,
90723 ^ that not many wise according to flesh [were],
90729 ^ not many powerful,
90732 ^ not many of noble birth.
90735 ^ but the foolish things of the world has chosen - god
90743 ^ that he might shame the wise;
90747 ^ and the weak things of the world chose - god
90755 ^ that he might shame the strong;
90759 ^ and the low-born of the world, and
90765 ^ the things being despised, chose - god,
90770 ^ [also] the things not
90772 ^ being,
90773 ^ that
90774 ^ the things being he might annul,
90777 ^ so that not might boast all flesh before - god.
90785 ^ out of him however, you are in christ jesus,
90793 ^ who has been made wisdom unto us from god, righteousness and also sanctification and redemption,
90805 ^ in order that, as it has been written:
91249 ^ foundation for
91251 ^ another, no one is able
91254 ^ to lay,
91255 ^ besides the [one] being already laid,
91258 ^ which is jesus christ.
91262 ^ if now anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, stones precious, wood, hay, straw,
91276 ^ of each the work manifest will become;
91281 ^ the for
91283 ^ day will disclose [it],
91285 ^ because in fire it is revealed;
91289 ^ and of each the work, what sort it is,
91295 ^ the fire itself will prove.
91299 ^ if of anyone the work will remain
91304 ^ which he built up,
91306 ^ a reward he will receive.
91308 ^ if of anyone the work will be burned up,
91313 ^ he will suffer loss;
91314 ^ he himself however will be saved,
91317 ^ so however as through fire.
91322 ^ not know you
91324 ^ that temple of god you yourselves are,
91328 ^ and the spirit - of god dwells? in you
91336 ^ if anyone the temple - of god destroys,
91343 ^ will destroy him - god;
91347 ^ - for
91349 ^ the temple - of god holy is,
91354 ^ which are you.
91357 ^ no one himself let deceive;
91360 ^ if anyone thinks [himself]
91363 ^ wise to be among you in the age this,
91371 ^ foolish let him become,
91373 ^ so that he may become wise.
91376 ^ the for
91378 ^ wisdom of the world this, foolishness with - god is.
91387 ^ it has been written for:
91575 ^ already satiated you are;
91578 ^ already you have been enriched;
91580 ^ apart from us you reigned,
91583 ^ and i wish that really you did reign,
91587 ^ so that also we you might reign with.
91592 ^ i think for,
91594 ^ - god us - apostles last has exhibited, as appointed to death,
91603 ^ because a spectacle we have become to the world, both to angels and to men.
91612 ^ we [are] fools on account of christ,
91616 ^ you however wise in christ;
91621 ^ we weak,
91623 ^ you however strong;
91626 ^ you honored,
91628 ^ we however without honor. as far as the present hour,
91635 ^ both we hunger
91637 ^ and thirst,
91639 ^ and are poorly clad,
91641 ^ and are buffeted,
91643 ^ and wander homeless,
91645 ^ and we toil,
91647 ^ working with [our] own hands.
92486 ^ to those now
92488 ^ having married i give this charge — not i, but the lord —
92495 ^ a wife from a husband not is to be separated;
92500 ^ if however indeed she is separated,
92504 ^ let her remain unmarried,
92506 ^ or to the husband be reconciled;
92510 ^ and a husband a wife not is to send away.
92515 ^ to the now
92517 ^ rest i say — i not the lord:
92523 ^ if any brother a wife has
92528 ^ unbelieving,
92529 ^ and she consents
92532 ^ to dwell with him,
92535 ^ not let him divorce her.
92538 ^ and a woman if
92541 ^ any has a husband unbelieving,
92545 ^ and he consents
92548 ^ to dwell with her,
92551 ^ not let her divorce the husband.
92555 ^ is sanctified for the husband - unbelieving, in the wife;
92564 ^ and is sanctified the wife - unbelieving, in the husband;
92573 ^ else then the children of you unclean are;
92580 ^ now however holy they are.
92584 ^ if however the unbeliever separates himself,
92589 ^ let him separate himself;
92590 ^ not is under bondage the brother or the sister in - such [cases].
92600 ^ into however
92602 ^ peace has called you - god.
92607 ^ how for know you, wife,
92611 ^ if the husband you will save?
92615 ^ or how know you, husband,
92619 ^ if the wife you will save?
92623 ^ if not to each, as has assigned the lord,
92630 ^ to each as has called - god,
92635 ^ so let him walk.
92637 ^ and thus in the churches all i prescribe.
92939 ^ what he wills let him do;
92942 ^ not he does sin;
92944 ^ let them marry.
92945 ^ he who however stands in the heart of him firm,
92953 ^ not having necessity,
92956 ^ authority however having over the own will,
92963 ^ and this has judged, in the own heart,
93007 ^ to whom she wills to be married,
93010 ^ only in [the] lord.
93013 ^ more blessed however she is,
93016 ^ if in the same manner she should remain, according to - my judgment;
93023 ^ i think now myself also
93026 ^ [the] spirit of god to have.
93029 ^ concerning now
93031 ^ the things sacrificed to idols, we know
93034 ^ indeed all knowledge we have.
93038 ^ - knowledge puffs up,
93041 ^ - but
93043 ^ love builds up.
93045 ^ if anyone thinks
93048 ^ to have known anything,
93050 ^ not yet does he know
93052 ^ as it is necessary
93054 ^ to know.
93055 ^ if however anyone loves - god,
93061 ^ he is known by him.
93065 ^ concerning the eating therefore
93069 ^ of the things sacrificed to idols, we know
93072 ^ that nothing an idol [is] in [the] world,
93077 ^ and that [there is] no god,
93081 ^ if not one.
93084 ^ even truly if indeed there are
93088 ^ [those] called gods, whether in heaven or on earth,
93096 ^ as there are gods many, and lords many,
93103 ^ yet to us [there is] one god, the father,
93109 ^ of whom [are] the things all,
93113 ^ and we for him;
93117 ^ and one lord, jesus christ,
93122 ^ by whom [are] the things all,
93126 ^ and we through him.
93130 ^ but not in all [is] this knowledge.
93136 ^ some now, - by habit until now,
93142 ^ of the idol
93144 ^ as of a thing sacrificed to an idol eat;
93147 ^ and the conscience of them
93151 ^ weak being, it is defiled.
93154 ^ food however us not will commend to god;
93161 ^ neither if not we should eat
93165 ^ do we come short,
93166 ^ nor if we should eat
93169 ^ have we an advantage.
93170 ^ be careful however,
93172 ^ lest somehow the right of you this an occasion of stumbling becomes to those being weak.
93182 ^ if for anyone sees you,
93187 ^ - having knowledge,
93190 ^ in an idol’s temple eating,
93193 ^ not the conscience
93196 ^ of him weak being, will be built up,
93200 ^ so as the things sacrificed to idols
93204 ^ to eat?
93205 ^ is destroyed for
93207 ^ the [one] being weak through - your knowledge, the brother
93215 ^ for whom christ died.
93219 ^ thus then sinning against the brothers
93225 ^ and wounding their - conscience
93230 ^ being weak, against christ you sin.
93234 ^ therefore if food snares the brother of me,
93241 ^ never not shall i eat meat to the age,
93248 ^ so that not the brother of me i might snare.
93254 ^ not am i free?
93257 ^ not am i an apostle?
93260 ^ not jesus the lord of us have i seen?
93266 ^ not the work of me, you are, in [the] lord.
93274 ^ if to others not i am an apostle,
93279 ^ yet at least to you i am;
93283 ^ the for
93285 ^ seal of my the apostleship, you are in [the] lord.
93293 ^ - my defense
93296 ^ to those me
93298 ^ examining is this.
93301 ^ no not have we [the] right
93305 ^ to eat
93306 ^ and to drink?
93308 ^ no not have we authority
93312 ^ a sister, a wife, to take about,
93315 ^ as also the other apostles, and the brothers of the lord, and cephas?
93327 ^ or only i and barnabas, not have we authority
93335 ^ not to work?
93337 ^ who serves as a soldier at his own expense at any time?
93342 ^ who plants a vineyard,
93345 ^ and the fruit of it not does eat?
93351 ^ or who shepherds a flock,
93355 ^ and from the milk of the flock not does drink?
93363 ^ not according to man, these things do i speak?
93368 ^ or also the law these things not says?
93375 ^ in for
93377 ^ the of moses law, it has been written:
93381 ^ not you shall muzzle an ox
93384 ^ treading out grain.”
93385 ^ not for the oxen is there care - with god?
93391 ^ or because of us entirely is he speaking?
93396 ^ for sake of us for it was written,
93400 ^ because ought
93402 ^ in hope
93404 ^ the [one] plowing
93406 ^ to plow,
93407 ^ and
93408 ^ the [one] threshing,
93410 ^ in hope
93412 ^ - to partake.
93414 ^ if we among you - spiritual things have sown,
93420 ^ [is it] a great thing
93421 ^ if we, from you - material things will reap?
93427 ^ if others of the over you authority partake,
93433 ^ [should] not more we?
93436 ^ but not we did use the right this.
93442 ^ instead, all things we bear,
93445 ^ so that not any hindrance we should place to the gospel of christ.
93454 ^ not know you
93456 ^ that
93457 ^ those in the temple
93460 ^ working, the things of the temple eat;
93887 ^ beyond what you are able,
93890 ^ but will provide, with the temptation, also the escape,
93898 ^ - to be able
93900 ^ to endure [it].
93901 ^ therefore, beloved of me, flee from - idolatry.
93908 ^ as to sensible [ones] i speak;
93911 ^ judge for yourselves
93913 ^ what i say.
93915 ^ the cup - of blessing
93919 ^ that we bless, not a participation is it
93924 ^ in the blood - of christ?
93928 ^ the bread
93930 ^ that we break, not a participation in the body - of christ is it?
93939 ^ because [there is] one loaf, one body the many we are;
93947 ^ - for
93949 ^ all of the one loaf we partake.
93955 ^ consider - israel according to flesh:
93960 ^ not
93961 ^ those eating the sacrifices, fellow partakers in the altar are?
93969 ^ what then do i mean?
93972 ^ that what is sacrificed to an idol anything is,
93976 ^ or that an idol anything is?
93981 ^ rather that
93983 ^ what they sacrifice to demons and not to god they sacrifice.
93990 ^ not i do wish now,
93993 ^ you fellow partakers - with demons to be.
93998 ^ not you are able
94000 ^ [the] cup of [the] lord to drink,
94003 ^ and [the] cup of demons.
94006 ^ not you are able
94008 ^ of [the] table of [the] lord to partake,
94011 ^ and of [the] table of demons.
94014 ^ or do we provoke to jealousy the lord?
94018 ^ not stronger than he are we?
94022 ^ all things are lawful,
94024 ^ but not all things are profitable.
94028 ^ all things are lawful,
94030 ^ but not all edify.
94034 ^ no one the [good] of himself let seek,
94038 ^ but that of the other.
94042 ^ everything - in the meat market
94046 ^ being sold, eat,
94048 ^ nothing inquiring on account of - conscience,
94053 ^ the lord’s,” for, [is] the earth, and the fullness of it.”
94062 ^ if anyone invites you
94066 ^ of the unbelieving,
94068 ^ and you wish
94070 ^ to go,
94071 ^ everything - being set before you eat,
94076 ^ nothing inquiring on account of - conscience.
94081 ^ if however anyone to you should say,
94086 ^ this offered to an idol is,
94089 ^ not do eat, on account of him
94093 ^ - having shown [it], and - conscience —
94098 ^ [the] conscience now, i am saying,
94101 ^ not -
94103 ^ your own, but that of the other;
94108 ^ that what for the freedom of me is judged by another’s conscience?
94117 ^ if i with thankfulness partake,
94121 ^ why am i denounced
94123 ^ for that which i give thanks?
94127 ^ whether therefore you eat,
94130 ^ or drink,
94132 ^ or whatever you do,
94135 ^ all things to the glory of god do.
94140 ^ without offense both to jews be you,
94144 ^ and greeks, and to the church - of god —
94151 ^ as i also all in all things please,
94156 ^ not seeking the of myself profit,
94161 ^ but that of the many,
94165 ^ that they may be saved.
94167 ^ imitators of me be,
94170 ^ as i also [am] of christ.
94173 ^ i commend now you
94176 ^ that in all things me you have remembered,
94180 ^ and as i delivered to you, the teachings
94186 ^ you are keeping.
94187 ^ i want however you
94190 ^ to know
94191 ^ that of every man the head - christ is,
94199 ^ [the] head now
94201 ^ of [the] woman [is] the man,
94204 ^ [the] head now
94206 ^ - of christ - god.
94210 ^ every man
94212 ^ praying
94213 ^ or prophesying,
94215 ^ [anything] on [his] head having, dishonors the head of him.
94222 ^ every now
94224 ^ woman
94225 ^ praying
94226 ^ or prophesying, uncovered with the head, dishonors the head of her;
94235 ^ one for it is,
94238 ^ and the same,
94241 ^ - with having been shaven.
94243 ^ if for not covers her head a woman,
94248 ^ also let her be shorn.
94250 ^ if [it is] now disgraceful to a woman
94254 ^ - to be shorn
94256 ^ or to be shaven,
94258 ^ let her cover her head.
94259 ^ a man truly for not ought
94264 ^ to cover the head,
94267 ^ image and glory of god being;
94272 ^ the woman however, [the] glory of man is.
94278 ^ not for is man of woman,
94284 ^ but woman of man.
94288 ^ truly for not was created man on account of the woman,
94296 ^ but woman on account of the man.
94301 ^ because of this, ought the woman
94306 ^ authority to have on the head, on account of the angels.
94314 ^ however, neither [is] woman separate from man,
94319 ^ nor man separate from woman, in [the] lord.
94325 ^ just as for the woman of the man [is],
94332 ^ so also the man by the woman [is];
94339 ^ the however
94341 ^ all things of - god.
94345 ^ in you yourselves judge:
94349 ^ becoming is it
94351 ^ for a woman revealed, - to god to pray?
94356 ^ not even - nature itself does teach you
94362 ^ that a man indeed, if he has long hair,
94367 ^ a dishonor to him it is;
94370 ^ a woman however if she has long hair,
94374 ^ glory to her it is?
94377 ^ for the long hair instead of a covering is given to her.
94384 ^ if now anyone is inclined
94388 ^ contentious to be,
94390 ^ we such custom no [other] have,
94395 ^ nor the churches - of god.
95062 ^ to the [parts] being deficient more abundant having given
95066 ^ honor,
95067 ^ that not there should be division in the body,
95074 ^ but the same for one another should have concern, the members.
95082 ^ and if suffers one member,
95087 ^ suffer with [it] all the members;
95091 ^ if is honored one member,
95095 ^ rejoice with [it] all the members.
95099 ^ you now are [the] body of christ,
95104 ^ and members in particular.
95108 ^ and some indeed has appointed - god in the church,
95117 ^ first apostles,
95119 ^ secondly prophets,
95121 ^ third teachers,
95123 ^ then miracles,
95125 ^ then gifts of healing, helping, administrating, various kinds of tongues.
95132 ^ not [are] all apostles?
95135 ^ not all prophets?
95138 ^ not all teachers?
95141 ^ not [have] all miracles?
95144 ^ not all gifts have
95148 ^ of healings?
95149 ^ not all in tongues do speak?
95153 ^ not all do interpret?
95156 ^ be desirous of however the gifts - greater.
95162 ^ and now, according to a more surpassing way, to you i show.
95169 ^ if in the tongues - of men i speak,
95175 ^ and - of angels,
95178 ^ love however not have,
95182 ^ i have become a brass
95184 ^ sounding, or a cymbal
95187 ^ clanging.
95188 ^ and if i should have prophecy
95192 ^ and understand the mysteries all, and all the knowledge,
95201 ^ and if i should have all the faith,
95207 ^ so as mountains
95209 ^ to remove,
95210 ^ love however not have,
95214 ^ nothing i am.
95216 ^ even if i may give away
95218 ^ all the possessions of me,
95222 ^ and if i may deliver up the body of me
95228 ^ that i may boast,
95230 ^ love however not have,
95234 ^ nothing i am profited.
95236 ^ - love is patient,
95239 ^ is kind; - love
95242 ^ not is envious; - love
95246 ^ not is boastful,
95248 ^ not is puffed up,
95250 ^ not acts unbecomingly;
95252 ^ not seeks the things of its own,
95256 ^ not is easily provoked,
95258 ^ not it keeps account - of wrongs;
95262 ^ not delights at - unrighteousness,
95267 ^ rejoices however in the truth.
95271 ^ all things it bears,
95273 ^ all things believes,
95275 ^ all things hopes,
95277 ^ all things endures.
95279 ^ - love never fails;
95283 ^ if however [there are] prophesies,
95286 ^ they will be done away;
95287 ^ if tongues,
95289 ^ they will be ceased;
95290 ^ if knowledge
95292 ^ it will pass away.
95293 ^ in part for we know,
95297 ^ and in part we prophesy;
95301 ^ when however should come the perfect,
95306 ^ the in part will be done away.
95310 ^ when i was a child,
95313 ^ i was speaking like a child,
95316 ^ i was thinking like a child,
95319 ^ i was reasoning like a child;
95322 ^ when i became a man,
95325 ^ i did away with the things of the child.
95329 ^ we see for presently, through a glass in obscurity;
95336 ^ then however, face to face;
95341 ^ presently, i know in part;
95345 ^ then however i will know fully,
95348 ^ as also i have been fully known.
95351 ^ now however abide faith, hope, love, the things three these;
95360 ^ [the] greatest however
95362 ^ of these [is] - love.
95365 ^ earnestly pursue - love;
95368 ^ earnestly desire now - spiritual gifts,
95372 ^ especially now that you might prophesy.
98559 ^ the dwelling of us which [is] from heaven to be clothed with longing.
98567 ^ if indeed also
98570 ^ having been clothed, not naked we will be found.
98574 ^ and for,
98576 ^ - being in the tent, we groan,
98582 ^ being burdened,
98583 ^ because that not we do wish
98587 ^ to be unclothed
98588 ^ but
98589 ^ to be clothed,

98856 ^ the [one] not

98904 ^ nothing before no one placing
98908 ^ an obstacle,
98909 ^ so that not should be blemished the ministry,
98914 ^ rather,
98915 ^ in everything, we are commending ourselves as god’s servants,
98922 ^ in endurance great, in tribulations, in hardships, in distresses, in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings; in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in [the] spirit holy, in love genuine; in [the] word of truth, in [the] power of god; with the weapons - of righteousness for the right hand and for [the] left; through glory and dishonor, through bad report and good report;
98980 ^ as imposters,
98982 ^ and yet true;
99005 ^ many yet enriching;
99858 ^ - therefore the proof of the love of you and of our boasting about you, to them show in face of the churches.
99876 ^ concerning now for
99879 ^ the service - for the saints, superfluous for me it is
99888 ^ - to write to you.
99891 ^ i know for the readiness of you,
99896 ^ which concerning you i boast of to macedonians,
99901 ^ that achaia has been prepared from a year ago,
99906 ^ and - your zeal has been provoking the greater number.
99913 ^ i have sent however the brothers,
99917 ^ that not the boasting of us which [is] about you should be made void in the matter this,
99930 ^ that as i have been saying,
99933 ^ prepared you may be.
99935 ^ not perhaps if should come with me macedonians
99942 ^ and find you unprepared,
99946 ^ would be put to shame we —
99948 ^ that not we might say
99951 ^ you — in the confidence this.
99956 ^ necessary therefore i esteemed [it]
100108 ^ through the proof of the service this, [they] glorifying - god at the submission of the of confession of you to the gospel - of christ and [the] generosity of the participation toward them and toward all;
100137 ^ and their supplication [is] for you, a longing for you on account of the
100146 ^ surpassing grace - of god upon you.
100152 ^ thanks [be] - to god for the indescribable of him gift!
100160 ^ myself now
100162 ^ i, paul, exhort you by the meekness and gentleness - of christ,
100173 ^ who as to appearance indeed [am] humble among you,
100228 ^ arguments overthrowing,
100230 ^ and every high thing
100233 ^ lifting itself up against the knowledge - of god,
100239 ^ and
100240 ^ taking captive every thought into the obedience - of christ,
100248 ^ and
100249 ^ in readiness having,
100654 ^ what however i do, also i will do,
100659 ^ so that i might cut off the opportunity
100663 ^ of those desiring an opportunity
100666 ^ that
100667 ^ in what they are boasting, they might be found
100671 ^ as also we.
100674 ^ - for
100676 ^ such [are] false apostles, workers deceitful,
100680 ^ disguising themselves as apostles of christ.
100684 ^ and no wonder;
100687 ^ himself for
100689 ^ - satan masquerades as an angel of light.
100695 ^ [it is] not surprising therefore,
100698 ^ if also the servants of him masquerade as servants of righteousness,
100707 ^ whose - end will be according to the deeds of them.
100715 ^ again i say,
100717 ^ no one
100719 ^ me should think a fool to be;
100723 ^ if however otherwise
100726 ^ even as a fool receive me,
100731 ^ that i also little a may boast.
100736 ^ what i am saying, not according to [the] lord am i saying,
100742 ^ but as in foolishness, in this the confidence - of boasting.
100752 ^ since many boast according to [the] flesh,
100757 ^ i also will boast.
100759 ^ gladly for you bear with - fools,
100764 ^ wise being!
100766 ^ you bear [it] for
100768 ^ if anyone you enslaves,
100772 ^ if anyone devours [you],
100775 ^ if anyone takes [from you],
100778 ^ if anyone exalts himself,
100781 ^ if anyone in [the] face of you strikes [you].
100787 ^ as to dishonor i speak,
100790 ^ as that we have been weak!
100794 ^ in whatever however - anyone might be daring —
100800 ^ in foolishness i speak —
100803 ^ am daring i also.
100805 ^ hebrews are they?
100807 ^ i also.
100808 ^ israelites are they?
100810 ^ i also.
100811 ^ descendants of abraham are they?
100814 ^ i also.
100815 ^ servants of christ are they?
102331 ^ that which then now i live in [the] flesh, through faith i live,
102340 ^ that from the son - of god,
102345 ^ the [one] having loved me
102348 ^ and having given up himself for me.
102353 ^ not i do set aside the grace - of god;
102359 ^ if for through [the] law righteousness [is],
102364 ^ then christ for naught died.”
102368 ^ o foolish galatians! who you has bewitched,
102374 ^ whose before eyes jesus christ was publicly portrayed
102380 ^ [as] having been crucified?
102381 ^ this only i wish to learn from you,
102387 ^ by works of [the] law the spirit did you receive, or by hearing of faith?
102397 ^ so foolish are you?
102855 ^ under the basic principles of the world were held in bondage.
102862 ^ when however had come the fullness of the time,
102869 ^ sent forth - god the son of him,
102875 ^ having been born of a woman,
102878 ^ having been born under [the] law,
102881 ^ that those under [the] law he might redeem,
102886 ^ so that the divine adoption as sons we might receive.
102890 ^ because now you are sons,
102894 ^ sent forth - god the spirit of the son of him into the hearts of us,
102953 ^ to which again anew to be enslaved you desire?
102958 ^ days you observe,
102960 ^ and months and seasons and years.
102966 ^ i fear for you,
102968 ^ lest perhaps in vain i have toiled for you.
102974 ^ become as i [am],
102977 ^ because i also [have become] as you,
102981 ^ brothers, i implore you.
102984 ^ in nothing me have you wronged.
102987 ^ you know now
102989 ^ that in weakness of the flesh i proclaimed the gospel to you at the first;
102998 ^ and the test of you in the flesh of me, not you did despise [me],
103008 ^ nor reject [me] with contempt;
103010 ^ but as an angel of god, you received me even as christ jesus.
103019 ^ what then the blessedness of you?
103024 ^ i bear witness for to you
103027 ^ that, if possible,
103698 ^ - and
103700 ^ [in] well doing, not we should grow weary;
103704 ^ in time for
103706 ^ due, we will reap a harvest
103708 ^ not giving up.
103710 ^ so then, as occasion we have,
103715 ^ we should work - good toward all,
103720 ^ especially now toward those of the household of the of faith.
103727 ^ see
103728 ^ in how large to you
103730 ^ letters i have written with my own hand.
103735 ^ as many as wish
103737 ^ to have a fair appearance in [the] flesh,
103740 ^ these compel you
103743 ^ to be circumcised,
103744 ^ only that for the cross - of christ not they might be persecuted.
103752 ^ not even for
103754 ^ those being circumcised themselves [the] law keep,
103759 ^ but they desire you
103762 ^ to be circumcised,
103763 ^ so that in - your flesh they may boast.
103769 ^ for me however, never may it be
103773 ^ to boast,
103774 ^ if never in the cross of the lord of us jesus christ,
103784 ^ through which to me [the] world has been crucified,
103789 ^ and i [to the] world.
103791 ^ neither for circumcision anything is,
103796 ^ nor uncircumcision;
103798 ^ instead a new creation.
103801 ^ and as many as those who rule by this will walk,
103807 ^ peace [be] upon them,
103810 ^ and mercy; and upon the israel - of god.
103818 ^ the henceforth, troubles to me no one let give;

103878 ^ blessed [be] the god and father of the lord of us jesus christ,
103888 ^ the [one] having blessed us with every blessing spiritual in the heavenly realms in christ,
103900 ^ just as he chose us in him before [the] foundation of [the] world,
103908 ^ to be for us holy and blameless before him,
103915 ^ in love having predestined us for divine adoption as sons through jesus christ, to himself, according to the good pleasure of the will of him, to [the] praise of [the] glory of the of grace of him,

103941 ^ in the beloved [one],

103963 ^ which he lavished upon us
103967 ^ in all wisdom and understanding, having made known to us the mystery of the will of him according to the pleasure of him,
103983 ^ which he purposed in him for [the] administration of the fullness of the times,

103999 ^ the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth, in him,
104010 ^ in whom also we have obtained an inheritance,

104027 ^ for - to be us to [the] praise of [the] glory of him,
104340 ^ by grace you are saved —
104343 ^ and he raised [us] up together
104345 ^ and seated [us] together in the heavenly realms in christ jesus,
104353 ^ in order that he might show in the ages
104358 ^ that [are] coming the

104936 ^ exhort therefore you i, the prisoner in [the] lord,
104944 ^ worthily to walk
104946 ^ of the calling
104948 ^ to which you were called, with all humility and gentleness,
104955 ^ with patience, bearing with one another in love,

105020 ^ therefore it says:
105476 ^ this for you know, realizing

105487 ^ who is an idolater, not has inheritance in the kingdom - of christ, and of god.
105500 ^ no one you let deceive with empty words,
105505 ^ because of these things for comes the wrath - of god upon the sons - of disobedience.
105518 ^ not therefore be partakers with them.
105523 ^ you were for once darkness;
105527 ^ now however, light in [the] lord;

105549 ^ what is well-pleasing to the lord.
105554 ^ and not have fellowship with the works - unfruitful - of darkness;
105563 ^ rather however even expose [them];

105577 ^ - but

106148 ^ through all prayer and supplication, praying in every season in [the] spirit,
106159 ^ and
106160 ^ unto this very thing, watching with all perseverance and supplication for all - saints, and also for me,
106175 ^ that to me may be given divine utterance in [the] opening of the mouth of me, with boldness
106186 ^ to make known the mystery of the gospel,

106270 ^ paul and timothy, servants of christ jesus, to all the saints in christ jesus
106282 ^ - being in philippi, with [the] overseers and deacons:
106290 ^ grace to you
106292 ^ and peace from god father of us and [the] lord jesus christ.
106302 ^ i thank the god of me upon every - remembrance of you,
106311 ^ always in every supplication of me for all of you, with joy the supplication making for the partnership of you in the gospel from the first day until - now,

106341 ^ that
106342 ^ the [one] having begun in you a work good will complete [it] until [the] day of christ jesus.
106353 ^ accordingly, it is right for me
106357 ^ this to feel about all of you,
106362 ^ since - have i in the heart you; in both the chains of me, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel,
106383 ^ fellow partakers with me of grace all you are.
106390 ^ witness for
106392 ^ my - god [is],
106395 ^ how i long after all you in [the] affection of christ jesus.
106403 ^ and this i pray,
106406 ^ that the love of you, yet more and more may abound in knowledge and all discernment,
106420 ^ for - to approve you
106424 ^ the things being excellent,
106426 ^ so that you may be pure and blameless unto [the] day of christ,

106446 ^ to know now you, i want, brothers,
106451 ^ that the things concerning me, really to [the] advancement of the gospel have turned out,
106461 ^ so as for the chains of me clearly known
106466 ^ in christ to have become in all the palace guard, and to the rest all;
106477 ^ and - most of the brothers,
106482 ^ in [the] lord trusting by the chains of me, more abundantly to dare
106490 ^ fearlessly the word to speak.
106494 ^ some indeed even from envy and strife,
106501 ^ some however also from goodwill - christ are proclaiming —
106509 ^ the [ones] indeed out of love,
106513 ^ knowing
106514 ^ that for defense of the gospel i am appointed;
106520 ^ the [ones] however out of selfish ambition - christ are proclaiming, not purely,
106529 ^ supposing
106530 ^ tribulation to add to the chains of me.
106535 ^ what then?
106537 ^ only that in every way, whether in pretext or in truth, christ is proclaimed.
106547 ^ and in this i rejoice.
106551 ^ yes, and i will rejoice.
106554 ^ i know for
106556 ^ that this for me will turn out to deliverance through - your prayer and [the] provision of the spirit of jesus christ, according to the earnest expectation and hope of me
106578 ^ that in nothing i will be ashamed,
106582 ^ but in all boldness, as always also now, will be magnified christ in the body of me, whether by life or by death.
107499 ^ those things earthly
107502 ^ minding.
107503 ^ of us for
107505 ^ the citizenship in [the] heavens exists,
107510 ^ from whence also a savior we are awaiting,
107515 ^ [the] lord jesus christ,
107518 ^ who will transform the body - of humiliation of us, conformed to the body of the glory of himself, according to the working
107534 ^ - enabling him
107537 ^ even to subdue to himself - all things.
107542 ^ therefore, brothers of me, beloved and longed for, [the] joy and crown of me, in this way stand firm in [the] lord, beloved.
107557 ^ euodia i exhort
107559 ^ and syntyche i exhort,
107562 ^ the same to be of mind in [the] lord.
107567 ^ yes, i ask also you, true yokefellow,
107573 ^ help these [women],
107575 ^ who in the gospel labored together with me, with also clement and the rest of [the] fellow workers of me,
107589 ^ whose - names [are] in [the] book of life.
107595 ^ rejoice in [the] lord always;
107599 ^ again i will say,
107601 ^ rejoice!
107602 ^ the gentleness of you let be known to all men.
107608 ^ the lord [is] near.
107611 ^ nothing be anxious about,

107630 ^ and the peace - of god
107635 ^ - surpassing all understanding will guard the hearts of you and the minds of you in christ jesus.
107650 ^ - finally, brothers, whatever is true,
107656 ^ whatever venerable,
107658 ^ whatever right,
107660 ^ whatever pure,
107662 ^ whatever lovely,
107664 ^ whatever admirable —
107666 ^ if any excellence
107669 ^ and if any praise —
107673 ^ these things think on.
107675 ^ what also you have learned
107678 ^ and have received
107680 ^ and have heard
107682 ^ and have seen in me,
107686 ^ these things practice;
107688 ^ and the god - of peace will be with you.
107696 ^ i rejoiced however in [the] lord greatly
107701 ^ that now at last you revived
107705 ^ the for me
107708 ^ caring;
107709 ^ wherein which also you were concerned,
107713 ^ you were lacking opportunity however.
107715 ^ not that as to destitution i speak;
107720 ^ i for have learned
108735 ^ which he has seen detailing,
108738 ^ vainly being puffed up by the mind of the flesh of him,
108746 ^ and not holding fast to the head,
108751 ^ from whom all the body,
108756 ^ by the joints and ligaments being supplied
108762 ^ and being knit together, increases with the increase - of god.
108769 ^ if you have died with christ away from the principles of the world,
108778 ^ why
108779 ^ as if living in [the] world, do you submit to decrees:
108784 ^ not you should handle!
108786 ^ not you should taste!
108788 ^ not you should touch!
108790 ^ which are
108792 ^ all unto decay with the use, according to the commandments and teachings - of men,
108804 ^ which are
108806 ^ an appearance indeed having
108809 ^ of wisdom, in self-imposed worship and humility and harsh treatment of [the] body,
108817 ^ not of honor a certain, against [the] indulgence of the flesh.
108825 ^ if then you have been raised with - christ,
108830 ^ the things above seek,
108833 ^ where - christ is
108837 ^ at [the] right hand - of god sitting.
108842 ^ the things above set [your] minds on,
108845 ^ not the things on the earth.
108850 ^ you have died for,
108852 ^ and the life of you has been hidden with - christ in - god.
108863 ^ when - christ may be revealed,
108867 ^ the life of you,
108870 ^ then also you with him will appear in glory.
108878 ^ put to death therefore the members which [are] upon the earth: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, desire evil, and - covetousness,
108894 ^ which is idolatry,
108897 ^ because of which things is coming the wrath - of god on the sons of disobedience,
108909 ^ in which also you walked once
108915 ^ when you were living in them.
108919 ^ now however, put off also you - all [these] things: anger, rage, malice, slander, foul language out of the mouth of you.
108935 ^ not do lie to one another,
108939 ^ having put off the old man with the practices of him,
108947 ^ and
108948 ^ having put on the new,
108951 ^ the [one] being renewed in knowledge according to [the] image
108957 ^ of the [one] having created him,
108960 ^ where not there is greek and jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, scythian, slave, free;

117286 ^ - melchizedek, king of salem, priest - of god - most high,
117295 ^ - having met abraham
117298 ^ returning from the slaughter of the kings
117304 ^ and having blessed him,
117307 ^ [is he] to whom also a tenth of all apportioned abraham, first indeed
117316 ^ being translated, king of righteousness;
117319 ^ then and also, king of salem,
117324 ^ which is, king of peace.
117328 ^ without father, without mother, without genealogy,
117331 ^ neither beginning of days nor of life end having,
117338 ^ having been made like however the son - of god, he remains a priest unto - all time.
117349 ^ consider now
117351 ^ how great this one [was],
117353 ^ to whom even a tenth abraham gave out of the best spoils,
117361 ^ the patriarch.
117363 ^ and
117364 ^ those indeed, out from the sons of levi, the priestly office receiving, a commandment have
117661 ^ those drawing near through him - to god,
117667 ^ always living
117669 ^ for - to intercede for them.
117674 ^ such indeed for us also was fitting
117679 ^ a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled,
117683 ^ having been separated from - sinners,
117687 ^ and higher than the heavens having become,
117692 ^ who not has every day need,
117698 ^ as the high priests, first for the own sins, sacrifices to offer up,
117708 ^ then for those of the people;
117712 ^ this for he did once for all,
117716 ^ himself having offered up.
117718 ^ the law for men appoints as high priests,
117936 ^ putting laws of me into the mind of them,
117943 ^ and upon hearts of them i will inscribe them;
117949 ^ and i will be to them for god,
117954 ^ and they will be to me for a people.
117960 ^ and no not shall they teach each the neighbor of him,
117968 ^ and each the brother of him
117973 ^ saying,
117974 ^ know the lord,’
117977 ^ because all will know me,
117981 ^ from [the] least to [the] greatest of them,
117986 ^ because merciful i will be
117989 ^ toward the iniquities of them,

118555 ^ otherwise not - would they have ceased
118559 ^ being offered,
118560 ^ because of - none
118563 ^ having any longer
118565 ^ conscience of sins,
118567 ^ those serving
118569 ^ once having been cleansed?

118578 ^ impossible [it is] indeed [for the] blood of bulls and of goats

118905 ^ having set aside anyone [the] law of moses, without mercies on the basis of two or three witnesses, he dies.
118917 ^ how much think you worse will he deserve
118921 ^ punishment,
118922 ^ the [one] the son - of god
118927 ^ having trampled upon, and
118929 ^ the blood of the covenant ordinary having esteemed,
119210 ^ that he was going to receive for an inheritance,
119215 ^ and went out,
119217 ^ not knowing
119219 ^ where he is going.
119221 ^ by faith he sojourned in [the] land of the promise, as [in] a foreign [country],
119229 ^ in tents having dwelt with isaac and jacob,
119236 ^ the joint-heirs of the promise - same.
119242 ^ he was awaiting for the

119689 ^ having been commended through the faith, not did receive the promise,
119697 ^ - god for us better something having planned,
119704 ^ so that not apart from us they should be made perfect.
119709 ^ therefore also we,
119712 ^ such a great having
119714 ^ encompassing us a cloud of witnesses,
119718 ^ weight having laid aside
119720 ^ every, and the easily entangling sin, with endurance should run the

119770 ^ so that not you shall grow weary, in the souls of you
119776 ^ fainting.
119777 ^ not yet unto blood have you resisted,
119781 ^ against - sin struggling,
119785 ^ and you have forgotten the exhortation
119789 ^ that you as to sons addresses:

119800 ^ nor faint,
119802 ^ by him being reproved.
119805 ^ whom for he loves, [the] lord disciplines;

119819 ^ as sons you is treating - god;
119825 ^ what for son [is there]
119828 ^ whom not disciplines [his] father?
119832 ^ if however without you are
119836 ^ of discipline,
119837 ^ of which partakers they have become all,
119841 ^ then illegitimate children

119856 ^ and we respected [them];
119858 ^ not much and
119861 ^ more shall we be in subjection to the father - of spirits,
119867 ^ and shall live?
119869 ^ - truly indeed for a few days,
119875 ^ according to that seeming good to them, they were disciplining [us];
119880 ^ - but [he] for [our] benefitting,
119885 ^ in order - to share of the holiness of him.
119891 ^ all now

119894 ^ for indeed those being present, not seems

124287 ^ the son of me, - beloved of me, this is,
124295 ^ in whom i have found delight.”
124299 ^ and this - voice we heard

127793 ^ but having left the own dwelling, unto [the] judgment of [the] great day, in chains eternal under darkness he keeps,
127807 ^ just as sodom and gomorrah and the around them cities,
127816 ^ - in like manner with them having indulged in sexual immorality
127821 ^ and having gone after flesh strange, are set forth as an example

128035 ^ after - their own passions following,
128040 ^ - of ungodlinesses.
128042 ^ these are

128981 ^ i will give to him the manna
128985 ^ - having been hidden;
128987 ^ and i will give to him stone white,
128992 ^ and
128993 ^ on the stone a name new having been written,
128999 ^ which no one has known,
129002 ^ if not
129004 ^ the [one] receiving [it].
129006 ^ and to [the] messenger of the in thyatira church write:
129014 ^ these things says the son - of god,
129020 ^ the [one] having the eyes of him like a flame of fire,
129028 ^ and the feet of him like burnished bronze.
129034 ^ i know your - works, and - love, and - faith, and - service, and the perseverance of you;
129051 ^ and the works of you, the latter [are] greater than the first.
129060 ^ but i have against you
129064 ^ that you tolerate the woman jezebel,
129069 ^ the [one] calling herself a prophetess
129073 ^ and teaching
129075 ^ and misleading - my servants
129080 ^ to commit sexual immorality,
129081 ^ and to eat things sacrificed to idols.
129084 ^ and i have given her time
129088 ^ that she might repent,
129090 ^ and not she is willing
129093 ^ to repent of the sexual immorality of her.
129098 ^ behold,
129099 ^ i will cast her into a sickbed,
129103 ^ and
129104 ^ those committing adultery with her into tribulation great,
129111 ^ if not they shall repent of the deeds of her.
129118 ^ and the children of her i will kill with death,
129125 ^ and will know all the churches
129130 ^ that i am
129133 ^ the [one] searching affections and hearts;
129138 ^ and i will give of you to each according to the works of you.
129146 ^ to you however i say,
129149 ^ to [the] rest of those in thyatira,
129154 ^ as many as not have the teaching this,
129160 ^ who not have known the depths - of satan,
129167 ^ as they say:
129169 ^ not i will cast upon you any other burden.
129175 ^ but
129176 ^ to what you have, hold fast
129179 ^ until which [time] - i might come.
129183 ^ and
129184 ^ the [one] overcoming
129186 ^ and - keeping until [the] end the works of me, i will give to him authority over the nations,
129200 ^ and he will shepherd them with a rod of iron,
129206 ^ as the vessels [of] the potter are broken in pieces,
129212 ^ just as i also have received from the father of me.
129219 ^ and i will give to him the star - morning.
130306 ^ saying in a voice loud:
130309 ^ worthy is the lamb
130313 ^ - having been slain,
130908 ^ out of [the] tribe of judah twelve thousand having been sealed,
130914 ^ out of [the] tribe of reuben twelve thousand,
130919 ^ out of [the] tribe of gad twelve thousand,
130924 ^ out of [the] tribe of asher twelve thousand,
130929 ^ out of [the] tribe of naphtali twelve thousand,
130934 ^ out of [the] tribe of manasseh twelve thousand,
130939 ^ out of [the] tribe of simeon twelve thousand,

130949 ^ out of [the] tribe of isaachar twelve thousand,
130954 ^ out of [the] tribe of zebulun twelve thousand,
130959 ^ out of [the] tribe of joseph twelve thousand,
130964 ^ out of [the] tribe of benjamin twelve thousand having been sealed.
130970 ^ after these things i looked,
130973 ^ and behold,
130975 ^ a multitude great,
130977 ^ which
130978 ^ to number it no one was able, out of every nation, and tribes, and peoples, and tongues,
130991 ^ standing before the throne and before the lamb,
130999 ^ having been clothed with robes white,
131002 ^ and palm branches in the hands of them.
131008 ^ and they were crying out in a voice loud,
131012 ^ saying:
131013 ^ - salvation to the god of us,
131018 ^ the [one] sitting on the throne, and to the lamb!
131026 ^ and all the angels stood around the throne, and the elders, and the four living creatures,
131041 ^ and they fell before the throne upon the faces of them,
131050 ^ and worshiped - god,
131054 ^ saying,
131055 ^ amen!
131056 ^ - blessing, and - glory, and - wisdom, and - thanksgiving, and - honor, and - power, and - strength, to the god of us, to the ages of the ages! amen.
131085 ^ and answered one of the elders,
131091 ^ saying to me,
131093 ^ these
131094 ^ - having been clothed with the robes - white, who are they,
131102 ^ and from where have they come?
131105 ^ and i said to him,
131108 ^ lord of me, you know.
131112 ^ and he said to me,
131115 ^ these are
131117 ^ the [ones] coming out of the tribulation - great,
131124 ^ and they have washed the robes of them
131129 ^ and made white them in the blood of the lamb.
131137 ^ because of this, they are before the throne - of god,
131145 ^ and serve him day and night in the temple of him;
131155 ^ and
131156 ^ the [one] sitting on the throne will tabernacle over them.
131164 ^ not they will hunger any more,
131167 ^ neither will they thirst anymore,
131170 ^ nor at all shall fall upon them the sun,
131177 ^ nor any scorching heat;
131180 ^ because the lamb - in the center of the throne will shepherd them,
131190 ^ and he will lead them to living fountains
131196 ^ of waters,
131197 ^ and will wipe away - god every tear from the eyes of them.’
131207 ^ and when he opened the seal - seventh,
131214 ^ there was silence in - heaven for about half an hour.
131221 ^ and i saw the seven angels
131226 ^ who before - god stand,
131231 ^ and were given to them seven trumpets.
131236 ^ and another angel came
131240 ^ and stood at the altar,
131245 ^ having a censer golden;
131248 ^ and was given to him incense much,
131253 ^ that he will offer [it] with the prayers of the saints all upon the altar - golden - before the throne.
131269 ^ and went up the smoke of the incense with the prayers of the saints out of [the] hand of the angel, before - god.
131286 ^ and took the angel the censer,
131292 ^ and filled it from the fire of the altar,
131300 ^ and cast [it] to the earth;
131305 ^ and there were thunders, and rumblings, and flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.
131314 ^ and the seven angels
131318 ^ - having the seven trumpets prepared themselves
131325 ^ that they might sound the trumpets.
131327 ^ and the first sounded [his] trumpet,
131331 ^ and there was hail, and fire
131336 ^ having been mixed with blood,
131339 ^ and it was cast upon the earth.
131344 ^ and a third of the earth was burned up,
131350 ^ and a third of the trees were burned up,
131356 ^ and all [the] grass green was burned up.
131361 ^ and the second angel sounded [his] trumpet,
131366 ^ and [something] like a mountain great,
131370 ^ with fire burning, was cast into the sea.
131376 ^ and became a third of the sea blood,
131383 ^ and died a third of the creatures - in the sea
131393 ^ - having life,
131396 ^ and a third of the ships were destroyed.
131402 ^ and the third angel sounded [his] trumpet,
131407 ^ and fell out of - heaven a star great,
131414 ^ burning like a torch.
131417 ^ and it fell upon a third of the rivers, and upon the springs of waters.
131430 ^ and the name of the star is called - wormwood.
131438 ^ and became a third of the waters into wormwood,
131446 ^ and many of the men died from the waters,
131454 ^ because they were made bitter.
131456 ^ and the fourth angel sounded [his] trumpet,
131461 ^ and was struck a third of the sun, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars,
131477 ^ so that should be darkened a third of them,
131482 ^ and the day not should appear [for] a third of it,
131490 ^ and the night likewise.
131494 ^ and i looked,
131496 ^ and i heard one eagle
131500 ^ flying in mid-heaven,
131503 ^ saying in a voice loud,
131506 ^ woe! woe! woe
131509 ^ to those dwelling on the earth, because of the remaining voices of the trumpet of the three angels
131523 ^ - being about
131525 ^ to sound [their] trumpets!
131526 ^ and the fifth angel sounded [his] trumpet,
131531 ^ and i saw a star
131534 ^ out of - heaven having fallen to the earth,
131541 ^ and was given to it the key of the pit of the abyss.
131550 ^ and he opened the pit of the abyss,
131556 ^ and went up smoke out of the pit, like [the] smoke of a furnace great,
131566 ^ and were darkened the sun and the air by the smoke of the pit.
131578 ^ and out of the smoke came forth locusts unto the earth,
131587 ^ and was given to them power,
131591 ^ like have power the scorpions of the earth.
131598 ^ and it was said to them,
131601 ^ that not they shall harm the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree,
131614 ^ if not the men
131618 ^ - not having the seal - of god on the foreheads.
131628 ^ and it was granted to them
131631 ^ that not they should kill them,
131635 ^ but that they shall torment [them] months five.
131640 ^ and the torment of them [was] like torment of a scorpion,
131647 ^ when it might strike a man.
131650 ^ and in the days those, will seek - men - death,
131660 ^ and not no more will find it;
131665 ^ and they will long
131667 ^ to die,
131668 ^ and shall flee - death from them.
131674 ^ and the appearance of the locusts [was] like horses
131681 ^ having been prepared for battle,
131684 ^ and upon the heads of them [were something] like crowns, like gold;
131693 ^ and the faces of them like [the] faces of men.
131700 ^ and they had hair like hair of women,
131706 ^ and the teeth of them like [those] of lions were.
131713 ^ and they had breastplates like breastplates of iron,
131719 ^ and the sound of the wings of them [was] as [the] sound of chariots of horses many
131730 ^ rushing into battle.
131733 ^ and they have tails like scorpions and stingers,
131740 ^ and in the tails of them [is] the power of them
131748 ^ to injure - men for months five.
131753 ^ they have over them a king, the angel of the abyss.
131761 ^ [the] name of him in hebrew [is] abaddon,
131765 ^ and in the greek, [the] name he has apollyon.
131772 ^ - woe the first has passed.
131777 ^ behold,
131778 ^ are coming still two woes after these things.
131784 ^ and the sixth angel sounded [his] trumpet,
131789 ^ and i heard voice one
131793 ^ from the four horns of the altar - golden - before - god, saying to the sixth angel,
131809 ^ the [one] having the trumpet,
131813 ^ release the four angels,
131817 ^ those having been bound at the river - great euphrates.
131825 ^ and were released the four angels
131830 ^ - having been prepared for the hour and day and month and year,
131841 ^ so that they might kill a third - of mankind.
131847 ^ and the number of the armies of the cavalry [was] twice ten thousand ten thousands;
131856 ^ i heard the number of them.
131860 ^ and thus i saw the horses in the vision,
131868 ^ and
131869 ^ those sitting on them, having breastplates fiery and hyacinthine and brimstone.
131880 ^ and the heads of the horses [were] like heads of lions,
131888 ^ and out of the mouths of them proceed fire, and smoke, and brimstone.
131899 ^ by - three plagues these was killed a third of mankind, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone,
131918 ^ - proceeding out of the mouths of them.
131924 ^ the for
131926 ^ powers of the horses in the mouths of them are,
131934 ^ and in the tails of them;
131939 ^ the for
131941 ^ tails of them [are] like serpents,
131945 ^ having heads,
131947 ^ and with them they injure.
131951 ^ and the rest of the men
131956 ^ who not were killed by the plagues these not even repented of the works of the hands of them,
131971 ^ so that not they will worship the demons, and the idols - golden and - silver and - bronze and - stone and - wooden,
131993 ^ which
131994 ^ neither to see are able,
131997 ^ nor to hear,
131999 ^ nor to walk.
132001 ^ and not they repented of the murders of them, nor of the sorceries of them, nor of the sexual immorality of them, nor of the thefts of them.
132023 ^ and i saw another angel mighty
132028 ^ coming down out of - heaven,
132032 ^ clothed with a cloud,
132034 ^ and a rainbow upon the head of him,
132041 ^ and the face of him [was] like the sun,
132048 ^ and the feet of him like pillars of fire,
132055 ^ and
132056 ^ having in the hand of him a little scroll
132062 ^ being open.
132063 ^ and he placed the foot of him - right upon the sea,
132073 ^ the and
132075 ^ left upon the earth.
132079 ^ and he cried out in a voice loud
132083 ^ as a lion roars.
132086 ^ and when he cried out,
132089 ^ sounded the seven thunders, the of themselves voice.
132096 ^ and when had spoken the seven thunders,
132102 ^ i was about
132103 ^ to write.
132104 ^ but i heard a voice
132107 ^ out of - heaven, saying,
132111 ^ seal
132112 ^ what have spoken the seven thunders,
132117 ^ and not them write.
132121 ^ and the angel
132124 ^ whom i saw
132126 ^ standing on the sea and on the land lifted up the hand of him the right to - heaven,
132143 ^ and he swore
132145 ^ by the [one] living to the ages of the ages,
132153 ^ who created - heaven and the things in it, and the earth and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it
132175 ^ -, delay no longer will there be!
132179 ^ but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel,
132188 ^ when he is about
132190 ^ to sound [the] trumpet,
132191 ^ then would be completed the mystery - of god,
132197 ^ as proclaimed the of himself servants, the prophets.
132204 ^ and the voice
132207 ^ that i heard
132209 ^ out of - heaven again was speaking with me,
132216 ^ and saying,
132218 ^ go,
132219 ^ take the little scroll
132222 ^ - having been opened in the hand of the angel
132229 ^ - standing upon the sea, and upon the land.
132238 ^ and i went to the angel,
132243 ^ saying to him
132245 ^ give me the little scroll.
132249 ^ and he says to me,
132252 ^ take
132253 ^ and eat it;
132256 ^ and it will make bitter your - stomach,
132261 ^ but in the mouth of you it will be sweet as honey.”
132270 ^ and i took the little scroll out of the hand of the angel,
132279 ^ and i ate it;
132282 ^ and it was in the mouth of me as honey sweet;
132291 ^ and when i had eaten it,
132295 ^ was made bitter the stomach of me.
132299 ^ and they say to me,
132302 ^ it is necessary
132303 ^ for you again to prophesy concerning peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings many.
132315 ^ and was given to me a measuring rod like a staff,
132321 ^ saying,
132322 ^ rise
132323 ^ and measure the temple - of god, and the altar, and
132333 ^ those worshiping in it.
132337 ^ and the courtyard - outside the temple, leave out,
132346 ^ and not it measure,
132350 ^ because it has been given [up] to the nations,
132354 ^ and the city - holy they will trample upon months forty and two.
132364 ^ and i will grant to the two witnesses of me,
132370 ^ and they will prophesy days a thousand two hundred sixty,
132376 ^ clothed in sackcloth.
132378 ^ these are the two olive trees and the two lampstands
132387 ^ - before the lord of the earth
132393 ^ standing.
132394 ^ and if anyone
132397 ^ them should desire to harm,
132400 ^ fire goes out of the mouth of them
132406 ^ and devours the enemies of them.
132411 ^ and if anyone should desire
132415 ^ them to harm,
132417 ^ thus it is necessary
132419 ^ for him to be killed.
132421 ^ these have the power
132425 ^ to shut the sky,
132428 ^ so that no rain shall fall in the days of the prophecy of them;
132437 ^ and power they have over the waters,
132443 ^ to turn them into blood,
132447 ^ and to strike the earth with every plague,
132454 ^ as often as if they might desire.
132457 ^ and when they shall have completed the testimony of them,
132463 ^ the beast
132465 ^ - coming up out of the abyss will make with them war,
132474 ^ and will overcome them,
132477 ^ and will kill them.
132480 ^ and the body of them [will be] upon the street of city the great,
132491 ^ which is called figuratively sodom and egypt,
132497 ^ where also the lord of them was crucified.
132503 ^ and gaze [those] of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations upon the bodies of them, days three and a half,
132521 ^ and
132522 ^ the bodies of them not they will allow to be put into a tomb.
132530 ^ and
132531 ^ those dwelling on the earth rejoice over them
132539 ^ and make merry,
132541 ^ and gifts will send to one another,
132545 ^ because these - two prophets have tormented
132551 ^ those dwelling upon the earth.
132556 ^ and after the three days and a half, [the] spirit of life from - god entered into them,
132571 ^ and they stood upon the feet of them;
132577 ^ and fear great fell
132581 ^ upon those beholding them.
132585 ^ and they heard a voice great
132589 ^ out of - heaven, saying to them,
132594 ^ come up here.
132596 ^ and they went up to - heaven in the cloud;
132604 ^ and beheld them the enemies of them.
132610 ^ and in that - hour there was an earthquake great,
132618 ^ and a tenth of the city fell,
132624 ^ and were killed in the earthquake, names of men thousand seven.
132633 ^ and the rest terrified became
132638 ^ and gave glory to the god of heaven.
132645 ^ the woe - second has passed.
132650 ^ behold,
132651 ^ the woe - third is coming quickly.
132657 ^ and the seventh angel sounded [his] trumpet,
132662 ^ and there were voices great in - heaven,
132669 ^ saying:
132670 ^ has become the kingdom of the world, [that] of the lord of us, and of the christ of him,
132682 ^ and he will reign to the ages of the ages.
132689 ^ and the twenty four elders
132694 ^ - before - god
132698 ^ sitting on the thrones of them fell upon the faces of them
132708 ^ and worshiped - god,
132712 ^ saying:
132713 ^ we give thanks to you, lord - god - almighty,
132720 ^ the [one] being,
132722 ^ and who was,
132725 ^ that you have taken the power of you - great,
132732 ^ and have begun to reign.
132734 ^ and the nations were enraged,
132738 ^ and came the wrath of you,
132743 ^ and the time
132746 ^ for the dead to be judged,
132749 ^ and to give the reward to the servants of you, the prophets, and to the saints,
132761 ^ and to those fearing the name of you, the small and the great,
132772 ^ and to destroy
132774 ^ those who are destroying the earth.
132778 ^ and was opened the temple - of god - in - heaven,
132788 ^ and was seen the ark of the covenant of him in the temple of him.
132799 ^ and there were flashes of lightning, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and hail great.
132811 ^ and a sign great appeared in - heaven:
132818 ^ a woman
132819 ^ clothed with the sun,
132822 ^ and the moon under the feet of her,
132829 ^ and on the head of her a crown of stars twelve,
132837 ^ and
132838 ^ in womb having.
132841 ^ and she cries out,
132843 ^ being in travail,
132844 ^ and being in pain
132846 ^ to bring forth.
132847 ^ and was seen another sign in - heaven,
132854 ^ and behold,
132856 ^ a dragon great, red
132859 ^ having heads seven, and horns ten,
132865 ^ and upon the heads of him, seven royal crowns.
132872 ^ and the tail of him drags a third of the stars of heaven,
132883 ^ and he cast them to the earth.
132889 ^ and the dragon stands before the woman
132896 ^ - being about
132898 ^ to bring forth,
132899 ^ so that when she should bring forth, the child of her
132905 ^ he might devour.
132906 ^ and she brought forth a son male,
132910 ^ who is about
132912 ^ to rule all the nations with a rod of iron;
132919 ^ and was caught up the child of her to - god, and to the throne of him.
132932 ^ and the woman fled into the wilderness,
132939 ^ where she has there a place
132943 ^ having been prepared by - god,
132947 ^ so that there they should nourish her days one thousand two hundred sixty.
132955 ^ and there was war in - heaven:
132961 ^ - michael and the angels of him
132967 ^ - warred against the dragon,
132972 ^ and the dragon warred [back],
132976 ^ and the angels of him.
132980 ^ and not had he strength,
132983 ^ nor a place was found
132986 ^ for them any longer in - heaven.
132991 ^ and was thrown [out] the dragon - great,
