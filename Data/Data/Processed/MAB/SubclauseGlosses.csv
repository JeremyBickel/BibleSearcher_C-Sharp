1156 ^ by you
1158 ^ to be baptized,
1159 ^ and
1160 ^ you
1161 ^ come
1162 ^ to me?
1164 ^ answering,
1165 ^ however,
1166 ^ - jesus
1168 ^ said
1169 ^ unto him,
1171 ^ permit [it]
1172 ^ presently;
1173 ^ thus
1174 ^ for
1175 ^ fitting
1176 ^ it is
1177 ^ to us
1178 ^ to fulfill
1179 ^ all righteousness.
1181 ^ then
1182 ^ he permits
1183 ^ him.
1184 ^ having been baptized
1185 ^ now,
1186 ^ - jesus
1188 ^ immediately
1189 ^ went up
1190 ^ from the water;
1193 ^ and
1194 ^ behold,
1195 ^ were opened
1196 ^ to him
1197 ^ the heavens,
1199 ^ and
1200 ^ he saw
1201 ^ the spirit
1203 ^ of god
1205 ^ descending
1206 ^ as a dove,
1208 ^ and
1209 ^ alighting
1210 ^ upon him.
1212 ^ and
1213 ^ behold,
1214 ^ a voice
1215 ^ out of the heavens,
1218 ^ saying,
1219 ^ this
1220 ^ is
1221 ^ the son of me,
1224 ^ the beloved,
1226 ^ in whom
1228 ^ i was well pleased.
1229 ^ then
1230 ^ - jesus
1232 ^ was led up
1233 ^ into the wilderness
1236 ^ by the spirit
1239 ^ to be tempted
1240 ^ by the devil.
1243 ^ and
1244 ^ having fasted
1245 ^ days forty
1247 ^ and nights, forty
1250 ^ afterward
1251 ^ he was hungry.
1252 ^ and
1253 ^ having come
1254 ^ the [one] tempting,
1256 ^ he said
1257 ^ to him,
1258 ^ if

1260 ^ you are
1261 ^ - of god,
1263 ^ speak,
1264 ^ that
1265 ^ the stones these,
1268 ^ loaves of bread
1269 ^ might become.
1270 ^ -
1271 ^ but
1272 ^ answering,
1273 ^ he said,
1274 ^ it has been written:
1275 ^ not
1276 ^ by bread
1278 ^ alone
1279 ^ shall live
1280 ^ the man,
1282 ^ but
1283 ^ by every word

1287 ^ of [the] mouth of god.’
1290 ^ then
1291 ^ takes
1292 ^ him
1293 ^ the devil
1295 ^ to the holy city
1299 ^ and
1300 ^ sets
1301 ^ him
1302 ^ upon the pinnacle
1305 ^ of the temple,
1307 ^ and
1308 ^ says
1309 ^ to him,
1310 ^ if
1311 ^ son
1312 ^ you are
1313 ^ - of god,
1315 ^ throw
1316 ^ yourself
1317 ^ down;
1318 ^ it has been written
1319 ^ for
1320 ^ -:
1321 ^ to the angels of him
1324 ^ he will give orders
1325 ^ concerning you,
1327 ^ and
1328 ^ in [their] hands
1330 ^ will they bear up
1331 ^ you,
1332 ^ lest ever
1333 ^ you strike
1334 ^ against a stone
1336 ^ the foot of you.’
1339 ^ said
1340 ^ to him
1341 ^ - jesus,
1343 ^ again
1344 ^ it has been written:
1345 ^ not
1346 ^ you shall test
1347 ^ [the] lord
1348 ^ the god of you.’
1351 ^ again
1352 ^ takes
1353 ^ him
1354 ^ the devil
1356 ^ to a mountain
1358 ^ high exceedingly,
1360 ^ and
1361 ^ shows
1362 ^ to him
1363 ^ all the kingdoms
1366 ^ of the world
1368 ^ and the glory of them,
1372 ^ and
1373 ^ he says
1374 ^ to him,
1375 ^ these things
1376 ^ to you
1377 ^ all
1378 ^ will i give,
1379 ^ if
1380 ^ falling down,
1381 ^ you will worship
1382 ^ me.
1383 ^ then
1384 ^ says
1385 ^ to him
1386 ^ - jesus,
1388 ^ get you away,
1389 ^ satan;
1390 ^ it has been written
1391 ^ for:
1392 ^ [the] lord
1393 ^ the god of you,
1396 ^ you shall worship,
1397 ^ and
1398 ^ him
1399 ^ alone
1400 ^ shall you serve.’
1401 ^ then
1402 ^ leaves
1403 ^ him
1404 ^ the devil,
1406 ^ and
1407 ^ behold,
1408 ^ angels
1409 ^ came
1410 ^ and
1411 ^ were ministering
1412 ^ to him.
1413 ^ having heard
1414 ^ now
1415 ^ that
1416 ^ john
1417 ^ had been delivered up ,
1418 ^ he withdrew
1419 ^ into - galilee.
1422 ^ and
1423 ^ having left
1424 ^ - nazareth,
1426 ^ having come,
1427 ^ he dwelt
1428 ^ at capernaum,
1430 ^ which [is] on the sea-side
1432 ^ in [the] region
1434 ^ of zebulun
1435 ^ and naphtali,
1437 ^ that
1438 ^ it might be fulfilled
1439 ^ that having been spoken
1441 ^ by isaiah
1443 ^ the prophet,
1445 ^ saying:
1446 ^ land of zebulun
1448 ^ and land
1450 ^ of naphtali,
1451 ^ way
1452 ^ of [the] sea,
1453 ^ beyond the jordan,
1456 ^ galilee
1457 ^ of the gentiles —

1514 ^ a net
1515 ^ into the sea;
1518 ^ they were
1519 ^ for

1521 ^ and
1522 ^ he says
1523 ^ to them,

1538 ^ they followed
1539 ^ him.
1540 ^ and

1559 ^ with zebedee
1561 ^ the father of them,
1564 ^ mending
1565 ^ the nets of them;
1568 ^ and
1569 ^ he called
1570 ^ them.
1571 ^ -
1572 ^ and
1573 ^ immediately,
1574 ^ having left
1575 ^ the boat
1577 ^ and the father of them,
1581 ^ they followed
1582 ^ him.
1583 ^ and

3263 ^ or
3264 ^ which
3265 ^ is
3266 ^ of you a man
3269 ^ whom
3270 ^ will ask for
3271 ^ the son of him
3274 ^ bread,
3275 ^ not
3276 ^ a stone
3277 ^ will he give
3278 ^ him?
3279 ^ or
3280 ^ also
3281 ^ a fish
3282 ^ he will ask for,
3283 ^ not
3284 ^ a serpent
3285 ^ will he give
3286 ^ him?
3287 ^ if
3288 ^ therefore
3289 ^ you,
3290 ^ evil
3291 ^ being,
3292 ^ know
3293 ^ gifts good
3295 ^ to give
3296 ^ to the children of you,
3299 ^ how much more
3301 ^ the father of you
3304 ^ who [is]
3305 ^ in the heavens
3308 ^ will give
3309 ^ good things
3310 ^ to those asking
3312 ^ him!
3313 ^ all things
3314 ^ therefore,
3315 ^ as many as
3316 ^ if
3317 ^ you might desire
3318 ^ that
3319 ^ should do
3320 ^ to you
3321 ^ the men,
3323 ^ so
3324 ^ also
3325 ^ you
3326 ^ do
3327 ^ to them.
3328 ^ this
3329 ^ for
3330 ^ is
3331 ^ the law
3333 ^ and the prophets.
3336 ^ enter
3337 ^ through the narrow gate.
3341 ^ for
3342 ^ wide [is]
3343 ^ the gate
3345 ^ and
3346 ^ broad
3347 ^ the way
3349 ^ - leading
3351 ^ to - destruction,
3354 ^ and
3355 ^ many
3356 ^ are
3357 ^ those entering
3359 ^ through it.
3361 ^ for
3362 ^ small [is]
3363 ^ the gate
3365 ^ and
3366 ^ compressed
3367 ^ the way

3374 ^ and
3375 ^ few
3376 ^ are
3377 ^ those finding
3379 ^ it.
3380 ^ but beware
3381 ^ of the false prophets,
3384 ^ who
3385 ^ come
3386 ^ to you
3388 ^ in clothing of sheep;
3391 ^ inwardly
3392 ^ however
3393 ^ they are
3394 ^ wolves ravenous.
3396 ^ by the fruits of them
3400 ^ you will know
3401 ^ them.
3402 ^ not
3403 ^ do they gather
3404 ^ from thorns
3406 ^ grapes,
3407 ^ or
3408 ^ from thistles
3410 ^ figs?
3411 ^ so
3412 ^ every tree good,
3415 ^ fruits good
3417 ^ produces;
3418 ^ -
3419 ^ but
3420 ^ the bad tree,
3422 ^ fruits bad
3424 ^ produces.
3425 ^ not
3426 ^ is able
3427 ^ a tree good,
3429 ^ fruits bad
3431 ^ to produce;
3432 ^ nor
3433 ^ a tree bad,
3435 ^ fruits good
3437 ^ to produce.
3438 ^ every tree
3440 ^ not
3441 ^ producing
3442 ^ fruit good
3444 ^ is cut down
3445 ^ and
3446 ^ into fire
3448 ^ is thrown.
3449 ^ then surely
3450 ^ by the fruits of them
3454 ^ you will know
3455 ^ them.
3456 ^ not everyone
3458 ^ - saying
3460 ^ to me,
3461 ^ lord,

3472 ^ the will
3474 ^ the father of me,
3477 ^ who [is]

3481 ^ many
3482 ^ will say
3483 ^ to me
3484 ^ in that the day,
3488 ^ lord,
3489 ^ lord,
3490 ^ not
3491 ^ in your name
3494 ^ did we prophesy,
3495 ^ and
3496 ^ [in] your name
3499 ^ demons
3500 ^ cast out,
3501 ^ and
3502 ^ [in] your name
3505 ^ miracles many
3507 ^ perform?
3508 ^ and
3509 ^ then
3510 ^ i will declare
3511 ^ to them
3512 ^ -,
3513 ^ never
3514 ^ knew i
3515 ^ you;
3516 ^ depart you
3517 ^ from me,
3519 ^ those working
3521 ^ - lawlessness.
3523 ^ everyone
3524 ^ therefore,

3526 ^ hears
3527 ^ my - words these,
3531 ^ and
3532 ^ does
3533 ^ them,
3534 ^ will be like
3535 ^ a man wise,
3537 ^ who
3538 ^ built
3539 ^ his - house
3542 ^ upon the rock.
3545 ^ and
3546 ^ came down
3547 ^ the rain,
3549 ^ and
3550 ^ came
3551 ^ the torrents,
3553 ^ and
3554 ^ blew
3555 ^ the winds,
3557 ^ and
3558 ^ beat
3559 ^ that house upon;
3562 ^ and
3563 ^ not
3564 ^ it fell,
3565 ^ it had been founded
3566 ^ for
3567 ^ upon the rock.
3570 ^ and
3571 ^ everyone
3572 ^ - hearing
3574 ^ my - words these,
3578 ^ and
3579 ^ not
3580 ^ doing
3581 ^ them,
3582 ^ he will be likened
3583 ^ to a man foolish,
3585 ^ who
3586 ^ built
3587 ^ of him the house
3590 ^ upon the sand.
3593 ^ and
3594 ^ came down
3595 ^ the rain,

3605 ^ and
3606 ^ beat
3607 ^ that house upon,
3610 ^ and
3611 ^ it fell —
3612 ^ and
3613 ^ was
3614 ^ the fall of it
3617 ^ great.
3618 ^ and
3619 ^ it came to pass,
3620 ^ when
3621 ^ had finished
3622 ^ - jesus
3624 ^ the words these,
3627 ^ were astonished
3628 ^ the crowds
3630 ^ at the teaching of him.
3634 ^ he was
3635 ^ for
3636 ^ teaching
3637 ^ them
3638 ^ as
3639 ^ authority
3640 ^ having,
3641 ^ and
3642 ^ not
3643 ^ as
3644 ^ the scribes of them.
3647 ^ having come down
3648 ^ now
3649 ^ he
3650 ^ from the mountain,
3653 ^ followed
3654 ^ him
3655 ^ crowds great.
3657 ^ and
3658 ^ behold,
3659 ^ a leper
3660 ^ having come,
3661 ^ was worshipping
3662 ^ him,
3663 ^ saying,
3664 ^ lord,
3665 ^ if
3666 ^ you are willing,
3667 ^ you are able
3668 ^ me
3669 ^ to cleanse.
3670 ^ and
3671 ^ having stretched out
3672 ^ the hand,
3674 ^ he touched
3675 ^ him,
3676 ^ saying,
3677 ^ i am willing;
3678 ^ be you cleansed!
3679 ^ and
3680 ^ immediately
3681 ^ was cleansed
3682 ^ his - leprosy.
3685 ^ and
3686 ^ says
3687 ^ to him
3688 ^ - jesus,
3690 ^ see that
3691 ^ no one
3692 ^ you tell.
3693 ^ but
3694 ^ go,
3695 ^ yourself
3696 ^ show
3697 ^ to the priest,
3699 ^ and
3700 ^ offer
3701 ^ the gift
3703 ^ that
3704 ^ commanded
3705 ^ moses,
3706 ^ for a testimony to them.
3709 ^ having entered
3710 ^ now
3711 ^ he
3712 ^ into capernaum,
3714 ^ came
3715 ^ to him
3716 ^ a centurion,
3717 ^ imploring
3718 ^ him,
3719 ^ and
3720 ^ saying,
3721 ^ lord,
3722 ^ the servant of me
3725 ^ is lying
3726 ^ in the house,
3729 ^ paralyzed,
3730 ^ grievously
3731 ^ tormented.
3732 ^ and
3733 ^ he says
3734 ^ to him,
3735 ^ i
3736 ^ having come,
3737 ^ will heal
3738 ^ him.
3739 ^ and
3740 ^ answering
3741 ^ the centurion
3743 ^ said,
3744 ^ lord,
3745 ^ not
3746 ^ i am
3747 ^ worthy
3748 ^ that
3749 ^ of me under the roof
3753 ^ you should come;
3754 ^ but
3755 ^ only
3756 ^ speak
3757 ^ the word,
3758 ^ and
3759 ^ will be healed
3760 ^ the servant of me.
3763 ^ also
3764 ^ for
3765 ^ i
3766 ^ a man
3767 ^ am
3768 ^ under authority,
3770 ^ having
3771 ^ under me
3773 ^ soldiers;
3774 ^ and
3775 ^ i say
3776 ^ to this [one],
3777 ^ go,
3778 ^ and
3779 ^ he goes;
3780 ^ and
3781 ^ to another,
3782 ^ come,
3783 ^ and
3784 ^ he comes;
3785 ^ and
3786 ^ to [the] servant of me,
3789 ^ do
3790 ^ this,
3791 ^ and
3792 ^ he does [it].
3793 ^ having heard
3794 ^ now,
3795 ^ - jesus
3797 ^ marveled,
3798 ^ and
3799 ^ said
3800 ^ to those following,
3802 ^ truly
3803 ^ i say
3804 ^ to you,
3805 ^ except no one
3807 ^ so great faith
3809 ^ in - israel
3812 ^ have i found.
3813 ^ i say
3814 ^ now
3815 ^ to you
3816 ^ that
3817 ^ many
3818 ^ from east
3820 ^ and west
3822 ^ will come,
3823 ^ and
3824 ^ will recline
3825 ^ with abraham
3827 ^ and isaac
3829 ^ and jacob
3831 ^ in the kingdom
3834 ^ of the heavens;
3836 ^ the
3837 ^ however
3838 ^ sons
3839 ^ of the kingdom
3841 ^ will be cast out,
3842 ^ into the darkness
3845 ^ the outer,
3847 ^ there
3848 ^ will be
3849 ^ the weeping
3851 ^ and the gnashing
3854 ^ of the teeth.
3856 ^ and
3857 ^ said
3858 ^ - jesus
3860 ^ to the centurion,
3862 ^ go,
3863 ^ as
3864 ^ you have believed,
3865 ^ be it
3866 ^ to you.
3867 ^ and
3868 ^ was healed
3869 ^ the servant of him
3872 ^ in the hour that.
3876 ^ and
3877 ^ having come
3878 ^ - jesus
3880 ^ to the house of peter,
3884 ^ he saw
3885 ^ the mother-in-law of him
3888 ^ lying sick
3889 ^ and
3890 ^ fevering.
3891 ^ and
3892 ^ he touched
3893 ^ the hand of her,
3896 ^ and
3897 ^ left
3898 ^ her
3899 ^ the fever;
3901 ^ and
3902 ^ she arose
3903 ^ and
3904 ^ was ministering
3905 ^ to them.
3906 ^ evening
3907 ^ now
3908 ^ having come,
3909 ^ they brought
3910 ^ to him
3911 ^ being possessed with demons many,
3913 ^ and
3914 ^ he cast out
3915 ^ the spirits
3917 ^ by a word,
3918 ^ and
3919 ^ all
3920 ^ those
3921 ^ sick
3922 ^ being,
3923 ^ he healed,
3924 ^ so that
3925 ^ it might be fulfilled
3926 ^ that having been spoken
3928 ^ by isaiah
3930 ^ the prophet,
3932 ^ saying,
3933 ^ himself
3934 ^ the infirmities of us
3937 ^ he took,
3938 ^ and
3939 ^ our diseases
3941 ^ bore.”
3942 ^ having seen
3943 ^ now
3944 ^ - jesus
3946 ^ a crowd
3947 ^ around him,
3949 ^ he commanded
3950 ^ to depart
3951 ^ to the other side.
3954 ^ and
3955 ^ having come to [him],
3956 ^ one scribe
3958 ^ said
3959 ^ to him,
3960 ^ teacher,
3961 ^ i will follow
3962 ^ you
3963 ^ wherever
3964 ^ if
3965 ^ you might go.
3966 ^ and
3967 ^ says
3968 ^ to him
3969 ^ - jesus,
3971 ^ - foxes
3973 ^ holes
3974 ^ have,
3975 ^ and
3976 ^ the birds
3978 ^ of the air
3980 ^ nests;
3981 ^ -
3982 ^ but
3983 ^ the son
3984 ^ - of man,
3986 ^ no
3987 ^ has
3988 ^ [place] where
3989 ^ the head
3991 ^ he might lay.
3992 ^ another
3993 ^ now
3994 ^ of the disciples of him
3997 ^ said
3998 ^ to him,
3999 ^ lord,
4000 ^ allow
4001 ^ me
4002 ^ first
4003 ^ to go
4004 ^ and
4005 ^ to bury
4006 ^ the father of me.
4009 ^ -
4010 ^ but
4011 ^ jesus
4012 ^ said
4013 ^ to him,
4014 ^ follow
4015 ^ me,
4016 ^ and
4017 ^ leave
4018 ^ the dead
4020 ^ to bury
4021 ^ - their own dead.
4024 ^ and
4025 ^ having entered
4026 ^ he
4027 ^ into the boat,
4030 ^ followed
4031 ^ him
4032 ^ the disciples of him.
4035 ^ and
4036 ^ behold,
4037 ^ a storm great
4039 ^ arose
4040 ^ in the sea,
4043 ^ so that
4044 ^ the boat
4046 ^ was being swamped
4047 ^ by the waves;
4050 ^ he himself
4051 ^ however
4052 ^ was sleeping.
4053 ^ and
4054 ^ having come to [him],
4055 ^ they awoke
4056 ^ him,
4057 ^ saying,
4058 ^ lord,
4059 ^ save us,
4060 ^ we are perishing!
4061 ^ and
4062 ^ he says
4063 ^ to them,
4064 ^ why
4065 ^ fearful
4066 ^ are you,
4067 ^ o [you] of little faith?
4068 ^ then,
4069 ^ having arisen,
4070 ^ he rebuked
4071 ^ the winds
4073 ^ and the sea,
4076 ^ and
4077 ^ there was
4078 ^ a calm great.
4080 ^ -
4081 ^ and
4082 ^ the men
4083 ^ marveled,
4084 ^ saying,
4085 ^ what kind [of man]
4086 ^ is
4087 ^ this,
4088 ^ that
4089 ^ even
4090 ^ the winds
4092 ^ and the sea
4095 ^ him
4096 ^ obey?
4097 ^ and
4098 ^ having come
4099 ^ he
4100 ^ to the other side,
4103 ^ to the region
4106 ^ of the gadarenes,
4108 ^ met
4109 ^ him
4110 ^ two
4111 ^ being possessed by demons,
4112 ^ out of the tombs
4115 ^ coming forth,
4116 ^ violent extremely,
4118 ^ so that
4119 ^ not
4120 ^ was able
4121 ^ anyone
4122 ^ to pass
4123 ^ by the way that.
4127 ^ and
4128 ^ behold,
4129 ^ they cried out,
4130 ^ saying,
4131 ^ what
4132 ^ to us
4133 ^ and to you,
4135 ^ son
4136 ^ - of god?
4138 ^ are you come
4139 ^ here
4140 ^ before [the] time
4142 ^ to torment
4143 ^ us?
4144 ^ there was
4145 ^ now
4146 ^ far off
4147 ^ from them
4149 ^ a herd
4150 ^ of pigs many,
4152 ^ feeding.
4153 ^ -
4154 ^ and
4155 ^ the demons
4156 ^ were begging
4157 ^ him,
4158 ^ saying,
4159 ^ if
4160 ^ you cast out
4161 ^ us,
4162 ^ send away
4163 ^ us
4164 ^ into the herd
4167 ^ - of pigs.
4169 ^ and
4170 ^ he said
4171 ^ to them,
4172 ^ go.
4173 ^ -
4174 ^ and
4175 ^ having gone out
4176 ^ they went away
4177 ^ into the pigs;
4180 ^ and
4181 ^ behold,
4182 ^ rushed
4183 ^ all the herd
4186 ^ down the steep bank
4189 ^ into the sea,
4192 ^ and
4193 ^ perished
4194 ^ in the waters.
4197 ^ those
4198 ^ now
4199 ^ feeding [them]
4200 ^ fled,
4201 ^ and
4202 ^ having gone away
4203 ^ into the city,
4206 ^ they related
4207 ^ everything,
4208 ^ including the [matter]
4210 ^ of those being possessed by demons.
4212 ^ and
4213 ^ behold,
4214 ^ all the city
4217 ^ went out
4218 ^ to meet
4220 ^ - jesus.
4222 ^ and
4223 ^ having seen
4224 ^ him,
4225 ^ they begged [him]
4226 ^ that
4227 ^ he would depart
4228 ^ from the region of them.
4232 ^ and
4233 ^ having entered
4234 ^ into a boat,
4236 ^ he passed over
4237 ^ and
4238 ^ came
4239 ^ to the own city.
4243 ^ and
4244 ^ behold,
4245 ^ they were bringing
4246 ^ to him
4247 ^ a paralytic
4248 ^ on a bed
4250 ^ lying.
4251 ^ and
4252 ^ having seen
4253 ^ - jesus
4255 ^ the faith of them,
4258 ^ he said
4259 ^ to the paralytic,
4261 ^ take courage,
4262 ^ son;
4263 ^ have been forgiven
4264 ^ of you the sins.
4267 ^ and
4268 ^ behold,
4269 ^ some
4270 ^ of the scribes
4272 ^ said
4273 ^ to themselves,
4275 ^ this [man]
4276 ^ blasphemes!
4277 ^ and
4278 ^ having known
4279 ^ - jesus
4281 ^ the thoughts of them,
4284 ^ he said,
4285 ^ so that why
4286 ^ think you
4287 ^ evil
4288 ^ in the hearts of you?
4292 ^ which
4293 ^ for
4294 ^ is

4454 ^ the disciples of john,
4457 ^ saying,
4458 ^ because of why
4460 ^ we

4662 ^ the girl,
4664 ^ but

4705 ^ have mercy on
4706 ^ us,
4707 ^ son of david.
4709 ^ having come
4710 ^ now
4711 ^ into the house,
4714 ^ came
4715 ^ to him
4716 ^ the blind [men],

4754 ^ saying,
4755 ^ see that
4756 ^ no one
4757 ^ knows.
4758 ^ -
4759 ^ but
4760 ^ having gone out,
4761 ^ they make known
4762 ^ him
4763 ^ in all the land that.
4768 ^ [as] they
4769 ^ now
4770 ^ were going out,
4771 ^ behold,
4772 ^ they brought
4773 ^ to him
4774 ^ a man
4775 ^ mute,
4776 ^ possessed by a demon.
4777 ^ and
4778 ^ having been cast out
4779 ^ the demon,
4781 ^ spoke
4782 ^ the mute [man].
4784 ^ and
4785 ^ marveled
4786 ^ the crowds,
4788 ^ saying,
4789 ^ never

4791 ^ thus
4792 ^ in - israel.
4795 ^ the
4796 ^ now

4830 ^ every disease
4832 ^ and every sickness.
4835 ^ having seen
4836 ^ now
4837 ^ the crowds,
4839 ^ he was moved with compassion
4840 ^ for them,
4842 ^ because
4843 ^ they were
4844 ^ wearied
4845 ^ and
4846 ^ cast away,
4847 ^ as
4848 ^ sheep
4849 ^ not
4850 ^ having
4851 ^ a shepherd.
4852 ^ then
4853 ^ he says
4854 ^ to the disciples of him,
4857 ^ the
4858 ^ indeed
4859 ^ harvest

5731 ^ i say
5732 ^ to you,
5733 ^ and [one]
5734 ^ more excellent than a prophet.
5736 ^ for this
5737 ^ is [he]
5738 ^ concerning whom
5740 ^ it has been written:
5741 ^ behold,
5742 ^ i
5743 ^ send
5744 ^ the messenger of me

5758 ^ i say
5759 ^ to you,
5760 ^ not
5761 ^ there has risen
5762 ^ among [those] born of women
5765 ^ one greater
5766 ^ than john

5769 ^ -
5770 ^ yet
5771 ^ the least
5772 ^ in the kingdom
5775 ^ of the heavens,
5777 ^ greater than he
5779 ^ is.
5780 ^ from
5781 ^ then
5782 ^ the days
5784 ^ of john
5785 ^ the baptist
5787 ^ until now,
5789 ^ the kingdom
5791 ^ of the heavens
5793 ^ is taken by violence,
5794 ^ and [the]
5795 ^ violent
5796 ^ claim
5797 ^ it.
5798 ^ all
5799 ^ for
5800 ^ the prophets
5802 ^ and the law
5805 ^ until john
5807 ^ prophesied.
5808 ^ and
5809 ^ if
5810 ^ you are willing
5811 ^ to receive [it],
5812 ^ he
5813 ^ is
5814 ^ elijah,
5815 ^ the one being about
5817 ^ to come.
5818 ^ the [one] having
5820 ^ ears,
5821 ^ let him hear!
5822 ^ to what
5823 ^ however
5824 ^ will i compare
5825 ^ the generation this?
5828 ^ like
5829 ^ it is
5830 ^ little children
5831 ^ sitting
5832 ^ in the markets,
5835 ^ and
5836 ^ calling out
5837 ^ - to others,
5839 ^ saying:
5840 ^ we piped
5841 ^ for you,
5842 ^ and
5843 ^ not
5844 ^ you did dance;
5845 ^ we sang a dirge
5846 ^ and
5847 ^ not
5848 ^ you did wail.
5849 ^ came
5850 ^ for
5851 ^ john
5852 ^ neither
5853 ^ eating
5854 ^ nor
5855 ^ drinking,
5856 ^ and
5857 ^ they say,
5858 ^ a demon
5859 ^ he has!
5860 ^ came
5861 ^ the son
5863 ^ - of man
5865 ^ eating
5866 ^ and
5867 ^ drinking,
5868 ^ and
5869 ^ they say,
5870 ^ behold,
5871 ^ a man,
5872 ^ a glutton
5873 ^ and a drunkard,
5875 ^ of tax collectors a friend
5877 ^ and of sinners!
5879 ^ but
5880 ^ is justified
5881 ^ - wisdom
5883 ^ by the deeds of her.
5887 ^ then
5888 ^ he began
5889 ^ to denounce
5890 ^ the cities
5892 ^ in which
5894 ^ had taken place
5895 ^ the most miracles of him,
5899 ^ because
5900 ^ not
5901 ^ they repented.
5902 ^ woe
5903 ^ to you,
5904 ^ chorazin!
5905 ^ woe
5906 ^ to you,
5907 ^ bethsaida!
5908 ^ for
5909 ^ if
5910 ^ in tyre
5912 ^ and sidon
5914 ^ had taken place
5915 ^ the miracles
5917 ^ - having come to pass
5919 ^ in you,
5921 ^ long ago
5922 ^ then
5923 ^ in sackcloth
5925 ^ and ashes
5927 ^ they would have repented.
5928 ^ but
5929 ^ i say
5930 ^ to you,
5931 ^ for tyre
5932 ^ and sidon more tolerable
5935 ^ will it be
5936 ^ in [the] day of judgment
5939 ^ than
5940 ^ for you.
5941 ^ and
5942 ^ you,
5943 ^ capernaum,
5944 ^ not
5945 ^ to heaven
5947 ^ will be exalted,
5948 ^ to hades
5950 ^ will be brought down!
5951 ^ for
5952 ^ if
5953 ^ in sodom
5955 ^ had taken place
5956 ^ the miracles
5958 ^ - having taken place
5960 ^ in you,
5962 ^ it would have remained
5963 ^ -
5964 ^ until the day.
5967 ^ but
5968 ^ i say
5969 ^ to you,
5970 ^ that
5971 ^ for [the] land of sodom more tolerable
5974 ^ will it be
5975 ^ in day of judgment
5978 ^ than
5979 ^ for you.
5980 ^ at that - time
5984 ^ answering,
5985 ^ - jesus
5987 ^ said,
5988 ^ i fully consent
5989 ^ to you,
5990 ^ father,
5991 ^ lord
5992 ^ of the heaven
5994 ^ and the earth,
5997 ^ that
5998 ^ you did hide
5999 ^ these things
6000 ^ from wise
6002 ^ and learned,
6004 ^ and
6005 ^ did reveal
6006 ^ them
6007 ^ to little children.
6008 ^ yes,
6009 ^ - father,
6011 ^ for
6012 ^ thus
6013 ^ well-pleasing
6014 ^ it was
6015 ^ before you.
6017 ^ all things
6018 ^ to me
6019 ^ have been delivered
6020 ^ by the father of me.
6024 ^ and
6025 ^ no one
6026 ^ knows
6027 ^ the son,
6029 ^ if
6030 ^ not
6031 ^ the father;
6033 ^ nor
6034 ^ the father
6036 ^ anyone
6037 ^ does know,
6038 ^ if
6039 ^ not
6040 ^ the son,
6042 ^ and
6043 ^ to whom
6044 ^ if
6045 ^ might choose
6046 ^ the son
6048 ^ to reveal [him].
6049 ^ come
6050 ^ to me,
6052 ^ all
6053 ^ those toiling
6055 ^ and
6056 ^ being burdened,
6057 ^ and i
6058 ^ will give rest
6059 ^ to you.
6060 ^ take
6061 ^ the yoke of me
6064 ^ upon you
6066 ^ and
6067 ^ learn
6068 ^ from me,
6070 ^ for
6071 ^ gentle
6072 ^ i am
6073 ^ and humble
6075 ^ [in] the heart,
6077 ^ and
6078 ^ you will find
6079 ^ rest
6080 ^ [for] the souls of you.
6083 ^ the
6084 ^ for
6085 ^ yoke of me
6087 ^ [is] easy,
6088 ^ and
6089 ^ the burden of me
6092 ^ light
6093 ^ is.
6094 ^ at that - time
6098 ^ went
6099 ^ - jesus
6101 ^ on the sabbaths
6103 ^ through the grainfields,
6106 ^ -
6107 ^ and
6108 ^ the disciples of him
6110 ^ were hungry,
6111 ^ and
6112 ^ they began
6113 ^ to pluck [the]
6114 ^ heads of grain
6115 ^ and
6116 ^ to eat.
6117 ^ -
6118 ^ and
6119 ^ the pharisees,
6120 ^ having seen,
6121 ^ said
6122 ^ to him,
6123 ^ behold,
6124 ^ the disciples of you
6127 ^ are doing
6128 ^ what
6129 ^ not
6130 ^ it is lawful
6131 ^ to do
6132 ^ on sabbath.
6134 ^ -
6135 ^ and
6136 ^ he said
6137 ^ to them,
6138 ^ not
6139 ^ you have read
6140 ^ what
6141 ^ did
6142 ^ david
6143 ^ when
6144 ^ he was hungry,
6145 ^ and
6146 ^ those
6147 ^ with him —
6149 ^ how
6150 ^ he entered
6151 ^ into the house
6154 ^ - of god,
6156 ^ and
6157 ^ the loaves
6159 ^ of the presentation
6161 ^ they ate,
6162 ^ which
6163 ^ not
6164 ^ lawful
6165 ^ it was
6166 ^ for him
6167 ^ to eat,
6168 ^ nor
6169 ^ for those
6170 ^ with him,
6172 ^ if
6173 ^ not
6174 ^ for the priests
6176 ^ only?
6177 ^ or
6178 ^ not
6179 ^ have you read
6180 ^ in the law,
6183 ^ that
6184 ^ on the sabbath
6186 ^ the priests
6188 ^ in the temple
6191 ^ the sabbath
6193 ^ profane,
6194 ^ and
6195 ^ guiltless
6196 ^ are?
6197 ^ i say
6198 ^ however
6199 ^ to you
6200 ^ that
6201 ^ the temple a greater than
6204 ^ is
6205 ^ here.
6206 ^ if
6207 ^ however
6208 ^ you had known
6209 ^ what
6210 ^ is,
6211 ^ mercy
6212 ^ i desire
6213 ^ and
6214 ^ not
6215 ^ sacrifice,’
6216 ^ not
6217 ^ -
6218 ^ you would have condemned
6219 ^ the guiltless.
6221 ^ lord
6222 ^ for
6223 ^ is
6224 ^ of the sabbath
6226 ^ the son
6228 ^ of man.
6230 ^ and
6231 ^ having departed
6232 ^ from there,
6233 ^ he went
6234 ^ into the synagogue of them.
6238 ^ and
6239 ^ behold,
6240 ^ a man
6241 ^ a hand
6242 ^ having
6243 ^ withered.
6244 ^ and
6245 ^ they asked
6246 ^ him,
6247 ^ saying,
6248 ^ is
6249 ^ it lawful
6250 ^ on the sabbaths
6252 ^ to heal?
6253 ^ so that
6254 ^ they might accuse
6255 ^ him.
6256 ^ -
6257 ^ and
6258 ^ he said
6259 ^ to them,
6260 ^ what
6261 ^ will there be
6262 ^ among you
6264 ^ man,
6265 ^ who
6266 ^ will have
6267 ^ sheep one,
6269 ^ and
6270 ^ if
6271 ^ falls
6272 ^ it
6273 ^ on the sabbaths
6275 ^ into a pit,
6277 ^ not
6278 ^ will he take hold of
6279 ^ it
6280 ^ and
6281 ^ will raise [it] up?
6282 ^ how much
6283 ^ therefore
6284 ^ is more valuable
6285 ^ a man
6286 ^ than a sheep!
6287 ^ therefore
6288 ^ it is lawful
6289 ^ on the sabbaths
6291 ^ good
6292 ^ to do.
6293 ^ then
6294 ^ he says
6295 ^ to [the] man,
6297 ^ stretch out
6298 ^ your - hand.
6301 ^ and
6302 ^ he stretched [it] out,
6303 ^ and
6304 ^ it was restored,
6305 ^ sound
6306 ^ as the other.
6309 ^ having gone out
6310 ^ now,
6311 ^ the pharisees
6313 ^ a counsel
6314 ^ held
6315 ^ against him,
6317 ^ how
6318 ^ him
6319 ^ they might destroy.
6320 ^ -
6321 ^ and
6322 ^ jesus,
6323 ^ having known,
6324 ^ withdrew
6325 ^ from there.
6326 ^ and
6327 ^ followed
6328 ^ him
6329 ^ multitudes great,
6331 ^ and
6332 ^ he healed
6333 ^ them all,
6335 ^ and
6336 ^ he warned
6337 ^ them
6338 ^ that
6339 ^ not
6340 ^ known
6341 ^ him

6780 ^ in the heart
6783 ^ of the earth
6785 ^ three days

6790 ^ the men of nineveh
6792 ^ will stand up
6793 ^ in the judgment
6796 ^ with the generation this,
6800 ^ and
6801 ^ will condemn
6802 ^ it;
6803 ^ for
6804 ^ they repented
6805 ^ at the preaching of jonah;
6809 ^ and
6810 ^ behold,
6811 ^ greater than jonah
6813 ^ here.
6814 ^ the queen of [the] south
6816 ^ will rise up
6817 ^ in the judgment
6820 ^ with the generation this,

6842 ^ here.
6843 ^ when
6844 ^ now
6845 ^ the unclean spirit
6848 ^ is gone out
6849 ^ from the man,
6852 ^ it passes
6853 ^ through waterless places
6856 ^ seeking
6857 ^ rest,
6858 ^ and
6859 ^ none
6860 ^ finds [it].
6861 ^ then
6862 ^ it says,
6863 ^ to the house of me
6867 ^ i will return,
6868 ^ from where
6869 ^ i came out.
6870 ^ and
6871 ^ having come,
6872 ^ it finds [it]
6873 ^ being unoccupied,
6874 ^ swept,
6875 ^ and
6876 ^ put in order.
6877 ^ then
6878 ^ it goes
6879 ^ and
6880 ^ takes
6881 ^ with itself
6883 ^ seven other spirits
6886 ^ more evil than itself,
6888 ^ and
6889 ^ having entered in
6890 ^ they dwell
6891 ^ there;
6892 ^ and
6893 ^ becomes
6894 ^ the last
6896 ^ of the man that
6899 ^ worse
6900 ^ than the first.
6902 ^ so
6903 ^ it will be
6904 ^ also
6905 ^ unto generation
6907 ^ this
6908 ^ the evil.
6910 ^ while
6911 ^ he
6912 ^ was speaking
6913 ^ to the crowds,
6915 ^ behold,
6916 ^ the mother
6918 ^ and the brothers of him
6922 ^ were standing
6923 ^ outside,
6924 ^ seeking
6925 ^ to him
6926 ^ to speak.
6927 ^ said
6928 ^ now

6942 ^ to you
6943 ^ to speak.
6944 ^ -
6945 ^ and
6946 ^ answering,
6947 ^ he said
6948 ^ to the [one] telling
6950 ^ him,
6951 ^ who
6952 ^ is
6953 ^ the mother of me,
6956 ^ and
6957 ^ who
6958 ^ are
6959 ^ the brothers of me?
6962 ^ and
6963 ^ having stretched out
6964 ^ the hand of him
6967 ^ to the disciples of him,
6971 ^ he said,
6972 ^ behold,
6973 ^ the mother of me
6976 ^ and the brothers of me.
6980 ^ whoever
6981 ^ for
6982 ^ -

6984 ^ the will
6986 ^ the father of me
6989 ^ who [is]
6990 ^ in [the] heavens,
6992 ^ he
6993 ^ my brother
6995 ^ and sister
6997 ^ and mother
6999 ^ is.
7000 ^ in the day that,
7004 ^ having gone forth
7005 ^ - jesus
7007 ^ [from] the house,
7009 ^ was sitting
7010 ^ by the sea.
7013 ^ and
7014 ^ were gathered together
7015 ^ to him
7017 ^ crowds great,
7019 ^ so that
7020 ^ he
7021 ^ into a boat
7023 ^ having entered
7024 ^ sat down,
7025 ^ and
7026 ^ all the crowd
7029 ^ on the shore
7032 ^ stood.
7033 ^ and
7034 ^ he spoke
7035 ^ to them
7036 ^ many things
7037 ^ in parables,
7039 ^ saying,
7040 ^ behold,
7041 ^ went out

7046 ^ and
7047 ^ in - sowing
7050 ^ of him,
7051 ^ some
7052 ^ indeed
7053 ^ fell
7054 ^ along the road,
7057 ^ and
7058 ^ having come,
7059 ^ the birds
7061 ^ devoured
7062 ^ them.
7063 ^ other

7065 ^ fell
7066 ^ upon the rocky places,
7069 ^ where
7070 ^ not
7071 ^ it had
7072 ^ soil much,
7074 ^ and
7075 ^ immediately
7076 ^ it sprang up,
7077 ^ through -
7079 ^ not

7081 ^ depth of soil;
7083 ^ [the] sun
7084 ^ now

7086 ^ they were scorched,
7087 ^ and
7088 ^ through the

7092 ^ root,
7093 ^ were dried up.
7094 ^ other

7096 ^ fell
7097 ^ upon the thorns,
7100 ^ and
7101 ^ grew up
7102 ^ the thorns,
7104 ^ and
7105 ^ choked
7106 ^ them.
7107 ^ other
7108 ^ now

7110 ^ upon the soil
7113 ^ - good,
7115 ^ and
7116 ^ were yielding
7117 ^ fruit,
7118 ^ some

7132 ^ having come to [him],
7133 ^ the disciples
7135 ^ said
7136 ^ to him,
7137 ^ because of why
7139 ^ in parables

7142 ^ to them?
7143 ^ -
7144 ^ and
7145 ^ answering,

7175 ^ he has
7176 ^ will be taken away
7177 ^ from him.
7179 ^ because of this,
7181 ^ in parables
7183 ^ to them
7184 ^ i speak:
7185 ^ because

7187 ^ not
7188 ^ do they see;
7189 ^ and
7190 ^ hearing,
7191 ^ not
7192 ^ do they hear,
7193 ^ nor

7195 ^ and
7196 ^ is fulfilled
7197 ^ in them
7198 ^ the prophecy of isaiah,

7262 ^ they hear.
7263 ^ truly
7264 ^ for
7265 ^ i say
7266 ^ to you,
7267 ^ that
7268 ^ many prophets
7270 ^ and righteous [men]
7272 ^ longed
7273 ^ to see
7274 ^ what
7275 ^ you see,

7295 ^ the word
7297 ^ of the kingdom
7299 ^ and
7300 ^ not
7301 ^ understanding,
7302 ^ comes
7303 ^ the evil one
7305 ^ and
7306 ^ snatches away
7307 ^ that having been sown
7309 ^ in the heart of him.
7313 ^ this
7314 ^ is
7315 ^ the [one]
7316 ^ on the path
7319 ^ having been sown.
7320 ^ that which
7321 ^ now
7322 ^ upon the rocky places

7349 ^ tribulation
7350 ^ or persecution
7352 ^ on account of the word,
7355 ^ immediately
7356 ^ he falls away.
7357 ^ that which
7358 ^ now
7359 ^ among the thorns
7362 ^ having been sown,
7363 ^ this
7364 ^ is
7365 ^ the [one]

8288 ^ came
8289 ^ to him

8375 ^ -
8376 ^ and
8377 ^ the disciples
8378 ^ to the crowds.

8749 ^ the
8750 ^ however
8751 ^ heart of them,
8753 ^ far away
8754 ^ is kept
8755 ^ from me;
8757 ^ in vain
8758 ^ then
8759 ^ they worship
8760 ^ me,
8761 ^ teaching [as]

8883 ^ and these
8884 ^ defile
8885 ^ the man.
8887 ^ out of
8888 ^ for
8889 ^ the heart

8900 ^ these
8901 ^ are
8902 ^ the things defiling
8904 ^ the man;

8907 ^ but
8908 ^ with unwashed hands
8910 ^ to eat,

8992 ^ -
8993 ^ and
8994 ^ answering,
8995 ^ he said,
8996 ^ not
8997 ^ it is
8998 ^ right
8999 ^ to take

9117 ^ -
9118 ^ and
9119 ^ jesus,
9120 ^ having called to [him]
9121 ^ the disciples of him,
9124 ^ said,
9125 ^ i am moved with compassion

9351 ^ we took.
9352 ^ having known [this]
9353 ^ however,
9354 ^ - jesus

9481 ^ you
9482 ^ are
9483 ^ the christ,

9513 ^ in the heavens.
9516 ^ i also

9583 ^ from
9584 ^ that time

9586 ^ - jesus
9588 ^ to show
9589 ^ to the disciples of him
9592 ^ that
9593 ^ it is necessary for
9594 ^ him
9595 ^ to jerusalem
9597 ^ to go away,
9598 ^ and
9599 ^ many things
9600 ^ to suffer
9601 ^ from the elders

9606 ^ and scribes,
9608 ^ and
9609 ^ to be killed,
9610 ^ and
9611 ^ on the third day
9614 ^ to be raised.
9615 ^ and
9616 ^ having taken aside
9617 ^ him,
9618 ^ - peter
9620 ^ began
9621 ^ to rebuke
9622 ^ him,
9623 ^ saying,
9624 ^ far be it
9625 ^ from you,
9626 ^ lord;
9627 ^ never, not
9629 ^ will be
9630 ^ to you
9631 ^ this.
9632 ^ -
9633 ^ and
9634 ^ having turned
9635 ^ he said
9636 ^ - to peter,

9639 ^ behind me,
9641 ^ satan!
9642 ^ a stumbling block
9643 ^ you are

9648 ^ the things
9649 ^ - of god,
9651 ^ but
9652 ^ the
9653 ^ things of men.
9655 ^ then
9656 ^ - jesus
9658 ^ said
9659 ^ to disciples of him,
9662 ^ if
9663 ^ anyone
9664 ^ desires
9665 ^ after me
9667 ^ to come,
9668 ^ let him deny
9669 ^ himself,
9670 ^ and
9671 ^ take up
9672 ^ the cross of him,
9675 ^ and
9676 ^ follow
9677 ^ me.
9678 ^ whoever
9679 ^ for
9680 ^ if
9681 ^ might desire
9682 ^ the life of him
9685 ^ to save,
9686 ^ will lose
9687 ^ it;
9688 ^ whoever
9689 ^ however
9690 ^ -
9691 ^ might lose
9692 ^ the life of him
9695 ^ on account of me,
9697 ^ will find
9698 ^ it.
9699 ^ what
9700 ^ for
9701 ^ will it profit
9702 ^ a man,
9703 ^ if
9704 ^ the world whole
9707 ^ he gains,
9708 ^ -
9709 ^ but
9710 ^ the soul of him
9712 ^ loses?
9713 ^ or
9714 ^ what
9715 ^ will give
9716 ^ a man
9717 ^ [as] an exchange for
9718 ^ the soul of him?
9721 ^ is about
9722 ^ for
9723 ^ the son
9725 ^ of the man
9727 ^ to come
9728 ^ in the glory
9731 ^ the father of him,
9734 ^ with the angels of him;
9738 ^ and
9739 ^ then
9740 ^ he will give
9741 ^ to each
9742 ^ according to the deeds of him.
9746 ^ truly
9747 ^ i say
9748 ^ to you
9749 ^ -,
9750 ^ there are
9751 ^ some
9752 ^ of those
9753 ^ here
9754 ^ standing
9755 ^ who
9756 ^ no not
9758 ^ shall taste
9759 ^ of death
9760 ^ until
9761 ^ -
9762 ^ they have seen
9763 ^ the son
9765 ^ - of man
9767 ^ coming
9768 ^ in the kingdom of him.
9772 ^ and
9773 ^ after days six,
9776 ^ takes with [him]
9777 ^ - jesus,
9779 ^ - peter
9781 ^ and james
9783 ^ and john,
9785 ^ the brother of him,
9788 ^ and
9789 ^ brings up
9790 ^ them
9791 ^ into a mountain high
9794 ^ by themselves.
9796 ^ and
9797 ^ he was transfigured
9798 ^ before them,
9800 ^ and
9801 ^ shone
9802 ^ the face of him
9805 ^ like the sun,
9808 ^ -
9809 ^ and
9810 ^ the clothes of him
9812 ^ became
9813 ^ white
9814 ^ as the light.
9817 ^ and
9818 ^ behold,
9819 ^ appeared
9820 ^ to them
9821 ^ moses
9822 ^ and elijah,
9824 ^ talking
9825 ^ with him.
9827 ^ answering
9828 ^ now,
9829 ^ - peter
9831 ^ said
9832 ^ - to jesus,
9834 ^ lord,
9835 ^ good
9836 ^ it is
9837 ^ for us
9838 ^ here
9839 ^ to be.
9840 ^ if
9841 ^ you wish,
9842 ^ i will make
9843 ^ here
9844 ^ three tabernacles,
9846 ^ for you one,
9848 ^ and for moses one,
9851 ^ and for elijah one.
9854 ^ while yet
9855 ^ he
9856 ^ was speaking,
9857 ^ behold,
9858 ^ a cloud bright
9860 ^ overshadowed
9861 ^ them;
9862 ^ and
9863 ^ behold,
9864 ^ a voice
9865 ^ out of the cloud,
9868 ^ saying,
9869 ^ this
9870 ^ is
9871 ^ the son of me,
9874 ^ the beloved,
9876 ^ in whom
9878 ^ i am well pleased.
9879 ^ listen
9880 ^ to him!
9881 ^ and
9882 ^ having heard [it],
9883 ^ the disciples
9885 ^ fell
9886 ^ upon face of them
9889 ^ and
9890 ^ were terrified
9891 ^ greatly.
9892 ^ and
9893 ^ having come to [them]
9894 ^ - jesus,
9896 ^ and
9897 ^ having touched
9898 ^ them,
9899 ^ he said,
9900 ^ rise up,
9901 ^ and
9902 ^ not
9903 ^ be afraid.
9904 ^ having lifted up
9905 ^ and
9906 ^ the eyes of them,
9909 ^ no one
9910 ^ they saw
9911 ^ if
9912 ^ not
9913 ^ himself jesus
9915 ^ alone.
9916 ^ and
9917 ^ [as] were descending
9918 ^ they
9919 ^ from the mountain,
9922 ^ instructed
9923 ^ them
9924 ^ - jesus,
9926 ^ saying,
9927 ^ to no one
9928 ^ tell
9929 ^ the vision,
9931 ^ until that
9933 ^ the son
9935 ^ - of man
9937 ^ out from [the] dead
9939 ^ is risen.
9940 ^ and
9941 ^ asked
9942 ^ him
9943 ^ the disciples,
9945 ^ saying,
9946 ^ why
9947 ^ then
9948 ^ the scribes
9950 ^ say
9951 ^ that
9952 ^ elijah
9953 ^ it behooves
9954 ^ to come
9955 ^ first?
9956 ^ -
9957 ^ and
9958 ^ answering,
9959 ^ he said,
9960 ^ elijah
9961 ^ indeed
9962 ^ comes,
9963 ^ and
9964 ^ will restore
9965 ^ all things.
9966 ^ i say
9967 ^ however
9968 ^ to you
9969 ^ that
9970 ^ elijah
9971 ^ already
9972 ^ is come,
9973 ^ and
9974 ^ not
9975 ^ they knew
9976 ^ him,
9977 ^ but
9978 ^ did
9979 ^ to him
9981 ^ whatever
9982 ^ they desired.
9983 ^ thus
9984 ^ also,
9985 ^ the son
9987 ^ - of man
9989 ^ is about
9990 ^ to suffer
9991 ^ from them.
9993 ^ then
9994 ^ understood
9995 ^ the disciples
9997 ^ that
9998 ^ concerning john
10000 ^ the baptist
10002 ^ he spoke
10003 ^ to them.
10004 ^ and
10005 ^ they having come
10006 ^ to the crowd,
10009 ^ came
10010 ^ to him
10011 ^ a man
10012 ^ kneeling down to
10013 ^ him
10014 ^ and
10015 ^ saying,
10016 ^ lord,
10017 ^ have mercy on
10018 ^ my - son,
10021 ^ for
10022 ^ he is epileptic
10023 ^ and
10024 ^ miserably
10025 ^ suffers;
10026 ^ often
10027 ^ for
10028 ^ he falls
10029 ^ into the fire,
10032 ^ and
10033 ^ often
10034 ^ into the water.
10037 ^ and
10038 ^ i brought
10039 ^ him
10040 ^ to the disciples of you,
10043 ^ and
10044 ^ not
10045 ^ they were able
10046 ^ him
10047 ^ to heal.
10048 ^ answering
10049 ^ now,
10050 ^ - jesus
10052 ^ said,
10053 ^ o generation
10055 ^ unbelieving
10056 ^ and perverted,
10058 ^ how long when
10060 ^ with you
10062 ^ will i be?
10063 ^ how long when
10065 ^ will i bear with
10066 ^ you?
10067 ^ bring
10068 ^ to me
10069 ^ him
10070 ^ here.
10071 ^ and
10072 ^ rebuked
10073 ^ him
10074 ^ - jesus,
10076 ^ and
10077 ^ went out
10078 ^ from him
10080 ^ the demon,
10082 ^ and
10083 ^ was healed
10084 ^ the boy
10086 ^ from the hour that.
10090 ^ then
10091 ^ having come
10092 ^ the disciples
10094 ^ - to jesus
10096 ^ in private,
10098 ^ they said,
10099 ^ because of why
10101 ^ we
10102 ^ not
10103 ^ were able
10104 ^ to cast out
10105 ^ it?
10106 ^ -
10107 ^ and
10108 ^ he said
10109 ^ to them,
10110 ^ because of the little faith of you.
10114 ^ truly
10115 ^ for
10116 ^ i say
10117 ^ to you,
10118 ^ if
10119 ^ you have
10120 ^ faith
10121 ^ as a seed of mustard,
10124 ^ you will say
10125 ^ to the mountain to this,
10128 ^ move
10129 ^ from here
10130 ^ to there,
10131 ^ and
10132 ^ it will move.
10133 ^ and
10134 ^ nothing
10135 ^ will be impossible
10136 ^ for you.”
10137 ^ were abiding
10138 ^ now
10139 ^ they
10140 ^ in - galilee,
10143 ^ said
10144 ^ to them
10145 ^ - jesus,
10147 ^ is about
10148 ^ the son
10150 ^ - of man
10152 ^ to be betrayed
10153 ^ into [the] hands of men,
10156 ^ and
10157 ^ they will kill
10158 ^ him,
10159 ^ and
10160 ^ on the third day
10163 ^ he will be raised up.
10164 ^ and
10165 ^ they were grieved
10166 ^ deeply.
10167 ^ having come
10168 ^ now
10169 ^ they
10170 ^ to capernaum,
10172 ^ came
10173 ^ those
10174 ^ the didrachmas
10176 ^ collecting
10177 ^ - to peter
10179 ^ and
10180 ^ said,
10181 ^ the teacher of you
10184 ^ not
10185 ^ does he pay
10186 ^ the didrachmas?
10188 ^ he says,
10189 ^ yes.
10190 ^ and
10191 ^ he having entered
10192 ^ into the house,
10195 ^ anticipated
10196 ^ him
10197 ^ - jesus,
10199 ^ saying,
10200 ^ what
10201 ^ you
10202 ^ do think,
10203 ^ simon?
10204 ^ the kings
10206 ^ of the earth,
10208 ^ from whom
10210 ^ do they receive
10211 ^ custom
10212 ^ or tribute?
10214 ^ from the sons of them,
10218 ^ or
10219 ^ from - strangers?
10222 ^ he having said
10223 ^ now,
10224 ^ from the strangers,
10227 ^ said
10228 ^ to him
10229 ^ - jesus,
10231 ^ then
10232 ^ free
10233 ^ are
10234 ^ the sons.
10236 ^ that
10237 ^ however
10238 ^ not
10239 ^ we might offend
10240 ^ them,
10241 ^ having gone
10242 ^ to sea,
10244 ^ cast
10245 ^ a hook,
10246 ^ and
10247 ^ the

10260 ^ having taken,
10261 ^ give
10262 ^ to them
10263 ^ for me
10265 ^ and yourself.
10267 ^ in that - hour
10271 ^ came
10272 ^ the disciples
10274 ^ - to jesus,
10276 ^ saying,
10277 ^ who
10278 ^ then
10279 ^ [the] greatest
10280 ^ is
10281 ^ in the kingdom
10284 ^ of the heavens?
10286 ^ and
10287 ^ having called to [him]
10288 ^ a child,
10289 ^ he set
10290 ^ it
10291 ^ in midst of them,
10294 ^ and
10295 ^ said,

10350 ^ of the little ones
10352 ^ of these
10353 ^ - believing
10355 ^ in me,
10357 ^ it is better

10739 ^ having begun
10740 ^ then
10741 ^ he
10742 ^ to settle,

10771 ^ having fallen down
10772 ^ therefore
10773 ^ the servant

10801 ^ the servant same
10804 ^ found
10805 ^ one
10806 ^ the fellow servants of him
10809 ^ who
10810 ^ was owing
10811 ^ him
10812 ^ a hundred denarii,
10814 ^ and
10815 ^ having seized
10816 ^ him
10817 ^ he was throttling [him],
10818 ^ saying,
10819 ^ pay
10820 ^ if
10821 ^ any
10822 ^ you owe.’
10823 ^ having fallen down
10824 ^ therefore,
10825 ^ the fellow servant of him
10828 ^ was begging
10829 ^ him,
10830 ^ saying,
10831 ^ have patience
10832 ^ with me,
10834 ^ and
10835 ^ i will pay
10836 ^ you.
10837 ^ -
10838 ^ but
10839 ^ not
10840 ^ he was willing,
10841 ^ rather
10842 ^ having gone,
10843 ^ he cast
10844 ^ him
10845 ^ into prison,
10847 ^ until
10848 ^ he should pay
10849 ^ that which was owing.
10851 ^ having seen
10852 ^ therefore
10853 ^ the fellow servants of him
10856 ^ the things having taken place,
10858 ^ they were grieved
10859 ^ deeply,
10860 ^ and
10861 ^ having gone,
10862 ^ narrated
10863 ^ to master of themselves
10866 ^ all
10867 ^ that having taken place.
10869 ^ then
10870 ^ having called to
10871 ^ him,
10872 ^ the master of him
10875 ^ says
10876 ^ to him,
10877 ^ servant evil,
10879 ^ all the debt that
10883 ^ i forgave
10884 ^ you,
10885 ^ because
10886 ^ you begged
10887 ^ me.
10888 ^ not
10889 ^ did it behoove
10890 ^ also
10891 ^ you
10892 ^ to have pitied
10893 ^ the fellow servant of you,
10896 ^ as
10897 ^ also i
10898 ^ you
10899 ^ had pitied?
10900 ^ and
10901 ^ having been angry,
10902 ^ the master of him
10905 ^ delivered
10906 ^ him
10907 ^ to the jailers,
10909 ^ until that
10911 ^ he should pay
10912 ^ all - being owed.
10915 ^ thus
10916 ^ also
10917 ^ the father of me
10920 ^ - heavenly
10922 ^ will do
10923 ^ to you,
10924 ^ if
10925 ^ not
10926 ^ you forgive
10927 ^ each
10928 ^ the brother of him,
10931 ^ from the heart of you.
10935 ^ and
10936 ^ it came to pass,
10937 ^ when
10938 ^ had finished
10939 ^ - jesus
10941 ^ the words these,
10944 ^ he withdrew
10945 ^ from - galilee
10948 ^ and
10949 ^ came
10950 ^ to the region
10953 ^ - of judea
10955 ^ beyond the jordan.
10958 ^ and
10959 ^ followed
10960 ^ him
10961 ^ crowds great,
10963 ^ and
10964 ^ he healed
10965 ^ them
10966 ^ there.
10967 ^ and
10968 ^ came
10969 ^ to him
10970 ^ pharisees,
10971 ^ testing
10972 ^ him
10973 ^ and
10974 ^ saying,
10975 ^ if
10976 ^ is it lawful
10977 ^ for a man
10978 ^ to divorce
10979 ^ the a wife to him
10982 ^ for every cause?
10985 ^ which
10986 ^ now
10987 ^ answering,
10988 ^ he said,
10989 ^ not
10990 ^ have you read
10991 ^ that
10992 ^ the [one] having created,
10994 ^ from [the] beginning
10996 ^ male
10997 ^ and female
10999 ^ made
11000 ^ them’
11001 ^ and
11002 ^ said,
11003 ^ on account of this
11005 ^ will leave
11006 ^ a man
11007 ^ the father
11009 ^ and the mother
11012 ^ and
11013 ^ be joined with
11014 ^ the wife of him,
11017 ^ and
11018 ^ will become
11019 ^ the two
11021 ^ into flesh one’
11024 ^ so that
11025 ^ no longer
11026 ^ are they
11027 ^ two,
11028 ^ but
11029 ^ flesh one.
11031 ^ what
11032 ^ therefore
11033 ^ - god
11035 ^ united together,
11036 ^ man
11037 ^ not
11038 ^ let separate.
11039 ^ they say
11040 ^ to him,
11041 ^ why
11042 ^ then
11043 ^ moses
11044 ^ did command
11045 ^ to give
11046 ^ a roll of divorce,
11048 ^ and
11049 ^ to send away
11050 ^ her?
11051 ^ he says
11052 ^ to them
11053 ^ -,
11054 ^ moses
11055 ^ in view of the hardness of heart of you
11059 ^ allowed
11060 ^ you
11061 ^ to divorce
11062 ^ the wives of you;
11065 ^ from [the] beginning
11067 ^ however
11068 ^ not
11069 ^ was [it]
11070 ^ this way.
11071 ^ i say
11072 ^ now
11073 ^ to you
11074 ^ that
11075 ^ whoever
11076 ^ -
11077 ^ shall divorce
11078 ^ - wife of him
11081 ^ except
11082 ^ for sexual immorality,
11084 ^ and
11085 ^ shall marry
11086 ^ another,
11087 ^ commits adultery.”
11088 ^ say
11089 ^ to him
11090 ^ the disciples of him
11093 ^ if
11094 ^ this
11095 ^ is
11096 ^ the case
11098 ^ of the man
11100 ^ with the wife,
11103 ^ not
11104 ^ it is better
11105 ^ to marry.
11106 ^ -
11107 ^ and
11108 ^ he said
11109 ^ to them,
11110 ^ not
11111 ^ all
11112 ^ receive
11113 ^ the word this,
11116 ^ but only [those]
11117 ^ to whom
11118 ^ it has been given.
11119 ^ there are
11120 ^ for
11121 ^ eunuchs
11122 ^ who
11123 ^ from [the] womb of [their] mother
11126 ^ were born
11127 ^ thus,
11128 ^ and
11129 ^ there are
11130 ^ eunuchs
11131 ^ who
11132 ^ were made eunuchs
11133 ^ by - men,
11136 ^ and
11137 ^ there are
11138 ^ eunuchs
11139 ^ who
11140 ^ made eunuchs of
11141 ^ themselves
11142 ^ for the sake of the kingdom
11145 ^ of the heavens.
11147 ^ the [one] being able
11149 ^ to receive [it],
11150 ^ let him receive [it].
11151 ^ then
11152 ^ were brought
11153 ^ to him
11154 ^ little children,
11155 ^ that
11156 ^ the hands
11158 ^ he might lay
11159 ^ on them,
11160 ^ and
11161 ^ he might pray.
11162 ^ -
11163 ^ however
11164 ^ the disciples
11165 ^ rebuked
11166 ^ them.
11167 ^ -
11168 ^ and
11169 ^ jesus
11170 ^ said,
11171 ^ permit
11172 ^ the little children,
11174 ^ and
11175 ^ not
11176 ^ do forbid
11177 ^ them
11178 ^ to come
11179 ^ to me;
11181 ^ of the
11182 ^ for
11183 ^ such kind
11184 ^ is
11185 ^ the kingdom
11187 ^ of the heavens.
11189 ^ and
11190 ^ having laid
11191 ^ the hands
11193 ^ upon them,
11194 ^ he departed
11195 ^ from there.
11196 ^ and
11197 ^ behold,
11198 ^ one
11199 ^ having come
11200 ^ to him,
11201 ^ said,
11202 ^ teacher,
11203 ^ what good [thing]
11205 ^ shall i do,
11206 ^ that
11207 ^ i might have
11208 ^ life eternal?
11210 ^ -
11211 ^ and
11212 ^ he said
11213 ^ to him,
11214 ^ why
11215 ^ me
11216 ^ ask you
11217 ^ about what is good?
11220 ^ only one
11221 ^ is
11222 ^ - good.

11226 ^ you desire
11227 ^ into - life
11230 ^ to enter,
11231 ^ keep

11235 ^ to him,
11236 ^ which?
11237 ^ -
11238 ^ and
11239 ^ jesus
11240 ^ said,
11241 ^ -
11242 ^ not
11243 ^ shall you murder,
11244 ^ not
11245 ^ shall you commit adultery,
11246 ^ not
11247 ^ shall you steal,
11248 ^ not
11249 ^ shall you bear false witness,
11250 ^ you shall honor
11251 ^ the father
11253 ^ and the mother,
11256 ^ and
11257 ^ you shall love
11258 ^ - neighbor of you
11261 ^ as
11262 ^ yourself.’
11263 ^ says
11264 ^ to him
11265 ^ the young man,
11267 ^ all these things
11269 ^ i have kept.
11270 ^ what
11271 ^ yet
11272 ^ lack i?
11273 ^ was saying
11274 ^ to him
11275 ^ - jesus,
11277 ^ if
11278 ^ you desire
11279 ^ perfect
11280 ^ to be,
11281 ^ go,
11282 ^ sell
11283 ^ of you the possessing,
11286 ^ and
11287 ^ give
11288 ^ to the poor,
11290 ^ and
11291 ^ you will have

11299 ^ having heard
11300 ^ now
11301 ^ the young man
11303 ^ the statement,
11305 ^ he went away
11306 ^ grieving;
11307 ^ he was [one]
11308 ^ for
11309 ^ having
11310 ^ possessions many.
11312 ^ -
11313 ^ and
11314 ^ jesus
11315 ^ said
11316 ^ to the disciples of him,
11319 ^ truly
11320 ^ i say
11321 ^ to you
11322 ^ that
11323 ^ a rich man

11331 ^ again
11332 ^ now
11333 ^ i say
11334 ^ to you,
11335 ^ easier for
11336 ^ [it] is
11337 ^ a camel
11338 ^ through [the] eye of a needle

11342 ^ than
11343 ^ a rich man
11344 ^ to enter
11345 ^ into the kingdom
11348 ^ of god.
11350 ^ having heard
11351 ^ now,
11352 ^ the disciples
11354 ^ were astonished

12009 ^ and
12010 ^ when
12011 ^ they drew near
12012 ^ to jerusalem
12014 ^ and
12015 ^ came
12016 ^ to bethphage
12018 ^ on the mount

12305 ^ and
12306 ^ having left

12318 ^ then,
12319 ^ having come back
12320 ^ into the city,
12323 ^ he became hungry.
12324 ^ and
12325 ^ having seen
12326 ^ fig tree one
12328 ^ along the road,
12331 ^ he came
12332 ^ to it
12334 ^ and
12335 ^ nothing

12477 ^ -
12478 ^ and
12479 ^ they were reasoning
12480 ^ with themselves,
12482 ^ saying,
12483 ^ if
12484 ^ we should say,
12485 ^ from heaven,
12487 ^ he will say
12488 ^ to us,
12489 ^ because of why
12491 ^ then

12556 ^ afterward
12557 ^ however,

12559 ^ he went.

12562 ^ to the other,
12564 ^ he said
12565 ^ likewise.
12566 ^ -
12567 ^ and
12568 ^ answering
12569 ^ he said,
12570 ^ i [will]

12572 ^ and
12573 ^ not
12574 ^ did he go.
12575 ^ which

12636 ^ another parable
12638 ^ hear:
12639 ^ a man
12640 ^ there was,
12641 ^ a master of a house,
12642 ^ who
12643 ^ planted
12644 ^ a vineyard,
12645 ^ and
12646 ^ a fence
12647 ^ it
12648 ^ placed around,
12649 ^ and
12650 ^ dug
12651 ^ in it
12653 ^ a winepress,
12654 ^ and
12655 ^ built
12656 ^ a tower,
12657 ^ and
12658 ^ rented out
12659 ^ it
12660 ^ to farmers,
12661 ^ and
12662 ^ traveled abroad.
12663 ^ when
12664 ^ then
12665 ^ drew near
12666 ^ the season
12668 ^ of the fruits,
12670 ^ he sent
12671 ^ the servants of him
12674 ^ to the farmers
12677 ^ to receive
12678 ^ the fruits of him.
12681 ^ and
12682 ^ having taken
12683 ^ the farmers
12685 ^ the servants of him,
12688 ^ one
12689 ^ -
12690 ^ they beat,
12691 ^ one
12692 ^ then
12693 ^ they killed,
12694 ^ one
12695 ^ then
12696 ^ they stoned.
12697 ^ again
12698 ^ he sent
12699 ^ other servants,
12701 ^ more
12702 ^ than the first,
12704 ^ and
12705 ^ they did
12706 ^ to them
12707 ^ likewise.
12708 ^ afterward
12709 ^ then,
12710 ^ he sent
12711 ^ to them
12713 ^ the son of him,
12716 ^ saying,
12717 ^ they will respect
12718 ^ the son of me.
12721 ^ -
12722 ^ but
12723 ^ the farmers
12724 ^ having seen
12725 ^ the son,
12727 ^ said
12728 ^ among themselves,
12730 ^ this
12731 ^ is
12732 ^ the heir;
12734 ^ come,
12735 ^ let us kill
12736 ^ him
12737 ^ and
12738 ^ gain possession of
12739 ^ the inheritance of him.
12742 ^ and
12743 ^ having taking
12744 ^ him,
12745 ^ they cast [him]
12746 ^ out of the vineyard
12749 ^ and
12750 ^ killed [him].
12751 ^ when
12752 ^ therefore
12753 ^ shall come
12754 ^ the master
12756 ^ of the vineyard,
12758 ^ what
12759 ^ will he do
12760 ^ the farmers to those?
12763 ^ they say
12764 ^ to him,
12765 ^ [the] wretches,
12766 ^ grievously
12767 ^ he will destroy
12768 ^ them,
12769 ^ and
12770 ^ the vineyard
12772 ^ he will rent out
12773 ^ to other farmers,
12775 ^ who
12776 ^ will give
12777 ^ to him
12778 ^ the fruits
12780 ^ in the seasons of them.
12784 ^ says
12785 ^ to them
12786 ^ - jesus,
12788 ^ never
12789 ^ did you read
12790 ^ in the scriptures:
12793 ^ [the] stone
12794 ^ which
12795 ^ rejected
12796 ^ those building,
12798 ^ this
12799 ^ has become
12800 ^ the chief corner.
12803 ^ from [the] lord
12805 ^ was
12806 ^ this,
12807 ^ and
12808 ^ it is
12809 ^ marvelous
12810 ^ in [the] eyes of us?’
12813 ^ because of this
12815 ^ i say
12816 ^ to you
12817 ^ that
12818 ^ will be taken away
12819 ^ from you
12821 ^ the kingdom
12823 ^ - of god,
12825 ^ and
12826 ^ it will be given
12827 ^ to a people
12828 ^ producing
12829 ^ the fruits of it.
12832 ^ and
12833 ^ the [one] having fallen
12835 ^ on the stone this
12839 ^ will be broken;
12840 ^ on whomever
12842 ^ but
12843 ^ -
12844 ^ it shall fall,
12845 ^ it will grind to powder
12846 ^ him.
12847 ^ and
12848 ^ having heard
12849 ^ the chief priests
12851 ^ and the pharisees
12854 ^ the parables of him,
12857 ^ they knew
12858 ^ that
12859 ^ about them
12861 ^ he speaks.
12862 ^ and
12863 ^ seeking
12864 ^ him
12865 ^ to lay hold of,
12866 ^ they feared
12867 ^ the crowds,
12869 ^ because
12870 ^ as a prophet
12872 ^ him
12873 ^ they were holding.
12874 ^ and
12875 ^ answering,
12876 ^ - jesus
12878 ^ again
12879 ^ spoke
12880 ^ in parables
12882 ^ to them,
12883 ^ saying,
12884 ^ has become like
12885 ^ the kingdom
12887 ^ of the heavens
12889 ^ to a man,
12890 ^ a king,
12891 ^ who
12892 ^ made
12893 ^ a wedding feast
12894 ^ for the son of him.
12897 ^ and
12898 ^ he sent
12899 ^ the servants of him
12902 ^ to call
12903 ^ those having been invited
12905 ^ to the wedding feast,
12908 ^ and
12909 ^ not
12910 ^ they were willing
12911 ^ to come.
12912 ^ again
12913 ^ he sent
12914 ^ other servants,
12916 ^ saying,
12917 ^ say
12918 ^ to those having been invited,
12920 ^ behold,
12921 ^ the dinner of me
12924 ^ i have prepared,
12925 ^ the oxen of me
12928 ^ and the fatlings
12931 ^ have been killed,
12932 ^ and
12933 ^ all things [are]
12934 ^ ready;
12935 ^ come
12936 ^ to the wedding feast.
12939 ^ -
12940 ^ and
12941 ^ having paid no attention
12942 ^ they went away,
12943 ^ one
12944 ^ -
12945 ^ to the own field,
12949 ^ one
12950 ^ then
12951 ^ to the business of him.
12955 ^ -
12956 ^ and
12957 ^ the rest,
12958 ^ having laid hold of
12959 ^ the servants of him,
12962 ^ mistreated
12963 ^ and
12964 ^ killed [them].
12965 ^ -
12966 ^ and
12967 ^ the king
12968 ^ was angry,
12969 ^ and
12970 ^ having sent
12971 ^ the armies of him,
12974 ^ he destroyed
12975 ^ the murderers those,
12978 ^ and
12979 ^ the city of them
12982 ^ he burned.
12983 ^ then
12984 ^ he says
12985 ^ to servants of him,
12988 ^ the
12989 ^ indeed
12990 ^ wedding feast
12991 ^ ready
12992 ^ is;
12993 ^ those
12994 ^ however
12995 ^ having been invited
12996 ^ not
12997 ^ were
12998 ^ worthy.
12999 ^ go
13000 ^ therefore
13001 ^ into the thoroughfares
13004 ^ of the highways,
13006 ^ and
13007 ^ as many as
13008 ^ if
13009 ^ you shall find,
13010 ^ invite
13011 ^ to the wedding feast.
13014 ^ and
13015 ^ having gone out
13016 ^ the servants those
13019 ^ into the highways,
13022 ^ they brought together
13023 ^ all
13024 ^ as many as
13025 ^ they found,
13026 ^ evil both
13028 ^ and good;
13030 ^ and
13031 ^ became full
13032 ^ the wedding hall
13034 ^ of those reclining.
13035 ^ having entered in
13036 ^ then
13037 ^ the king
13039 ^ to see
13040 ^ those reclining,
13042 ^ he beheld
13043 ^ there
13044 ^ a man
13045 ^ not
13046 ^ being dressed
13047 ^ in clothes of wedding;
13049 ^ and
13050 ^ he says
13051 ^ to him,
13052 ^ friend,
13053 ^ how
13054 ^ did you enter
13055 ^ here
13056 ^ not
13057 ^ having
13058 ^ garment of wedding?
13060 ^ -
13061 ^ and
13062 ^ he was speechless.
13063 ^ then
13064 ^ the king
13066 ^ said
13067 ^ to the servants,
13069 ^ having bound
13070 ^ his feet
13072 ^ and hands,
13074 ^ cast out
13075 ^ him
13076 ^ into the darkness
13079 ^ - outer;
13081 ^ there
13082 ^ will be
13083 ^ the weeping
13085 ^ and the gnashing
13088 ^ of the teeth.
13090 ^ many
13091 ^ for
13092 ^ are
13093 ^ called,
13094 ^ few
13095 ^ however
13096 ^ chosen.
13097 ^ then
13098 ^ having gone out,
13099 ^ the pharisees
13101 ^ counsel
13102 ^ took
13103 ^ how
13104 ^ him
13105 ^ they might trap
13106 ^ in his words.
13108 ^ and
13109 ^ they send
13110 ^ to him
13111 ^ the disciples of them,
13114 ^ with the herodians,
13117 ^ saying,
13118 ^ teacher,
13119 ^ we know
13120 ^ that
13121 ^ true
13122 ^ you are,
13123 ^ and
13124 ^ the way
13126 ^ - of god
13128 ^ in [the] truth
13130 ^ you teach,
13131 ^ and
13132 ^ not
13133 ^ there is care
13134 ^ to you
13135 ^ about no one,
13137 ^ not
13138 ^ for
13139 ^ you look
13140 ^ on [the] appearance of men.
13143 ^ tell
13144 ^ therefore
13145 ^ us
13146 ^ what
13147 ^ you
13148 ^ think?
13149 ^ is it lawful
13150 ^ to give
13151 ^ tribute
13152 ^ to caesar,
13153 ^ or
13154 ^ not?
13155 ^ having known
13156 ^ however
13157 ^ - jesus
13159 ^ the malice of them,
13162 ^ he said,
13163 ^ why
13164 ^ me
13165 ^ do you test,
13166 ^ hypocrites?
13167 ^ show
13168 ^ me
13169 ^ the coin
13171 ^ of the tribute.
13173 ^ -
13174 ^ and
13175 ^ they presented
13176 ^ to him
13177 ^ a denarius.
13178 ^ and
13179 ^ he says
13180 ^ to them,
13181 ^ whose [is] the likeness
13184 ^ this?
13185 ^ and whose inscription?
13188 ^ they say
13189 ^ to him
13190 ^ caesar’s.
13191 ^ then

14190 ^ and
14191 ^ having gone forth
14192 ^ - jesus
14194 ^ from the temple,
14197 ^ he was going away,
14198 ^ and
14199 ^ came to [him]
14200 ^ the disciples of him
14203 ^ to point out
14204 ^ to him
14205 ^ the buildings
14207 ^ of the temple.
14209 ^ -
14210 ^ and
14211 ^ answering,
14212 ^ he said
14213 ^ to them,

14215 ^ do you see
14216 ^ these things all?
14218 ^ truly
14219 ^ i say
14220 ^ to you,
14221 ^ none not even
14223 ^ shall be left

14226 ^ upon stone,
14228 ^ which
14229 ^ not
14230 ^ will be thrown down.
14231 ^ [as] was sitting
14232 ^ now
14233 ^ he
14234 ^ upon the mount
14237 ^ - of olives,
14239 ^ came to
14240 ^ him
14241 ^ the disciples
14243 ^ in private,
14245 ^ saying,
14246 ^ tell
14247 ^ us,
14248 ^ when
14249 ^ these things
14250 ^ will be?

14258 ^ and of the consummation
14260 ^ of the age?
14262 ^ and
14263 ^ answering,
14264 ^ - jesus
14266 ^ said
14267 ^ to them,
14268 ^ take heed,
14269 ^ lest
14270 ^ anyone
14271 ^ you
14272 ^ mislead.
14273 ^ many
14274 ^ for
14275 ^ will come
14276 ^ in the name of me,
14280 ^ saying,
14281 ^ i

14283 ^ the christ,
14285 ^ and
14286 ^ many
14287 ^ they will mislead.
14288 ^ you will begin
14289 ^ then
14290 ^ to hear of
14291 ^ wars
14292 ^ and rumors of wars.
14295 ^ behold,
14296 ^ not
14297 ^ be alarmed;
14298 ^ it is necessary
14299 ^ for
14300 ^ to take place,
14301 ^ but
14302 ^ not yet
14303 ^ is
14304 ^ the end.
14306 ^ will rise up
14307 ^ for
14308 ^ nation
14309 ^ against nation,
14311 ^ and

14355 ^ one another;
14356 ^ and
14357 ^ many false prophets
14359 ^ will arise
14360 ^ and
14361 ^ will mislead
14362 ^ many.
14363 ^ and
14364 ^ because - is to be multiplied
14367 ^ - lawlessness,
14369 ^ will grow cold
14370 ^ the love
14372 ^ of the many.
14374 ^ the [one]
14375 ^ however
14376 ^ having endured
14377 ^ to [the] end,
14379 ^ he

14381 ^ and
14382 ^ there will be proclaimed
14383 ^ this - gospel
14386 ^ of the kingdom
14388 ^ in all the earth,
14392 ^ for a testimony
14394 ^ to all the nations;
14397 ^ and
14398 ^ then
14399 ^ will come
14400 ^ the end.
14402 ^ when
14403 ^ therefore
14404 ^ you shall see
14405 ^ the abomination
14407 ^ - of desolation,’
14409 ^ - having been spoken of
14411 ^ by daniel
14413 ^ the prophet,
14415 ^ standing
14416 ^ in [the] place holy —
14419 ^ the [one] reading
14421 ^ let him understand —
14422 ^ then
14423 ^ those
14424 ^ in - judea,
14427 ^ let them flee
14428 ^ to the mountains;
14431 ^ the [one]

14435 ^ not
14436 ^ let him come down
14437 ^ to take
14438 ^ anything
14439 ^ out of the house of him;
14443 ^ and

14450 ^ back
14451 ^ to take
14452 ^ the cloak of him.
14455 ^ woe
14456 ^ then
14457 ^ to those
14458 ^ in womb
14460 ^ having,
14461 ^ and
14462 ^ to the [ones] nursing infants
14464 ^ in those the days.
14468 ^ pray
14469 ^ however
14470 ^ that
14471 ^ not
14472 ^ might be
14473 ^ the flight of you
14476 ^ in winter,
14477 ^ nor
14478 ^ on a sabbath.
14479 ^ there will be
14480 ^ for
14481 ^ then
14482 ^ tribulation great,
14484 ^ such as
14485 ^ not
14486 ^ has been
14487 ^ from [the] beginning of [the] world
14490 ^ until - now,
14493 ^ no
14494 ^ never not

14497 ^ and
14498 ^ if
14499 ^ not

14510 ^ however
14511 ^ the elect,
14513 ^ will be shortened
14514 ^ the days those.
14517 ^ then
14518 ^ if
14519 ^ anyone
14520 ^ to you
14521 ^ says,
14522 ^ behold,
14523 ^ here [is]
14524 ^ the christ,
14526 ^ or
14527 ^ here,
14528 ^ not
14529 ^ believe [it].
14530 ^ there will arise
14531 ^ for
14532 ^ false christs
14533 ^ and false prophets,
14535 ^ and
14536 ^ they will give
14537 ^ signs great,
14539 ^ and wonders,
14541 ^ so as
14542 ^ to mislead,
14543 ^ if
14544 ^ possible,
14545 ^ even
14546 ^ the elect.
14548 ^ behold,
14549 ^ i have foretold [it]
14550 ^ to you.
14551 ^ if
14552 ^ therefore
14553 ^ they say
14554 ^ to you,
14555 ^ behold,
14556 ^ in the wilderness
14559 ^ he is,
14560 ^ not
14561 ^ go forth;
14562 ^ [or] ‘behold,
14563 ^ in the inner rooms,
14566 ^ not
14567 ^ believe [it].
14568 ^ just as
14569 ^ for
14570 ^ the lightning
14572 ^ comes forth
14573 ^ from [the] east
14575 ^ and
14576 ^ shines
14577 ^ as far as [the] west,
14579 ^ so
14580 ^ will be
14581 ^ the coming
14583 ^ of the son
14585 ^ - of man.
14587 ^ for wherever
14588 ^ if
14589 ^ may be
14590 ^ the carcass,
14592 ^ there
14593 ^ will be gathered
14594 ^ the vultures.
14596 ^ immediately
14597 ^ then
14598 ^ after the tribulation
14601 ^ the days of those:
14604 ^ the sun
14606 ^ will be darkened,
14607 ^ and
14608 ^ the moon
14610 ^ not
14611 ^ will give
14612 ^ the light of it,
14615 ^ and
14616 ^ the stars
14618 ^ will fall
14619 ^ from the sky,
14622 ^ and
14623 ^ the powers
14625 ^ of the heavens
14627 ^ will be shaken.’
14628 ^ and
14629 ^ then
14630 ^ will appear
14631 ^ the sign
14633 ^ of the son
14635 ^ - of man
14637 ^ in heaven,
14639 ^ and
14640 ^ then
14641 ^ will mourn
14642 ^ all the tribes
14645 ^ of the earth,
14647 ^ and
14648 ^ they will see
14649 ^ the son
14651 ^ - of man
14653 ^ coming
14654 ^ on the clouds
14657 ^ - of heaven
14659 ^ with power
14661 ^ and glory great.
14664 ^ and
14665 ^ he will send
14666 ^ the angels of him
14669 ^ with a trumpet call great,
14672 ^ and
14673 ^ they will gather together
14674 ^ the elect of him,
14677 ^ from the four winds,
14681 ^ from [the] ends of the heavens
14684 ^ to the ends of them.
14688 ^ of
14689 ^ now
14690 ^ the fig tree
14692 ^ learn
14693 ^ the parable:
14695 ^ when
14696 ^ already
14697 ^ the branch of it
14700 ^ may have become
14701 ^ tender
14702 ^ and
14703 ^ the leaves
14705 ^ it puts forth,
14706 ^ you know
14707 ^ that
14708 ^ near [is]
14709 ^ the summer.
14711 ^ thus
14712 ^ also
14713 ^ you,
14714 ^ when
14715 ^ you see
14716 ^ all these things,
14718 ^ know
14719 ^ that
14720 ^ near
14721 ^ he is,
14722 ^ at [the] doors.
14724 ^ truly
14725 ^ i say
14726 ^ to you
14727 ^ that
14728 ^ no not
14730 ^ will have passed away
14731 ^ the generation this
14734 ^ until
14735 ^ -
14736 ^ all these things
14738 ^ shall have taken place.
14739 ^ the heaven
14741 ^ and the earth
14744 ^ will pass away,
14745 ^ -
14746 ^ but
14747 ^ the words of me
14749 ^ no not
14751 ^ shall pass away.
14752 ^ concerning
14753 ^ however
14754 ^ the day that
14757 ^ and hour,
14759 ^ no one
14760 ^ knows,
14761 ^ not even
14762 ^ the angels
14764 ^ of the heavens,
14766 ^ nor
14767 ^ the son,
14769 ^ if
14770 ^ not
14771 ^ the father
14773 ^ only.
14774 ^ as [were]
14775 ^ for
14776 ^ the days
14778 ^ - of noah,
14780 ^ so
14781 ^ will be
14782 ^ the coming
14784 ^ of the son
14786 ^ - of man.
14788 ^ as
14789 ^ for
14790 ^ they were
14791 ^ in the days
14794 ^ those
14795 ^ -
14796 ^ before the flood,
14799 ^ eating
14800 ^ and
14801 ^ drinking,
14802 ^ marrying
14803 ^ and
14804 ^ giving in marriage,
14805 ^ until that day
14808 ^ entered
14809 ^ noah
14810 ^ into the ark.
14813 ^ and
14814 ^ not
14815 ^ they knew,
14816 ^ until
14817 ^ came
14818 ^ the flood
14820 ^ and
14821 ^ took away
14822 ^ all;
14823 ^ thus
14824 ^ will be
14825 ^ also
14826 ^ the coming
14828 ^ of the son
14830 ^ - of man.
14832 ^ then
14833 ^ two
14834 ^ will be
14835 ^ in the field:
14838 ^ one
14839 ^ is taken,
14840 ^ and
14841 ^ one
14842 ^ is left.
14843 ^ two [women]
14844 ^ will be grinding
14845 ^ at the mill:
14848 ^ one
14849 ^ is taken,
14850 ^ and
14851 ^ one
14852 ^ is left.
14853 ^ keep watch
14854 ^ therefore,
14855 ^ for
14856 ^ not
14857 ^ you know
14858 ^ on what day
14860 ^ the lord of you
14863 ^ comes.
14864 ^ this
14865 ^ then
14866 ^ know,
14867 ^ that
14868 ^ if
14869 ^ had known
14870 ^ the master of the house
14872 ^ in what time of night
14874 ^ the thief
14876 ^ comes,
14877 ^ he would have watched
14878 ^ -
14879 ^ and
14880 ^ not
14881 ^ -
14882 ^ have allowed
14883 ^ to be broken into
14884 ^ the house of him.
14887 ^ because of this
14889 ^ also,
14890 ^ you
14891 ^ be
14892 ^ ready,
14893 ^ for
14894 ^ in that
14895 ^ not
14896 ^ you expect
14897 ^ hour,
14898 ^ the son
14900 ^ - of man
14902 ^ comes.
14903 ^ who
14904 ^ then
14905 ^ is
14906 ^ the faithful servant,
14909 ^ and wise,
14911 ^ whom
14912 ^ has set
14913 ^ the master
14915 ^ over the household of him,
14919 ^ - to give
14921 ^ to them
14922 ^ the food
14924 ^ in season?
14926 ^ blessed [is]
14927 ^ the servant that,
14930 ^ whom
14931 ^ having come,
14932 ^ the master of him
14935 ^ will find
14936 ^ thus
14937 ^ doing.
14938 ^ truly
14939 ^ i say
14940 ^ to you
14941 ^ that
14942 ^ over all the possessing of him
14947 ^ he will set
14948 ^ him.
14949 ^ if
14950 ^ however
14951 ^ should say
14952 ^ the evil servant that
14956 ^ in the heart of him,
14960 ^ delays
14961 ^ of me the master,
14964 ^ and
14965 ^ should begin
14966 ^ to beat
14967 ^ the fellow servants of him,
14970 ^ to eat
14971 ^ then
14972 ^ and
14973 ^ to drink
14974 ^ with those being drunkards,
14977 ^ will come
14978 ^ the master
14980 ^ the servant of that
14983 ^ in a day
14985 ^ in which
14986 ^ not
14987 ^ he does expect,
14988 ^ and in an hour
14991 ^ which
14992 ^ not
14993 ^ he is aware,
14994 ^ and
14995 ^ will cut in pieces
14996 ^ him,
14997 ^ and
14998 ^ the place of him
15001 ^ with the hypocrites
15004 ^ will appoint;
15005 ^ there
15006 ^ will be
15007 ^ the weeping
15009 ^ and the gnashing
15012 ^ of teeth.
15014 ^ then
15015 ^ will be likened
15016 ^ the kingdom
15018 ^ of the heavens
15020 ^ to ten virgins,
15022 ^ who
15023 ^ having taken
15024 ^ the lamps of them,
15027 ^ went forth
15028 ^ to meet
15030 ^ the bridegroom.
15032 ^ five
15033 ^ now
15034 ^ of them
15036 ^ were
15037 ^ foolish,
15038 ^ and
15039 ^ five
15040 ^ wise.
15041 ^ the
15042 ^ for
15043 ^ foolish,
15044 ^ having taken
15045 ^ the lamps of them,
15048 ^ not
15049 ^ did take
15050 ^ with them
15052 ^ oil;
15053 ^ -
15054 ^ but
15055 ^ the wise
15056 ^ took
15057 ^ oil
15058 ^ in the vessels,
15061 ^ with the lamps of them.
15065 ^ tarrying
15066 ^ then
15067 ^ the bridegroom,
15069 ^ they became drowsy
15070 ^ all
15071 ^ and
15072 ^ were sleeping.
15073 ^ at middle
15074 ^ then
15075 ^ of [the] night,
15076 ^ a cry
15077 ^ there was:
15078 ^ behold,
15079 ^ the bridegroom!
15081 ^ go forth
15082 ^ to meet him!
15085 ^ then
15086 ^ arose
15087 ^ all the virgins those
15091 ^ and
15092 ^ trimmed
15093 ^ the lamps of them.
15096 ^ -
15097 ^ and
15098 ^ the foolish
15099 ^ to the wise
15101 ^ said,
15102 ^ give
15103 ^ us
15104 ^ of the oil of you,
15108 ^ for
15109 ^ the lamps of us
15112 ^ are going out.
15113 ^ answered
15114 ^ then
15115 ^ the wise,
15117 ^ saying,
15118 ^ lest
15119 ^ no not even
15121 ^ it might suffice
15122 ^ for us
15123 ^ and you.
15125 ^ go
15126 ^ rather
15127 ^ to those selling,
15130 ^ and
15131 ^ buy
15132 ^ for yourselves.
15133 ^ [while] are going away
15134 ^ then
15135 ^ they
15136 ^ to buy,
15137 ^ came
15138 ^ the bridegroom,
15140 ^ and
15141 ^ those ready
15143 ^ went in
15144 ^ with him
15146 ^ to the wedding feast;
15149 ^ and
15150 ^ was shut

15761 ^ -
15762 ^ but
15763 ^ the righteous
15764 ^ into life eternal.
15767 ^ and
15768 ^ it came to pass,
15769 ^ when
15770 ^ had finished
15771 ^ - jesus
15773 ^ all the words these,
15777 ^ he said

15790 ^ the son
15792 ^ - of man
15794 ^ is delivered
15795 ^ over - to be crucified.
15798 ^ then
15799 ^ were gathered together
15800 ^ the chief priests
15802 ^ and the elders
15805 ^ of the people
15807 ^ in the courtyard
15810 ^ of the high priest,
15812 ^ who is called

15815 ^ and
15816 ^ they plotted together,
15817 ^ in order that
15818 ^ - jesus
15820 ^ by guile
15821 ^ they might seize
15822 ^ and
15823 ^ kill.
15824 ^ they were saying
15825 ^ however,
15826 ^ not

15849 ^ to him
15850 ^ a woman,
15851 ^ having
15852 ^ an alabaster flask
15853 ^ fragrant oil very costly,
15855 ^ and
15856 ^ poured [it]
15857 ^ on the head of him
15861 ^ [as] he is reclining.
15862 ^ having seen
15863 ^ then,
15864 ^ the disciples
15866 ^ became indignant,
15867 ^ saying,
15868 ^ for what purpose
15870 ^ [is] the waste this?
15873 ^ could
15874 ^ for
15875 ^ this
15876 ^ have been sold
15877 ^ for much,
15878 ^ and
15879 ^ have been given
15880 ^ to [the] poor.
15881 ^ having known [this]
15882 ^ now,
15883 ^ - jesus
15885 ^ said
15886 ^ to them,
15887 ^ why
15888 ^ trouble
15889 ^ do you cause
15890 ^ to the woman?
15892 ^ a work
15893 ^ for
15894 ^ beautiful
15895 ^ she did
15896 ^ to me.
15898 ^ always
15899 ^ for
15900 ^ the poor
15902 ^ you have
15903 ^ with you;
15905 ^ me
15906 ^ however
15907 ^ not
15908 ^ always
15909 ^ you have.
15910 ^ in pouring
15911 ^ for
15912 ^ this [woman]
15913 ^ the fragrant oil this
15916 ^ on the body of me,
15920 ^ for the burial
15923 ^ of me
15924 ^ she did [it].
15925 ^ truly
15926 ^ i say
15927 ^ to you,
15928 ^ wherever
15929 ^ if
15930 ^ shall be proclaimed
15931 ^ the gospel this
15934 ^ in all the world,
15938 ^ will be spoken of
15939 ^ also
15940 ^ that which
15941 ^ did
15942 ^ this [woman],
15943 ^ for a memorial of her.
15946 ^ then
15947 ^ having gone
15948 ^ one
15949 ^ of the twelve,
15951 ^ the [one] being called
15953 ^ judas iscariot,
15955 ^ to the chief priests,
15958 ^ he said,
15959 ^ what
15960 ^ are you willing
15961 ^ me
15962 ^ to give,
15963 ^ and i
15964 ^ to you
15965 ^ will betray
15966 ^ him?
15967 ^ -
15968 ^ and
15969 ^ they appointed
15970 ^ to him
15971 ^ thirty pieces of silver.
15973 ^ and
15974 ^ from that time,
15976 ^ he was seeking
15977 ^ an opportunity
15978 ^ that
15979 ^ him
15980 ^ he might betray.
15981 ^ on the
15982 ^ now
15983 ^ first [day]
15984 ^ of the unleavened [bread],
15986 ^ came
15987 ^ the disciples
15989 ^ - to jesus,
15991 ^ saying,
15992 ^ where
15993 ^ wish you [that]
15994 ^ we should prepare
15995 ^ for you
15996 ^ to eat
15997 ^ the passover?
15999 ^ -
16000 ^ and
16001 ^ he said,
16002 ^ go
16003 ^ into the city
16006 ^ unto a certain man
16009 ^ and
16010 ^ tell
16011 ^ him
16012 ^ the teacher
16014 ^ says,
16015 ^ the time of me

16020 ^ with you
16022 ^ i will keep
16023 ^ the passover,
16025 ^ with the disciples of me.’
16029 ^ and
16030 ^ did
16031 ^ the disciples
16033 ^ as
16034 ^ directed
16035 ^ them
16036 ^ - jesus,
16038 ^ and

16043 ^ now
16044 ^ having arrived,
16045 ^ he was reclining
16046 ^ with the twelve.
16049 ^ and [as]
16050 ^ they were eating,
16051 ^ to them
16052 ^ he said,
16053 ^ truly
16054 ^ i say
16055 ^ to you
16056 ^ that
16057 ^ one
16058 ^ of you
16060 ^ will betray
16061 ^ me.
16062 ^ and
16063 ^ being grieved
16064 ^ exceedingly,
16065 ^ they began
16066 ^ to say
16067 ^ to him,
16068 ^ one each,

16071 ^ i
16072 ^ is it,
16073 ^ lord?
16074 ^ -
16075 ^ and
16076 ^ answering
16077 ^ he said,
16078 ^ the [one] having dipped
16080 ^ with me
16082 ^ the hand
16084 ^ in the dish,
16087 ^ he
16088 ^ me
16089 ^ will betray.

16101 ^ however
16102 ^ - the man
16104 ^ to that
16105 ^ by whom
16107 ^ the son
16109 ^ - of man
16111 ^ is betrayed.
16112 ^ better
16113 ^ would it be
16114 ^ for him
16115 ^ if
16116 ^ not
16117 ^ had been born
16118 ^ the man that.
16121 ^ answering
16122 ^ now
16123 ^ judas,
16124 ^ who was betraying
16126 ^ him,
16127 ^ said,
16128 ^ not
16129 ^ i
16130 ^ is it,
16131 ^ rabbi?
16132 ^ he says
16133 ^ to him,
16134 ^ you
16135 ^ have said.
16136 ^ [as] they were eating
16137 ^ now
16138 ^ of them,

16140 ^ - jesus
16142 ^ bread,
16143 ^ and
16144 ^ having blessed,
16145 ^ broke [it],
16146 ^ and
16147 ^ having given
16148 ^ to the
16149 ^ disciples,
16150 ^ he said,
16151 ^ take,
16152 ^ eat;
16153 ^ this
16154 ^ is
16155 ^ the body of me.
16158 ^ and
16159 ^ having taken
16160 ^ a cup
16161 ^ and
16162 ^ having given thanks,
16163 ^ he gave [it]
16164 ^ to them,
16165 ^ saying,
16166 ^ drink
16167 ^ of it,
16169 ^ all of you.
16170 ^ this
16171 ^ for
16172 ^ is
16173 ^ the blood
16175 ^ of me,
16176 ^ of the covenant,
16178 ^ -
16179 ^ for many
16181 ^ being poured out
16182 ^ for forgiveness of sins.
16185 ^ i say
16186 ^ now
16187 ^ to you,
16188 ^ no not
16190 ^ will i drink,
16191 ^ from now,
16193 ^ of this the fruit
16197 ^ of the vine,
16199 ^ until the day that,
16203 ^ when

16205 ^ i drink
16206 ^ with you
16208 ^ anew
16209 ^ in the kingdom
16212 ^ of the father of me.
16215 ^ and
16216 ^ having sung a hymn,
16217 ^ they went out
16218 ^ to the mount
16221 ^ - of olives.
16223 ^ then
16224 ^ says
16225 ^ to them
16226 ^ - jesus,
16228 ^ all you

16231 ^ because of me
16233 ^ during the night this.
16237 ^ it has been written
16238 ^ for:
16239 ^ i will strike
16240 ^ the shepherd,
16242 ^ and
16243 ^ will be scattered
16244 ^ the sheep
16246 ^ of the flock.’
16248 ^ after
16249 ^ however
16250 ^ - being raised,
16252 ^ i
16253 ^ will go before
16254 ^ you
16255 ^ into - galilee.
16258 ^ answering
16259 ^ now,
16260 ^ - peter
16262 ^ said
16263 ^ to him,
16264 ^ if
16265 ^ all
16266 ^ will fall away
16267 ^ because of you,
16269 ^ i
16270 ^ never
16271 ^ will fall away.
16272 ^ said
16273 ^ to him
16274 ^ - jesus,
16276 ^ truly
16277 ^ i say
16278 ^ to you
16279 ^ that
16280 ^ during this - night,
16284 ^ before [the]
16285 ^ rooster
16286 ^ crowing,
16287 ^ three times
16288 ^ you will deny
16289 ^ me.
16290 ^ says
16291 ^ to him
16292 ^ - peter,
16294 ^ even if
16295 ^ it were necessary for
16296 ^ me
16297 ^ with you
16299 ^ to die,
16300 ^ no not
16302 ^ you
16303 ^ will i deny.
16304 ^ likewise
16305 ^ also,
16306 ^ all the disciples
16309 ^ said.
16310 ^ then
16311 ^ comes
16312 ^ with them
16314 ^ - jesus
16316 ^ to a place
16318 ^ called
16319 ^ gethsemane,
16320 ^ and
16321 ^ he says
16322 ^ to the disciples,
16324 ^ sit
16325 ^ here,
16326 ^ until that
16328 ^ having gone away
16329 ^ over there,
16330 ^ i shall pray.
16331 ^ and
16332 ^ having taken with [him]
16333 ^ - peter
16335 ^ and the two sons of zebedee,
16340 ^ he began
16341 ^ to be sorrowful
16342 ^ and
16343 ^ deeply distressed.
16344 ^ then
16345 ^ he says
16346 ^ to them,
16347 ^ very sorrowful
16348 ^ is
16349 ^ the soul of me,
16352 ^ even to death;
16354 ^ remain
16355 ^ here
16356 ^ and
16357 ^ watch
16358 ^ with me.
16360 ^ and
16361 ^ having gone forward
16362 ^ a little,
16363 ^ he fell
16364 ^ upon face of him,
16367 ^ praying,
16368 ^ and
16369 ^ saying,
16370 ^ father of me,
16372 ^ if
16373 ^ possible
16374 ^ it is,
16375 ^ let pass
16376 ^ from me
16378 ^ the cup this.
16381 ^ nevertheless
16382 ^ not
16383 ^ as
16384 ^ i
16385 ^ will,
16386 ^ but
16387 ^ as
16388 ^ you.
16389 ^ and
16390 ^ he comes
16391 ^ to the disciples
16394 ^ and
16395 ^ finds
16396 ^ them
16397 ^ sleeping.
16398 ^ and
16399 ^ he says
16400 ^ - to peter,
16402 ^ thus
16403 ^ not
16404 ^ were you able
16405 ^ one hour
16407 ^ to watch
16408 ^ with me?
16410 ^ watch
16411 ^ and
16412 ^ pray,
16413 ^ that
16414 ^ not
16415 ^ you enter
16416 ^ into temptation.
16418 ^ the
16419 ^ indeed
16420 ^ spirit
16421 ^ [is] willing,
16422 ^ -
16423 ^ but
16424 ^ the flesh
16425 ^ weak.
16426 ^ again
16427 ^ for a second time
16429 ^ having gone away,
16430 ^ he prayed,
16431 ^ saying,
16432 ^ father of me,
16434 ^ if
16435 ^ not
16436 ^ is possible
16437 ^ this
16438 ^ to pass
16439 ^ if
16440 ^ not
16441 ^ it
16442 ^ i drink,
16443 ^ be done
16444 ^ the will of you.
16447 ^ and
16448 ^ having come
16449 ^ again,
16450 ^ he finds
16451 ^ them
16452 ^ sleeping,
16453 ^ were
16454 ^ for
16455 ^ of them the eyes
16458 ^ heavy.
16459 ^ and
16460 ^ having left
16461 ^ them
16462 ^ again,
16463 ^ having gone away,
16464 ^ he prayed
16465 ^ for [the] third time,
16467 ^ the same thing
16470 ^ having said
16471 ^ again.
16472 ^ then
16473 ^ he comes
16474 ^ to the disciples
16477 ^ and
16478 ^ says
16479 ^ to them,
16480 ^ sleep
16481 ^ - later on
16483 ^ and
16484 ^ take your rest.
16485 ^ behold,
16486 ^ has drawn near
16487 ^ the hour,
16489 ^ and
16490 ^ the son
16492 ^ - of man
16494 ^ is betrayed
16495 ^ into [the] hands of sinners.
16498 ^ rise up,
16499 ^ let us go!
16500 ^ behold,
16501 ^ has drawn near
16502 ^ he who is betraying
16504 ^ me!
16505 ^ and
16506 ^ yet
16507 ^ of him
16508 ^ as he is speaking,
16509 ^ behold,
16510 ^ judas,
16511 ^ one
16512 ^ of the twelve,
16514 ^ came,
16515 ^ and
16516 ^ with him
16518 ^ a crowd great,
16520 ^ with swords
16522 ^ and clubs,
16524 ^ from the chief priests
16527 ^ and elders
16529 ^ of the people.
16531 ^ the [one]
16532 ^ then
16533 ^ betraying
16534 ^ him
16535 ^ gave
16536 ^ them
16537 ^ a sign,
16538 ^ saying,
16539 ^ whomever
16540 ^ -
16541 ^ i shall kiss,
16542 ^ he
16543 ^ it is;
16544 ^ seize
16545 ^ him.
16546 ^ and
16547 ^ immediately
16548 ^ having come up
16549 ^ - to jesus,
16551 ^ he said,
16552 ^ greetings,
16553 ^ rabbi,
16554 ^ and
16555 ^ kissed
16556 ^ him.
16557 ^ -
16558 ^ and
16559 ^ jesus
16560 ^ said
16561 ^ to him,
16562 ^ friend,
16563 ^ for what
16565 ^ are you come?”
16566 ^ then
16567 ^ having come to [him],
16568 ^ they laid
16569 ^ - hands
16571 ^ on - jesus
16574 ^ and
16575 ^ seized
16576 ^ him.
16577 ^ and
16578 ^ behold,
16579 ^ one
16580 ^ of those
16581 ^ with jesus,
16583 ^ having stretched out
16584 ^ the hand,
16586 ^ drew
16587 ^ the sword of him,
16590 ^ and
16591 ^ having struck
16592 ^ the servant
16594 ^ of the high priest,
16596 ^ cut off
16597 ^ of him the ear.
16600 ^ then
16601 ^ says
16602 ^ to him
16603 ^ - jesus,
16605 ^ return
16606 ^ the sword of you
16609 ^ into the place of it;
16613 ^ all
16614 ^ for
16615 ^ those having taken
16617 ^ [the] sword,
16618 ^ by [the] sword
16620 ^ will perish.
16621 ^ or
16622 ^ think you
16623 ^ that
16624 ^ not
16625 ^ i am able
16626 ^ to call upon
16627 ^ the father of me,
16630 ^ and
16631 ^ he will furnish
16632 ^ to me
16633 ^ presently
16634 ^ more than twelve legions of angels?
16638 ^ how
16639 ^ then
16640 ^ should be fulfilled
16641 ^ the scriptures,
16643 ^ that
16644 ^ so
16645 ^ it must
16646 ^ be?
16647 ^ in that - hour,
16651 ^ said
16652 ^ - jesus
16654 ^ to the crowds,
16656 ^ as
16657 ^ against a robber
16659 ^ did you come out
16660 ^ with swords
16662 ^ and clubs
16664 ^ to capture
16665 ^ me?
16666 ^ every day
16668 ^ in the temple
16671 ^ i was sitting
16672 ^ teaching,
16673 ^ and
16674 ^ not
16675 ^ you did seize
16676 ^ me.
16677 ^ this
16678 ^ then
16679 ^ all
16680 ^ is come to pass,
16681 ^ that
16682 ^ might be fulfilled
16683 ^ the scriptures
16685 ^ of the prophets.
16687 ^ then
16688 ^ the disciples all,
16691 ^ having forsaken
16692 ^ him,
16693 ^ fled.
16694 ^ those
16695 ^ then
16696 ^ having seized
16697 ^ - jesus
16699 ^ led [him] away
16700 ^ to caiaphas,
16702 ^ the high priest,
16704 ^ where
16705 ^ the scribes
16707 ^ and the elders
16710 ^ were assembled.
16711 ^ -
16712 ^ and
16713 ^ peter
16714 ^ was following
16715 ^ him
16716 ^ from afar,
16718 ^ even to the court
16721 ^ of the high priest.
16723 ^ and
16724 ^ having entered
16725 ^ within,
16726 ^ he was sitting
16727 ^ with the guards
16730 ^ to see
16731 ^ the outcome.
16733 ^ -
16734 ^ and
16735 ^ the chief priests
16736 ^ and the council whole
16740 ^ were seeking
16741 ^ false testimony
16742 ^ against - jesus,
16745 ^ so that
16746 ^ him
16747 ^ they might put to death;
16748 ^ but
16749 ^ not any
16750 ^ they found,
16751 ^ of many
16752 ^ having come forward as
16753 ^ false witnesses.
16754 ^ at last
16755 ^ then,
16756 ^ having come forward
16757 ^ two,
16758 ^ they said,
16759 ^ this [man]
16760 ^ has been saying,
16761 ^ i am able
16762 ^ to destroy
16763 ^ the temple
16765 ^ - of god,
16767 ^ and
16768 ^ in three days
16771 ^ to rebuild it.
16772 ^ and
16773 ^ having stood up,
16774 ^ the high priest
16776 ^ said
16777 ^ to him,
16778 ^ nothing
16779 ^ answer you?
16780 ^ what
16781 ^ these
16782 ^ you
16783 ^ do witness against?
16784 ^ -
16785 ^ and
16786 ^ jesus
16787 ^ was silent.
16788 ^ and
16789 ^ the high priest
16791 ^ said
16792 ^ to him,
16793 ^ i adjure
16794 ^ you
16795 ^ by - god
16798 ^ the living,
16800 ^ that
16801 ^ us
16802 ^ you tell
16803 ^ if
16804 ^ you
16805 ^ are
16806 ^ the christ,
16808 ^ the son
16810 ^ - of god.
16812 ^ says
16813 ^ to him
16814 ^ - jesus,
16816 ^ you
16817 ^ have said.
16818 ^ but
16819 ^ i say
16820 ^ to you,
16821 ^ from now
16823 ^ you will see
16824 ^ the son
16826 ^ - of man
16828 ^ sitting
16829 ^ at [the] right hand
16831 ^ - of power
16833 ^ and
16834 ^ coming
16835 ^ upon the clouds
16838 ^ - of heaven.”
16840 ^ then
16841 ^ the high priest
16843 ^ tears
16844 ^ the garments of him,
16847 ^ saying,
16848 ^ he has blasphemed;
16849 ^ why
16850 ^ any more
16851 ^ need
16852 ^ have we
16853 ^ of witnesses?
16854 ^ behold
16855 ^ now,
16856 ^ you have heard
16857 ^ the blasphemy.
16859 ^ what
16860 ^ you
16861 ^ do think?
16862 ^ -
16863 ^ and
16864 ^ answering
16865 ^ they said,
16866 ^ deserving of death
16868 ^ he is.
16869 ^ then
16870 ^ they spat
16871 ^ in the face of him,
16875 ^ and
16876 ^ struck
16877 ^ him.
16878 ^ others
16879 ^ then
16880 ^ slapped [him],
16881 ^ saying,
16882 ^ prophesy
16883 ^ to us,
16884 ^ christ,
16885 ^ who
16886 ^ is
16887 ^ the [one] having struck
16889 ^ you?
16890 ^ -
16891 ^ and
16892 ^ peter
16893 ^ was sitting
16894 ^ outside
16895 ^ in the court,
16898 ^ and
16899 ^ came
16900 ^ to him
16901 ^ one servant girl,
16903 ^ saying,
16904 ^ also
16905 ^ you
16906 ^ were
16907 ^ with jesus
16909 ^ the galilean.
16911 ^ -
16912 ^ and
16913 ^ he denied
16914 ^ before all,
16916 ^ saying,
16917 ^ not
16918 ^ i know
16919 ^ what
16920 ^ you say.
16921 ^ having gone out
16922 ^ then
16923 ^ to the porch,
16926 ^ saw
16927 ^ him
16928 ^ another [servant girl],
16929 ^ and
16930 ^ says
16931 ^ to those there,
16933 ^ this [man]
16934 ^ was
16935 ^ with jesus
16937 ^ of nazareth.
16939 ^ and
16940 ^ again
16941 ^ he denied
16942 ^ with an oath
16944 ^ -,
16945 ^ not
16946 ^ i know
16947 ^ the man.
16949 ^ after a little while,
16951 ^ also
16952 ^ having come to [him]
16953 ^ those standing by,
16955 ^ they said
16956 ^ - to peter,
16958 ^ surely
16959 ^ also
16960 ^ you
16961 ^ of them
16963 ^ are,
16964 ^ even
16965 ^ for
16966 ^ the speech of you
16969 ^ away
16970 ^ you
16971 ^ gives.
16972 ^ then
16973 ^ he began
16974 ^ to curse
16975 ^ and
16976 ^ to swear

17017 ^ of the people
17019 ^ against - jesus,
17022 ^ so that

17044 ^ the thirty pieces of silver
17047 ^ to the chief priests

17083 ^ it is lawful
17084 ^ to put
17085 ^ them

18886 ^ him.
18887 ^ and
18888 ^ very early,
18889 ^ in night still much,
18891 ^ having risen up,
18892 ^ he went out
18893 ^ and
18894 ^ departed
18895 ^ into solitary a place,
18898 ^ and there
18899 ^ he was praying.
18900 ^ and
18901 ^ went after
18902 ^ him
18903 ^ simon
18904 ^ and those
18906 ^ with him,
18908 ^ and
18909 ^ having found
18910 ^ him,
18911 ^ also
18912 ^ they say
18913 ^ to him
18914 ^ -,
18915 ^ everyone
18916 ^ seeks
18917 ^ you!
18918 ^ and
18919 ^ he says
18920 ^ to them,
18921 ^ let us go
18922 ^ another way
18923 ^ into the
18925 ^ neighboring towns,
18927 ^ so that
18928 ^ also
18929 ^ there
18930 ^ i might preach;
18931 ^ for this
18933 ^ therefore
18934 ^ have i come forth.
18935 ^ and
18936 ^ he was going,
18937 ^ preaching
18938 ^ in the synagogues of them,
18942 ^ in all - galilee,
18946 ^ and
18947 ^ - demons
18949 ^ casting out.
18950 ^ and
18951 ^ comes
18952 ^ to him
18954 ^ a leper,
18955 ^ imploring
18956 ^ him
18957 ^ and
18958 ^ kneeling down to him,
18959 ^ and
18960 ^ saying
18961 ^ to him
18962 ^ -,
18963 ^ if
18964 ^ you are willing,
18965 ^ you are able
18966 ^ me
18967 ^ to cleanse.
18968 ^ and
18969 ^ having been moved with compassion,
18970 ^ having stretched out
18971 ^ the hand of him,
18974 ^ he touched him
18975 ^ and
18976 ^ says
18977 ^ to him,
18978 ^ i am willing;
18979 ^ be you cleansed.
18980 ^ and
18981 ^ immediately
18982 ^ departed
18983 ^ from him
18985 ^ the leprosy,
18987 ^ and
18988 ^ he was cleansed.
18989 ^ and
18990 ^ having sternly warned
18991 ^ him,
18992 ^ immediately
18993 ^ he sent away
18994 ^ him.
18995 ^ and
18996 ^ he says
18997 ^ to him,
18998 ^ see [that]
18999 ^ nothing
19000 ^ to none
19001 ^ you speak.
19002 ^ but
19003 ^ go,
19004 ^ yourself
19005 ^ show
19006 ^ to the priest,
19008 ^ and
19009 ^ offer
19010 ^ for the cleansing of you
19014 ^ what
19015 ^ commanded
19016 ^ moses,
19017 ^ for a testimony to them.
19020 ^ -
19021 ^ and
19022 ^ having gone out,
19023 ^ he began
19024 ^ to proclaim
19025 ^ much
19026 ^ and
19027 ^ to spread abroad
19028 ^ the matter,
19030 ^ so that
19031 ^ no longer
19032 ^ he
19033 ^ was able
19034 ^ openly
19035 ^ into [the] city
19037 ^ to enter;
19038 ^ but
19039 ^ out
19040 ^ in solitary places
19043 ^ he was,
19044 ^ and
19045 ^ they were coming
19046 ^ to him
19048 ^ from every quarter.
19049 ^ and
19050 ^ he having entered
19051 ^ again
19052 ^ into capernaum
19054 ^ after [some] days,
19056 ^ it was heard
19057 ^ that
19058 ^ in [the] house
19060 ^ he is.
19061 ^ and
19062 ^ were gathered together
19063 ^ many,
19064 ^ so that
19065 ^ no more
19066 ^ to have space,
19067 ^ not even
19068 ^ -
19069 ^ at the door;
19072 ^ and
19073 ^ he was speaking
19074 ^ to them
19075 ^ the word.
19077 ^ and
19078 ^ they come,
19079 ^ bringing
19080 ^ to him
19082 ^ a paralytic,
19083 ^ being carried
19084 ^ by four.
19086 ^ and
19087 ^ not
19088 ^ being able
19089 ^ to come near
19090 ^ to him
19091 ^ on account of the crowd,
19094 ^ they removed
19095 ^ the roof
19097 ^ where
19098 ^ he was,
19099 ^ and
19100 ^ having broken up [it],
19101 ^ they let down
19102 ^ the pallet
19104 ^ on which
19105 ^ the paralytic
19107 ^ was lying.
19108 ^ and
19109 ^ having seen
19110 ^ - jesus
19112 ^ the faith of them,
19115 ^ he says
19116 ^ to the paralytic,
19118 ^ son,
19119 ^ are forgiven
19120 ^ of you the sins.
19123 ^ were
19124 ^ now
19125 ^ some
19126 ^ of the scribes
19128 ^ there
19129 ^ sitting
19130 ^ and
19131 ^ reasoning
19132 ^ in the hearts of them,
19136 ^ why
19137 ^ this [man]
19138 ^ thus
19139 ^ does speak?
19140 ^ he blasphemes!
19141 ^ who
19142 ^ is able
19143 ^ to forgive
19144 ^ sins,
19145 ^ if
19146 ^ not
19147 ^ alone
19148 ^ - god?
19150 ^ and
19151 ^ immediately,
19152 ^ having known
19153 ^ - jesus
19155 ^ in the spirit of him
19158 ^ that
19159 ^ thus
19160 ^ they are reasoning
19161 ^ within themselves,
19163 ^ he says
19164 ^ to them,
19165 ^ why
19166 ^ these things
19167 ^ reason you
19168 ^ in the hearts of you?
19172 ^ which
19173 ^ is
19174 ^ easier,
19175 ^ to say
19176 ^ to the paralytic,
19178 ^ are forgiven
19179 ^ of you the sins,
19182 ^ or
19183 ^ to say,
19184 ^ arise,
19185 ^ and
19186 ^ take up
19187 ^ the mat of you,
19190 ^ and
19191 ^ walk
19192 ^ that
19193 ^ however
19194 ^ you might know
19195 ^ that
19196 ^ authority
19197 ^ has
19198 ^ the son
19200 ^ - of man
19202 ^ to forgive
19203 ^ sins
19204 ^ on the earth...
19207 ^ he says
19208 ^ to the paralytic,
19210 ^ to you
19211 ^ i say,
19212 ^ arise,
19213 ^ take up
19214 ^ the mat of you,
19217 ^ and
19218 ^ go
19219 ^ to the home of you.
19223 ^ and
19224 ^ he arose
19225 ^ and
19226 ^ immediately,
19227 ^ having taken up
19228 ^ the mat,
19230 ^ he went forth
19231 ^ before all,
19233 ^ so as for
19234 ^ to be amazed
19235 ^ all,
19236 ^ and
19237 ^ to glorify
19238 ^ - god,
19240 ^ saying
19241 ^ -,
19242 ^ thus
19243 ^ never
19244 ^ did we see.
19245 ^ and
19246 ^ he went forth
19247 ^ again
19248 ^ beside the sea,
19251 ^ and
19252 ^ all the crowd
19255 ^ was coming
19256 ^ to him,
19258 ^ and
19259 ^ he taught
19260 ^ them.
19261 ^ and
19262 ^ passing on,
19263 ^ he saw
19264 ^ levi
19265 ^ the [son]
19266 ^ - of alphaeus
19268 ^ sitting
19269 ^ at the tax booth,
19272 ^ and
19273 ^ he says
19274 ^ to him,
19275 ^ follow
19276 ^ me.
19277 ^ and
19278 ^ having arisen,
19279 ^ he followed
19280 ^ him.
19281 ^ and
19282 ^ it came to pass,
19283 ^ reclining
19284 ^ of him
19285 ^ in the house of him,
19289 ^ that
19290 ^ many tax collectors
19292 ^ and sinners
19294 ^ were reclining with
19295 ^ - jesus
19297 ^ and the disciples of him;
19301 ^ there were
19302 ^ for
19303 ^ many,
19304 ^ and
19305 ^ they were following
19306 ^ him.
19307 ^ and
19308 ^ the scribes
19310 ^ of the pharisees,
19312 ^ having seen
19313 ^ him
19314 ^ eating
19315 ^ with the sinners
19318 ^ and tax collectors,
19320 ^ were saying
19321 ^ to the disciples of him,
19324 ^ why
19325 ^ with the tax collectors
19328 ^ and sinners
19330 ^ does he eat?”
19331 ^ and
19332 ^ having heard,
19333 ^ - jesus
19335 ^ says
19336 ^ to them
19337 ^ -,
19338 ^ no
19339 ^ need
19340 ^ have
19341 ^ those being strong
19343 ^ of a physician,
19344 ^ but
19345 ^ those
19346 ^ sick
19347 ^ being.
19348 ^ not
19349 ^ i came
19350 ^ to call
19351 ^ [the] righteous ,
19352 ^ but
19353 ^ sinners.
19354 ^ and
19355 ^ were
19356 ^ the disciples of john
19359 ^ and the pharisees
19362 ^ fasting.
19363 ^ and
19364 ^ they come
19365 ^ and
19366 ^ say
19367 ^ to him,
19368 ^ because of why
19370 ^ the disciples of john
19373 ^ and the disciples
19376 ^ of the pharisees
19378 ^ fast,
19379 ^ -
19380 ^ but
19381 ^ your disciples
19383 ^ not
19384 ^ fast?
19385 ^ and
19386 ^ said
19387 ^ to them
19388 ^ - jesus,

19394 ^ of the bridechamber,
19396 ^ in which
19398 ^ the bridegroom
19400 ^ with them
19402 ^ is,
19403 ^ to fast?
19404 ^ as long as time
19406 ^ they have
19407 ^ the bridegroom
19409 ^ with them,
19411 ^ not
19412 ^ they are able
19413 ^ to fast.
19414 ^ will come
19415 ^ however
19416 ^ [the] days
19417 ^ when
19418 ^ will have been taken away
19419 ^ from them
19421 ^ the bridegroom,
19423 ^ and
19424 ^ then
19425 ^ they will fast
19426 ^ in those the days.
19430 ^ no one
19431 ^ a patch
19432 ^ of cloth unshrunk
19434 ^ sews
19435 ^ on clothing old;
19438 ^ if
19439 ^ now
19440 ^ not
19441 ^ tears away
19442 ^ the patch
19444 ^ from it,
19446 ^ - new
19448 ^ from the old,
19450 ^ and
19451 ^ worse a tear
19453 ^ takes place.
19454 ^ and
19455 ^ no one
19456 ^ puts
19457 ^ wine new
19459 ^ into wineskins old;
19462 ^ if
19463 ^ now

19474 ^ and
19475 ^ the wineskins.
19477 ^ instead,
19478 ^ wine new
19480 ^ into wineskins new.”
19483 ^ and
19484 ^ it came to pass,
19485 ^ he
19486 ^ on the sabbaths
19489 ^ is passing
19490 ^ through the grainfields,
19493 ^ and
19494 ^ the disciples of him
19497 ^ began
19498 ^ [their] way
19499 ^ to make,
19500 ^ plucking
19501 ^ the heads of grain.
19503 ^ and
19504 ^ the pharisees
19506 ^ were saying
19507 ^ to him,
19508 ^ behold,
19509 ^ why
19510 ^ do they
19511 ^ on the sabbaths
19513 ^ that which
19514 ^ not
19515 ^ is lawful?
19516 ^ and
19517 ^ he said
19518 ^ to them,
19519 ^ never
19520 ^ did you read
19521 ^ what
19522 ^ did
19523 ^ david,
19524 ^ when
19525 ^ need
19526 ^ he had
19527 ^ and
19528 ^ hungered,
19529 ^ he
19530 ^ and those
19532 ^ with him?
19534 ^ how
19535 ^ he entered
19536 ^ into the house
19539 ^ - of god
19541 ^ in [the days of] abiathar the high priest,
19544 ^ and
19545 ^ the loaves
19547 ^ of the presentation
19549 ^ ate,
19550 ^ which
19551 ^ not
19552 ^ it is lawful
19553 ^ to eat,
19554 ^ if
19555 ^ not
19556 ^ for the priests.
19558 ^ and
19559 ^ he gave
19560 ^ even
19561 ^ to those
19562 ^ with him
19564 ^ being?
19565 ^ and
19566 ^ he said
19567 ^ to them,
19568 ^ the sabbath
19570 ^ on account of the man
19573 ^ was made,
19574 ^ and
19575 ^ not
19576 ^ the man
19578 ^ on account of the sabbath.
19581 ^ so then,
19582 ^ lord
19583 ^ is
19584 ^ the son
19586 ^ - of man
19588 ^ also even
19589 ^ of the sabbath.
19591 ^ and
19592 ^ he entered
19593 ^ again
19594 ^ into the synagogue,
19597 ^ and
19598 ^ there was
19599 ^ there
19600 ^ a man,
19601 ^ withered
19602 ^ having
19603 ^ the hand,
19605 ^ and
19606 ^ they were watching
19607 ^ him,
19608 ^ whether
19609 ^ on the sabbaths
19611 ^ he will heal
19612 ^ him,
19613 ^ in order that
19614 ^ they might accuse
19615 ^ him.
19616 ^ and
19617 ^ he says
19618 ^ to the man
19620 ^ -
19621 ^ the withered, hand
19624 ^ having
19625 ^ arise
19626 ^ into the midst.
19629 ^ and
19630 ^ he says
19631 ^ to them,
19632 ^ is it lawful
19633 ^ on the sabbaths
19635 ^ to do good,
19636 ^ or
19637 ^ to do evil?
19638 ^ life
19639 ^ to save,
19640 ^ or
19641 ^ to kill?
19642 ^ -
19643 ^ but
19644 ^ they were silent.
19645 ^ and
19646 ^ having looked around on
19647 ^ them
19648 ^ with anger,
19650 ^ being grieved
19651 ^ at the hardness
19654 ^ of the heart of them,
19657 ^ he says
19658 ^ to the man,
19660 ^ stretch out
19661 ^ the hand
19663 ^ and
19664 ^ he stretched [it] out,
19665 ^ and
19666 ^ was restored
19667 ^ the hand of him.
19670 ^ and
19671 ^ having gone out,
19672 ^ the pharisees
19674 ^ immediately
19675 ^ with the herodians
19678 ^ counsel
19679 ^ began to take
19680 ^ against him,
19682 ^ how
19683 ^ him
19684 ^ they might destroy.
19685 ^ and
19686 ^ - jesus,
19688 ^ with the disciples of him,
19692 ^ withdrew
19693 ^ to the sea,
19696 ^ and
19697 ^ great a multitude
19699 ^ from - galilee
19702 ^ followed,
19703 ^ and from - judea,
19707 ^ and from jerusalem,
19710 ^ and from - idumea,
19714 ^ and beyond
19716 ^ the jordan,
19718 ^ and around tyre
19721 ^ and sidon.
19723 ^ a multitude great,
19725 ^ having heard
19726 ^ how much
19727 ^ he was doing,
19728 ^ came
19729 ^ to him.
19731 ^ and
19732 ^ he spoke
19733 ^ to the disciples of him
19736 ^ that
19737 ^ a boat
19738 ^ might wait upon
19739 ^ him
19740 ^ on account of the crowd,
19743 ^ that
19744 ^ not
19745 ^ they might press upon
19746 ^ him.
19747 ^ many
19748 ^ for
19749 ^ he healed,
19750 ^ so as for
19751 ^ to press upon
19752 ^ him,
19753 ^ that
19754 ^ him
19755 ^ they might touch,
19756 ^ as many as
19757 ^ had
19758 ^ diseases.
19759 ^ and
19760 ^ the spirits
19762 ^ - unclean,
19764 ^ whenever
19765 ^ him
19766 ^ they beheld,
19767 ^ were falling down before
19768 ^ him
19769 ^ and
19770 ^ crying out,
19771 ^ saying
19772 ^ -,
19773 ^ you
19774 ^ are
19775 ^ the son
19777 ^ - of god.
19779 ^ and
19780 ^ much
19781 ^ he would rebuke
19782 ^ them,
19783 ^ so that
19784 ^ not
19785 ^ him
19786 ^ known
19787 ^ they should make.
19788 ^ and
19789 ^ he goes up
19790 ^ on the mountain
19793 ^ and
19794 ^ calls near
19795 ^ those whom
19796 ^ he wanted
19797 ^ himself;
19798 ^ and
19799 ^ they went

20327 ^ perceive;
20328 ^ and
20329 ^ hearing,
20330 ^ they might hear
20331 ^ and

20451 ^ entering in,
20452 ^ choke
20453 ^ the word,
20455 ^ and
20456 ^ unfruitful

20458 ^ and
20459 ^ these

20522 ^ if
20523 ^ anyone
20524 ^ has
20525 ^ ears
20526 ^ to hear,
20527 ^ let him hear.
20528 ^ and
20529 ^ he was saying
20530 ^ to them,
20531 ^ take heed
20532 ^ what
20533 ^ you hear.
20534 ^ with what measure
20537 ^ you measure
20538 ^ it will be measured
20539 ^ to you,

20542 ^ to you.
20543 ^ whoever
20544 ^ for
20545 ^ may have,
20546 ^ it will be given
20547 ^ to him;

20561 ^ is
20562 ^ the kingdom
20564 ^ - of god,
20566 ^ as
20567 ^ a man
20568 ^ should cast
20569 ^ the seed
20571 ^ upon the earth,
20574 ^ and
20575 ^ should sleep
20576 ^ and
20577 ^ rise
20578 ^ night
20579 ^ and day,
20581 ^ and
20582 ^ the seed
20584 ^ should sprout
20585 ^ and
20586 ^ grow;
20587 ^ how
20588 ^ not
20589 ^ knows
20590 ^ he.
20591 ^ of itself,
20592 ^ the earth
20594 ^ brings forth fruit —
20595 ^ first
20596 ^ a plant,
20597 ^ then
20598 ^ an ear,
20599 ^ then
20600 ^ full grain
20602 ^ in the ear.
20605 ^ when
20606 ^ then
20607 ^ offers itself
20608 ^ the fruit,
20610 ^ immediately
20611 ^ he sends
20612 ^ the sickle,
20614 ^ for
20615 ^ has come
20616 ^ the harvest.
20618 ^ and
20619 ^ he was saying,
20620 ^ to what
20621 ^ shall we liken
20622 ^ the kingdom
20624 ^ - of god?
20626 ^ or
20627 ^ in what
20629 ^ it
20630 ^ parable
20631 ^ shall we present?
20632 ^ as to a grain of mustard,
20635 ^ which,
20636 ^ when
20637 ^ it has been sown
20638 ^ upon the earth,
20641 ^ smallest
20642 ^ is
20643 ^ of all the seeds
20646 ^ which [are]
20647 ^ upon the earth,
20650 ^ and
20651 ^ when
20652 ^ it has been sown,
20653 ^ it grows up
20654 ^ and
20655 ^ becomes
20656 ^ greater
20657 ^ than all the garden plants,
20660 ^ and
20661 ^ it produces
20662 ^ branches great,
20664 ^ so that
20665 ^ are able
20666 ^ under the shadow of it
20670 ^ the birds
20672 ^ of the air
20674 ^ to perch.
20675 ^ and
20676 ^ with such parables many,
20679 ^ he kept speaking
20680 ^ to them
20681 ^ the word,
20683 ^ as
20684 ^ they were able
20685 ^ to hear.
20686 ^ without
20687 ^ then
20688 ^ parables,
20689 ^ not
20690 ^ would he speak
20691 ^ to them;
20692 ^ in private
20694 ^ however,
20695 ^ to his own disciples
20698 ^ he would explain
20699 ^ all things.
20700 ^ and
20701 ^ he says
20702 ^ to them
20703 ^ on that - day,
20707 ^ evening
20708 ^ having come,
20709 ^ let us pass over
20710 ^ to the other side.
20713 ^ and
20714 ^ having dismissed
20715 ^ the crowd,
20717 ^ they take with [them]
20718 ^ him
20719 ^ since
20720 ^ he was
20721 ^ in the boat;
20724 ^ also
20725 ^ other boats
20727 ^ were
20728 ^ with him.
20730 ^ and
20731 ^ comes
20732 ^ a storm violent of wind,
20735 ^ and
20736 ^ the waves
20738 ^ were breaking
20739 ^ over the boat,
20742 ^ so that
20743 ^ already
20744 ^ is being filled up
20745 ^ the boat.
20747 ^ and
20748 ^ he
20749 ^ was
20750 ^ in the stern,
20753 ^ on the cushion
20756 ^ sleeping.
20757 ^ and

20763 ^ teacher,
20764 ^ not
20765 ^ is it concern
20766 ^ to you
20767 ^ that
20768 ^ we perish?
20769 ^ and
20770 ^ having been awoken
20771 ^ he rebuked
20772 ^ the wind
20774 ^ and
20775 ^ said
20776 ^ to the sea,
20778 ^ silence,
20779 ^ be still.
20780 ^ and
20781 ^ abated
20782 ^ the wind,
20784 ^ and
20785 ^ there was
20786 ^ a calm great.
20788 ^ and
20789 ^ he said
20790 ^ to them,
20791 ^ why
20792 ^ fearful
20793 ^ are you?
20794 ^ still not
20795 ^ have you
20796 ^ faith?
20797 ^ and
20798 ^ they feared
20799 ^ [with] fear great,
20801 ^ and
20802 ^ were saying
20803 ^ to each other,
20805 ^ who
20806 ^ then
20807 ^ this
20808 ^ is,
20809 ^ that
20810 ^ even
20811 ^ the wind
20813 ^ and the sea

20820 ^ to the other side
20823 ^ of the sea,
20825 ^ to the region
20828 ^ of the gerasenes.
20830 ^ and

20857 ^ anyone
20858 ^ was able
20859 ^ him
20860 ^ to bind,
20861 ^ because that
20863 ^ he
20864 ^ often
20865 ^ with shackles
20866 ^ and chains
20868 ^ had been bound,
20869 ^ and

20890 ^ in the tombs
20893 ^ and in the mountains
20897 ^ he was
20898 ^ crying out
20899 ^ and
20900 ^ cutting
20901 ^ himself
20902 ^ with stones.
20903 ^ and
20904 ^ having seen
20905 ^ - jesus
20907 ^ from afar,
20909 ^ he ran
20910 ^ and
20911 ^ fell on his knees
20912 ^ before him.
20913 ^ and
20914 ^ having cried
20915 ^ in a voice loud,
20917 ^ he said,
20918 ^ what
20919 ^ to me

20938 ^ you come forth,
20939 ^ the spirit
20941 ^ - unclean,
20943 ^ out of the man!
20946 ^ and
20947 ^ he was asking
20948 ^ him,
20949 ^ what [is]
20950 ^ [the] name
20951 ^ of you?
20952 ^ and
20953 ^ saying,
20954 ^ he answered,
20955 ^ legion
20956 ^ [is] name
20957 ^ to me,
20958 ^ because
20959 ^ many
20960 ^ we are.
20961 ^ and
20962 ^ he begged
20963 ^ him
20964 ^ numerous times
20965 ^ that
20966 ^ not
20967 ^ them
20968 ^ he would send

20972 ^ there was
20973 ^ now
20974 ^ there,
20975 ^ near the mountain,
20978 ^ a herd of pigs great
20981 ^ feeding.
20982 ^ and
20983 ^ they begged
20984 ^ him,
20985 ^ saying,
20986 ^ send
20987 ^ us
20988 ^ into the pigs,
20991 ^ so that
20992 ^ into them
20994 ^ we may enter.
20995 ^ and
20996 ^ he allowed
20997 ^ them.
20998 ^ and
20999 ^ having gone out,
21000 ^ the spirits
21002 ^ - unclean
21004 ^ entered
21005 ^ into the pigs,
21008 ^ and
21009 ^ rushed
21010 ^ the herd
21012 ^ down the steep bank
21015 ^ into the sea,
21018 ^ about two thousand,
21020 ^ and
21021 ^ they were drowned
21022 ^ in the sea.
21025 ^ and
21026 ^ those feeding
21028 ^ them
21029 ^ fled
21030 ^ and
21031 ^ proclaimed [it]
21032 ^ to the city
21035 ^ and to the country.
21039 ^ and
21040 ^ they went out
21041 ^ to see
21042 ^ what
21043 ^ it is
21044 ^ that has been done.
21046 ^ and
21047 ^ they come
21048 ^ to - jesus
21051 ^ and

21070 ^ how
21071 ^ it happened
21072 ^ to the [one] being possessed by demons,
21074 ^ and
21075 ^ concerning the pigs.
21078 ^ and
21079 ^ they began
21080 ^ to implore
21081 ^ him
21082 ^ to depart
21083 ^ from the region of them.
21087 ^ and
21088 ^ having entered
21089 ^ he
21090 ^ into the boat,
21093 ^ was begging
21094 ^ him
21095 ^ the [one] having been possessed by demons,
21097 ^ that
21098 ^ with him
21100 ^ he might be.

22205 ^ they say,
22206 ^ five,
22207 ^ and two fish.
22210 ^ and
22211 ^ he commanded

22213 ^ to make recline
22214 ^ all,
22215 ^ groups [by] groups
22217 ^ on the green grass.
22221 ^ and
22222 ^ they sat down
22223 ^ groups [by] groups,
22225 ^ by hundreds
22227 ^ and by fifties.
22230 ^ and
22231 ^ having taken
22232 ^ the five loaves
22235 ^ and the two fish,
22239 ^ having looked up
22240 ^ to the heaven,
22243 ^ he blessed
22244 ^ and
22245 ^ broke
22246 ^ the loaves,
22248 ^ and
22249 ^ he kept giving [them]
22250 ^ to the disciples of him
22253 ^ that
22254 ^ they might set before
22255 ^ them.

22278 ^ were
22279 ^ those having eaten of
22281 ^ the loaves
22283 ^ five thousand men.
22285 ^ and
22286 ^ immediately
22287 ^ he compelled
22288 ^ the disciples of him
22291 ^ to enter
22292 ^ into the boat
22295 ^ and
22296 ^ to go before
22297 ^ to the other side,
22300 ^ to bethsaida,
22302 ^ until
22303 ^ he
22304 ^ should dismiss
22305 ^ the crowd.
22307 ^ and
22308 ^ having taken leave of
22309 ^ them,
22310 ^ he departed
22311 ^ into the mountain
22314 ^ to pray.
22315 ^ and

22350 ^ to them,
22352 ^ walking
22353 ^ on the sea,
22356 ^ and
22357 ^ he was wishing
22358 ^ to pass by
22359 ^ them.
22360 ^ -
22361 ^ and

22407 ^ in abundance
22409 ^ in themselves
22411 ^ they were amazed,

22569 ^ him
22570 ^ the pharisees
22572 ^ and the scribes,
22575 ^ because of why
22577 ^ not
22578 ^ walk
22579 ^ the disciples of you
22582 ^ according to the tradition
22585 ^ of the elders,
22587 ^ but
22588 ^ with unwashed hands
22590 ^ eat
22591 ^ the bread?
22593 ^ -
22594 ^ and
22595 ^ he said
22596 ^ to them,
22597 ^ rightly
22598 ^ prophesied
22599 ^ isaiah
22600 ^ concerning you
22602 ^ - hypocrites,
22604 ^ as
22605 ^ it has been written
22606 ^ -:
22607 ^ this - people
22610 ^ with the lips
22612 ^ me
22613 ^ honors,
22614 ^ -
22615 ^ but
22616 ^ the heart of them
22618 ^ far away
22619 ^ is kept
22620 ^ from me.
22622 ^ in vain
22623 ^ now
22624 ^ they worship
22625 ^ me,
22626 ^ teaching
22627 ^ [as] doctrines [the] precepts of men.’
22630 ^ having neglected
22631 ^ the commandment
22633 ^ - of god,
22635 ^ you hold
22636 ^ to the tradition
22638 ^ - of men.”
22640 ^ and
22641 ^ he was saying
22642 ^ to them,
22643 ^ neatly
22644 ^ do you set aside
22645 ^ the commandment
22647 ^ - of god,
22649 ^ that
22650 ^ the tradition of you,
22653 ^ you might keep.
22654 ^ moses
22655 ^ for
22656 ^ said,
22657 ^ honor
22658 ^ the father of you
22661 ^ and the mother of you,’
22665 ^ and,
22666 ^ the [one] speaking evil of
22668 ^ father
22669 ^ or mother,
22671 ^ in death
22672 ^ must end.’
22673 ^ you
22674 ^ however
22675 ^ say [that]
22676 ^ if
22677 ^ says
22678 ^ a man
22679 ^ to the father
22681 ^ or the mother,
22684 ^ [it is] corban,
22685 ^ that
22686 ^ is,
22687 ^ a gift,
22688 ^ whatever
22689 ^ if
22690 ^ from me
22692 ^ you might be profited,
22693 ^ no longer
22694 ^ do you allow
22695 ^ him
22696 ^ anything
22697 ^ to do
22698 ^ for the father
22700 ^ or the mother,
22703 ^ making void
22704 ^ the word
22706 ^ - of god
22708 ^ for the tradition of you
22711 ^ which
22712 ^ you have handed down.
22713 ^ and
22714 ^ like [things] such many
22717 ^ you do.
22718 ^ and
22719 ^ having called to [him]
22720 ^ again
22721 ^ the crowd,
22723 ^ he was saying
22724 ^ to them,
22725 ^ listen to
22726 ^ me,
22727 ^ all,
22728 ^ and
22729 ^ understand:
22730 ^ nothing
22731 ^ there is
22732 ^ from outside the man
22735 ^ entering
22736 ^ into him,
22738 ^ which
22739 ^ is able
22740 ^ to defile
22741 ^ him;
22742 ^ but
22743 ^ the things
22744 ^ out of the man
22747 ^ proceeding
22748 ^ are
22749 ^ the things defiling
22751 ^ the man.”
22753 ^ and
22754 ^ when
22755 ^ he went
22756 ^ into [the] house
22758 ^ from the crowd,
22761 ^ were asking
22762 ^ him
22763 ^ the disciples of him
22766 ^ the parable.
22768 ^ and
22769 ^ he says
22770 ^ to them,
22771 ^ thus
22772 ^ also
22773 ^ you
22774 ^ without understanding
22775 ^ are?
22776 ^ not
22777 ^ understand you
22778 ^ that
22779 ^ everything -
22781 ^ from outside
22782 ^ entering
22783 ^ into the man,
22786 ^ not
22787 ^ is able
22788 ^ him
22789 ^ to defile,
22790 ^ because
22791 ^ not
22792 ^ it enters
22793 ^ of him into the heart,
22797 ^ but into the belly,
22801 ^ and
22802 ^ into the sewer
22805 ^ goes out?”
22806 ^ purifying
22807 ^ all the food.
22810 ^ he was saying
22811 ^ now
22812 ^ -,
22813 ^ that
22814 ^ out of the man
22817 ^ going forth,
22818 ^ that
22819 ^ defiles
22820 ^ the man.
22822 ^ within
22823 ^ for
22824 ^ from the heart
22827 ^ - of men
22829 ^ - thoughts
22831 ^ - evil
22833 ^ go forth,
22834 ^ sexual immorality, thefts, murders, adulteries, covetous desires, wickednesses, deceit, sensuality,
22842 ^ an eye evil, slander, pride, foolishness.
22847 ^ all these - evils
22851 ^ from within
22852 ^ go forth,
22853 ^ and
22854 ^ they defile
22855 ^ the man.
22857 ^ from there
22858 ^ also
22859 ^ having risen up,
22860 ^ he went away
22861 ^ into the region of tyre.
22865 ^ and
22866 ^ having entered
22867 ^ into a house,
22869 ^ no one
22870 ^ he was wishing
22871 ^ to know [it],
22872 ^ and
22873 ^ not
22874 ^ he was able
22875 ^ to be hidden.
22876 ^ but
22877 ^ immediately
22878 ^ having heard
22879 ^ a woman
22880 ^ about him,
22882 ^ of whom
22883 ^ had
22884 ^ the little daughter
22886 ^ of her
22887 ^ spirit unclean,
22889 ^ having come,
22890 ^ fell
22891 ^ at the feet of him.
22895 ^ -
22896 ^ now
22897 ^ the woman
22898 ^ was
22899 ^ gentile,
22900 ^ syrophoenician
22901 ^ by race,
22903 ^ and
22904 ^ kept asking
22905 ^ him
22906 ^ that
22907 ^ the demon
22909 ^ he should cast forth
22910 ^ out of the daughter of her.
22914 ^ and
22915 ^ he was saying
22916 ^ to her,
22917 ^ permit
22918 ^ first
22919 ^ to be satisfied
22920 ^ the children;
22922 ^ not
22923 ^ for
22924 ^ it is
22925 ^ good
22926 ^ to take
22927 ^ the bread
22929 ^ of the children,
22931 ^ and
22932 ^ to the dogs
22934 ^ to cast [it].
22935 ^ -
22936 ^ but
22937 ^ she answered
22938 ^ and
22939 ^ says
22940 ^ to him,
22941 ^ lord;
22942 ^ even
22943 ^ the dogs
22945 ^ under the table
22948 ^ eat
22949 ^ of the crumbs
22952 ^ of the children.
22954 ^ and
22955 ^ he said
22956 ^ to her,
22957 ^ because of this - word,
22961 ^ go;
22962 ^ has gone forth
22963 ^ out of the daughter of you
22967 ^ the demon.
22969 ^ and
22970 ^ having gone away
22971 ^ to the home of her,
22975 ^ she found
22976 ^ the child
22978 ^ lying
22979 ^ on the bed,
22982 ^ and the demon
22985 ^ having gone out.
22986 ^ and
22987 ^ again
22988 ^ having departed
22989 ^ from the region of tyre,
22993 ^ he came
22994 ^ through sidon,
22996 ^ to the sea
22999 ^ - of galilee
23001 ^ through [the] midst
23003 ^ of the region of [the] decapolis.
23006 ^ and
23007 ^ they bring
23008 ^ to him
23009 ^ a deaf man
23010 ^ and who spoke with difficulty,
23012 ^ and
23013 ^ they implore
23014 ^ him
23015 ^ that
23016 ^ he might lay
23017 ^ on him
23018 ^ the hand.
23020 ^ and
23021 ^ having taken away
23022 ^ him
23023 ^ from the crowd
23026 ^ aside privately,
23028 ^ he put
23029 ^ the fingers of him
23032 ^ to the ears of him,
23036 ^ and
23037 ^ having spit,
23038 ^ he touched
23039 ^ the tongue of him,
23042 ^ and
23043 ^ having looked up
23044 ^ to - heaven
23047 ^ he sighed deeply,
23048 ^ and
23049 ^ he says
23050 ^ to him,
23051 ^ ephphatha!
23052 ^ that
23053 ^ is,
23054 ^ be opened!”
23055 ^ and
23056 ^ immediately
23057 ^ were opened
23058 ^ his - ears,
23061 ^ and
23062 ^ was loosed
23063 ^ the band
23065 ^ of the tongue of him,
23068 ^ and
23069 ^ he began speaking
23070 ^ plainly.
23071 ^ and
23072 ^ he instructed
23073 ^ them
23074 ^ that
23075 ^ no one
23076 ^ they should tell.
23077 ^ as much as
23078 ^ however
23079 ^ he
23080 ^ kept instructing
23081 ^ them,
23082 ^ more abundantly
23084 ^ they were proclaiming [it].
23085 ^ and
23086 ^ above measure
23087 ^ they were astonished,
23088 ^ saying,
23089 ^ well
23090 ^ all things
23091 ^ he has done;
23092 ^ both
23093 ^ the deaf
23095 ^ he makes
23096 ^ to hear,
23097 ^ and
23098 ^ the mute
23100 ^ to speak.
23101 ^ in those - days,
23105 ^ again
23106 ^ great [the] crowd
23108 ^ being
23109 ^ and
23110 ^ not
23111 ^ having
23112 ^ what
23113 ^ they might eat,
23114 ^ having called to [him]
23115 ^ the disciples,
23117 ^ he says
23118 ^ to them,
23119 ^ i am moved with compassion
23120 ^ upon the crowd,
23123 ^ because
23124 ^ already
23125 ^ days three
23127 ^ they continue
23128 ^ with me,
23129 ^ and
23130 ^ nothing
23131 ^ have
23132 ^ that
23133 ^ they might eat.
23134 ^ and
23135 ^ if
23136 ^ i shall send away
23137 ^ them
23138 ^ hungry
23139 ^ to [the] homes of them,
23142 ^ they will faint
23143 ^ on the way.
23146 ^ for
23147 ^ some of them
23149 ^ from afar
23151 ^ are come.
23152 ^ and
23153 ^ answered
23154 ^ him
23155 ^ the disciples of him
23158 ^ -,
23159 ^ from where
23160 ^ these
23161 ^ will be able
23162 ^ anyone
23163 ^ here
23164 ^ to satisfy
23165 ^ with bread
23166 ^ in this desolate place?
23168 ^ and
23169 ^ he was asking
23170 ^ them,
23171 ^ how many
23172 ^ have you
23173 ^ loaves?
23174 ^ -
23175 ^ and
23176 ^ they said,
23177 ^ seven.
23178 ^ and
23179 ^ he directs
23180 ^ the crowd
23182 ^ to recline
23183 ^ on the ground.
23186 ^ and
23187 ^ having taken
23188 ^ the seven loaves,
23191 ^ having given thanks,
23192 ^ he broke [them]
23193 ^ and
23194 ^ kept giving [them]
23195 ^ to disciples of him,
23198 ^ that
23199 ^ they might set before [them].
23200 ^ and
23201 ^ they set [it] before
23202 ^ the crowd.
23204 ^ and
23205 ^ they had
23206 ^ small fish a few.
23208 ^ and
23209 ^ having blessed
23210 ^ them,
23211 ^ he ordered
23212 ^ also
23213 ^ these
23214 ^ to be set before [them].
23215 ^ and
23216 ^ they ate
23217 ^ and
23218 ^ were satisfied.
23219 ^ and
23220 ^ they took up
23221 ^ over and above of fragments
23223 ^ seven baskets.
23225 ^ there were
23226 ^ now
23227 ^ about four thousand.
23229 ^ and
23230 ^ he sent away
23231 ^ them.
23232 ^ and
23233 ^ immediately
23234 ^ having entered
23235 ^ into the boat
23238 ^ with the disciples of him,
23242 ^ he came
23243 ^ into the district of dalmanutha.
23247 ^ and
23248 ^ went out
23249 ^ the pharisees
23251 ^ and
23252 ^ began
23253 ^ to dispute with
23254 ^ him,
23255 ^ seeking
23256 ^ from him
23258 ^ a sign
23259 ^ from - heaven,
23262 ^ testing
23263 ^ him.
23264 ^ and
23265 ^ having sighed deeply
23266 ^ in the spirit of him,
23269 ^ he says,
23270 ^ why
23271 ^ the generation this
23274 ^ seeks
23275 ^ a sign?
23276 ^ truly
23277 ^ i say
23278 ^ to you,
23279 ^ if
23280 ^ there will be given
23281 ^ to the generation this
23284 ^ a sign.
23285 ^ and
23286 ^ having left
23287 ^ them,
23288 ^ again
23289 ^ having embarked,
23290 ^ he went away
23291 ^ to the other side.
23294 ^ and
23295 ^ they forgot
23296 ^ to take
23297 ^ loaves,
23298 ^ and
23299 ^ if
23300 ^ not
23301 ^ one loaf
23303 ^ not
23304 ^ they had
23305 ^ with them
23307 ^ in the boat.
23310 ^ and
23311 ^ he was instructing
23312 ^ them,
23313 ^ saying,
23314 ^ watch out;
23315 ^ take heed
23316 ^ of the leaven
23319 ^ of the pharisees,
23321 ^ and of the leaven of herod.
23325 ^ and
23326 ^ they were reasoning
23327 ^ with one another
23329 ^ because
23330 ^ loaves
23331 ^ not
23332 ^ they have.
23333 ^ and
23334 ^ having known [it],
23335 ^ he says
23336 ^ to them,
23337 ^ why
23338 ^ reason you
23339 ^ because
23340 ^ loaves
23341 ^ not
23342 ^ you have?
23343 ^ not yet
23344 ^ do you perceive
23345 ^ nor
23346 ^ understand?
23347 ^ hardened
23348 ^ do you have
23349 ^ the heart of you?
23352 ^ eyes
23353 ^ having,
23354 ^ not
23355 ^ do you see?
23356 ^ and
23357 ^ ears
23358 ^ having,
23359 ^ not
23360 ^ do you hear?
23361 ^ and
23362 ^ not
23363 ^ do you remember?
23364 ^ when
23365 ^ the five loaves
23368 ^ i broke
23369 ^ for the five thousand,
23372 ^ how many hand-baskets
23374 ^ of fragments full
23376 ^ took you up?
23377 ^ they say
23378 ^ to him,
23379 ^ twelve.
23380 ^ when
23381 ^ the seven
23383 ^ to the four thousand,
23386 ^ of how many baskets [the] fillings
23389 ^ of fragments
23390 ^ took you up?
23391 ^ and
23392 ^ said
23393 ^ they,
23394 ^ seven.
23395 ^ and
23396 ^ he was saying
23397 ^ to them,
23398 ^ not yet
23399 ^ do you understand?
23400 ^ and
23401 ^ they come
23402 ^ to bethsaida.
23404 ^ and
23405 ^ they bring
23406 ^ to him
23407 ^ a blind [man],
23408 ^ and
23409 ^ implore
23410 ^ him
23411 ^ that
23412 ^ him
23413 ^ he might touch.
23414 ^ and
23415 ^ having taken hold of
23416 ^ the hand
23418 ^ of the blind [man],
23420 ^ he led forth
23421 ^ him
23422 ^ out of the village,
23425 ^ and
23426 ^ having spit
23427 ^ upon the eyes of him,
23431 ^ having laid
23432 ^ the hands
23434 ^ upon him,
23435 ^ he was asking
23436 ^ him
23437 ^ if
23438 ^ anything
23439 ^ you see.
23440 ^ and
23441 ^ having looked up
23442 ^ he was saying,
23443 ^ i see
23444 ^ the men,
23446 ^ for
23447 ^ as trees
23449 ^ i see [them]
23450 ^ walking.
23451 ^ then
23452 ^ again
23453 ^ he laid
23454 ^ the hands
23456 ^ upon the eyes of him,
23460 ^ and
23461 ^ he opened his eyes
23462 ^ and
23463 ^ he was restored,
23464 ^ and
23465 ^ he began to see
23466 ^ clearly
23467 ^ everything.
23468 ^ and
23469 ^ he sent
23470 ^ him
23471 ^ to [the] home of him,
23474 ^ saying,
23475 ^ not
23476 ^ into the village
23479 ^ may you enter.”
23480 ^ and
23481 ^ went forth
23482 ^ - jesus
23484 ^ and the disciples of him
23488 ^ into the villages
23491 ^ of caesarea
23492 ^ - philippi.
23494 ^ and
23495 ^ on the way,
23498 ^ he was questioning
23499 ^ the disciples of him,
23502 ^ saying
23503 ^ to them,
23504 ^ whom
23505 ^ me
23506 ^ do pronounce
23507 ^ - men
23509 ^ to be?
23510 ^ -
23511 ^ and
23512 ^ they answered
23513 ^ him,
23514 ^ saying
23515 ^ -,
23516 ^ john
23517 ^ the baptist;
23519 ^ and
23520 ^ others,
23521 ^ elijah;
23522 ^ others
23523 ^ now
23524 ^ -,
23525 ^ one
23526 ^ of the prophets.
23528 ^ and
23529 ^ he
23530 ^ was questioning
23531 ^ them,
23532 ^ you
23533 ^ however,
23534 ^ whom
23535 ^ me
23536 ^ do pronounce
23537 ^ to be?
23538 ^ answering,
23539 ^ - peter
23541 ^ says
23542 ^ to him,
23543 ^ you
23544 ^ are
23545 ^ the christ.
23547 ^ and
23548 ^ he warned
23549 ^ them
23550 ^ that
23551 ^ no one
23552 ^ they should tell
23553 ^ concerning him.
23555 ^ and
23556 ^ he began
23557 ^ to teach
23558 ^ them
23559 ^ that
23560 ^ it is necessary for
23561 ^ the son
23563 ^ - of man
23565 ^ many things
23566 ^ to suffer,
23567 ^ and
23568 ^ to be rejected
23569 ^ by the elders
23572 ^ and the chief priests
23575 ^ and the scribes,
23578 ^ and
23579 ^ to be killed,
23580 ^ and
23581 ^ after three days
23584 ^ to rise [again].
23585 ^ and
23586 ^ openly
23587 ^ the word
23589 ^ he was speaking.
23590 ^ and
23591 ^ having taken him
23592 ^ - peter
23594 ^ to him,
23595 ^ he began
23596 ^ to rebuke
23597 ^ him.
23598 ^ -
23599 ^ and
23600 ^ having turned
23601 ^ and
23602 ^ having looked upon
23603 ^ the disciples of him,
23606 ^ he rebuked
23607 ^ peter
23608 ^ and
23609 ^ said,
23610 ^ get
23611 ^ behind me,
23613 ^ satan,
23614 ^ for
23615 ^ not
23616 ^ you have in mind
23617 ^ the
23618 ^ things of god,
23620 ^ but
23621 ^ the
23622 ^ things of men.
23624 ^ and
23625 ^ having called to [him]
23626 ^ the crowd
23628 ^ with the disciples of him,
23632 ^ he said
23633 ^ to them,
23634 ^ if
23635 ^ anyone
23636 ^ desires
23637 ^ after me
23639 ^ to follow,
23640 ^ let him deny
23641 ^ himself,
23642 ^ and
23643 ^ let him take up
23644 ^ the cross of him,
23647 ^ and
23648 ^ let him follow
23649 ^ me.
23650 ^ whoever
23651 ^ for
23652 ^ if
23653 ^ might desire
23654 ^ - life his
23657 ^ to save,
23658 ^ will lose
23659 ^ it;
23660 ^ whoever
23661 ^ now
23662 ^ -
23663 ^ will lose
23664 ^ the life of him
23667 ^ on account of me
23669 ^ and of the gospel,
23672 ^ he will save
23673 ^ it.
23674 ^ what
23675 ^ for
23676 ^ does it profit
23677 ^ a man
23678 ^ to gain
23679 ^ the world whole
23682 ^ and
23683 ^ to lose
23684 ^ the soul of him?
23687 ^ what
23688 ^ for
23689 ^ shall give
23690 ^ a man
23691 ^ [as] an exchange
23692 ^ for the soul of him?
23695 ^ whoever
23696 ^ for
23697 ^ if
23698 ^ may be ashamed of
23699 ^ me
23700 ^ and - my words
23704 ^ in the generation
23707 ^ this
23708 ^ - adulterous
23710 ^ and sinful,
23712 ^ also
23713 ^ the son
23715 ^ - of man
23717 ^ will be ashamed of
23718 ^ him
23719 ^ when
23720 ^ he shall come
23721 ^ in the glory
23724 ^ of the father of him,
23727 ^ with the angels
23730 ^ - holy.
23732 ^ and
23733 ^ he was saying
23734 ^ to them,
23735 ^ truly
23736 ^ i say
23737 ^ to you
23738 ^ that
23739 ^ there are
23740 ^ some
23741 ^ here
23742 ^ of those standing,
23744 ^ who
23745 ^ no not
23747 ^ shall taste
23748 ^ of death,
23749 ^ until
23750 ^ -
23751 ^ they see
23752 ^ the kingdom
23754 ^ - of god
23756 ^ having come
23757 ^ with power.
23759 ^ and
23760 ^ after days six
23763 ^ takes along
23764 ^ - jesus,
23766 ^ - peter
23768 ^ and - james
23771 ^ and - john,
23774 ^ and
23775 ^ brings up
23776 ^ them
23777 ^ into a mountain high
23780 ^ apart themselves
23782 ^ alone.
23783 ^ and
23784 ^ he was transfigured
23785 ^ before them,
23787 ^ and
23788 ^ the garments of him
23791 ^ became
23792 ^ shining white exceedingly,
23795 ^ such as
23796 ^ a launderer
23797 ^ on the earth
23800 ^ not
23801 ^ is able
23802 ^ thus
23803 ^ to whiten.
23804 ^ and
23805 ^ appeared
23806 ^ to them
23807 ^ elijah
23808 ^ with moses,
23810 ^ and
23811 ^ they were
23812 ^ talking with
23813 ^ - jesus.
23815 ^ and
23816 ^ answering,
23817 ^ - peter
23819 ^ says
23820 ^ - to jesus,
23822 ^ rabbi,
23823 ^ good
23824 ^ it is
23825 ^ for us
23826 ^ here
23827 ^ to be.
23828 ^ and
23829 ^ let us make
23830 ^ three tabernacles:
23832 ^ for you one,
23834 ^ and for moses one,
23837 ^ and for elijah one.
23840 ^ not
23841 ^ for
23842 ^ he knew
23843 ^ what
23844 ^ he should say;
23845 ^ terrified
23846 ^ for
23847 ^ they were.
23848 ^ and
23849 ^ there came
23850 ^ a cloud
23851 ^ overshadowing
23852 ^ them,
23853 ^ and
23854 ^ there came
23855 ^ a voice
23856 ^ out of the cloud:
23859 ^ this
23860 ^ is
23861 ^ the son of me,
23864 ^ the beloved;
23866 ^ listen you
23867 ^ to him.
23868 ^ and
23869 ^ suddenly,
23870 ^ having looked around,
23871 ^ no longer
23872 ^ no one
23873 ^ they saw
23874 ^ except
23875 ^ - jesus
23877 ^ alone
23878 ^ with them.
23880 ^ and
23881 ^ descending
23882 ^ of them
23883 ^ from the mountain,
23886 ^ he instructed
23887 ^ them
23888 ^ that
23889 ^ to no one
23890 ^ what
23891 ^ they had seen
23892 ^ they should tell,
23893 ^ if
23894 ^ not
23895 ^ until
23896 ^ the son
23898 ^ - of man
23900 ^ out from [the] dead
23902 ^ had risen.
23903 ^ and
23904 ^ that saying
23906 ^ they kept
23907 ^ among themselves,
23909 ^ questioning
23910 ^ what
23911 ^ it is
23912 ^ -
23913 ^ out from the dead
23915 ^ to rise.
23916 ^ and
23917 ^ they were asking
23918 ^ him,
23919 ^ saying
23920 ^ -,
23921 ^ say
23922 ^ the scribes
23924 ^ that
23925 ^ elijah
23926 ^ it behooves
23927 ^ to come
23928 ^ first?
23929 ^ -
23930 ^ and
23931 ^ he was saying
23932 ^ to them,
23933 ^ elijah
23934 ^ indeed
23935 ^ having come
23936 ^ first,
23937 ^ restores
23938 ^ all things;
23939 ^ and
23940 ^ how
23941 ^ has it been written
23942 ^ of the son
23945 ^ - of man,
23947 ^ that
23948 ^ many things
23949 ^ he should suffer
23950 ^ and
23951 ^ be set at naught?
23952 ^ but
23953 ^ i say
23954 ^ to you,
23955 ^ that
23956 ^ also
23957 ^ elijah
23958 ^ has come,
23959 ^ and
23960 ^ they did
23961 ^ to him
23962 ^ whatever
23963 ^ they desired,
23964 ^ as
23965 ^ it has been written
23966 ^ of him.
23968 ^ and
23969 ^ having come
23970 ^ to the disciples,
23973 ^ they saw
23974 ^ a crowd great
23976 ^ around them,
23978 ^ and scribes
23980 ^ arguing
23981 ^ with them.
23983 ^ and
23984 ^ immediately
23985 ^ all the crowd,
23988 ^ having seen
23989 ^ him,
23990 ^ were greatly amazed,
23991 ^ and
23992 ^ running to [him],
23993 ^ were greeting
23994 ^ him.
23995 ^ and
23996 ^ he asked
23997 ^ them,
23998 ^ what
23999 ^ are you disputing
24000 ^ with them?
24002 ^ and
24003 ^ answered
24004 ^ him
24005 ^ one
24006 ^ out of the crowd,
24009 ^ teacher,
24010 ^ i brought
24011 ^ the son of me
24014 ^ to you,
24016 ^ having
24017 ^ a spirit mute;
24019 ^ and
24020 ^ whenever
24021 ^ if
24022 ^ him
24023 ^ it seizes,
24024 ^ it throws down
24025 ^ him;
24026 ^ and
24027 ^ he foams,
24028 ^ and
24029 ^ gnashes
24030 ^ - his teeth,
24032 ^ and
24033 ^ is withering away.
24034 ^ and
24035 ^ i spoke
24036 ^ to the disciples of you,
24039 ^ that
24040 ^ it
24041 ^ they might cast out,
24042 ^ and
24043 ^ not
24044 ^ they had power.
24045 ^ -
24046 ^ and
24047 ^ answering
24048 ^ him,
24049 ^ he says,
24050 ^ o
24051 ^ generation unbelieving!
24053 ^ until when
24055 ^ with you
24057 ^ will i be?
24058 ^ until when
24060 ^ will i bear with
24061 ^ you?
24062 ^ bring
24063 ^ him
24064 ^ to me.
24066 ^ and
24067 ^ they brought
24068 ^ him
24069 ^ to him.
24071 ^ and
24072 ^ having seen
24073 ^ him,
24074 ^ the spirit
24076 ^ immediately
24077 ^ threw into convulsions
24078 ^ him,
24079 ^ and
24080 ^ having fallen
24081 ^ upon the ground,
24084 ^ he began rolling around,
24085 ^ foaming.
24086 ^ and
24087 ^ he asked
24088 ^ the father of him,
24091 ^ how long
24092 ^ a time
24093 ^ is it
24094 ^ that
24095 ^ this
24096 ^ has been
24097 ^ with him?
24098 ^ -
24099 ^ and
24100 ^ he said,
24101 ^ from childhood.
24103 ^ and
24104 ^ often
24105 ^ both into fire
24108 ^ him
24109 ^ it casts,
24110 ^ and into waters,
24113 ^ that
24114 ^ it might destroy
24115 ^ him.
24116 ^ but
24117 ^ if
24118 ^ anything
24119 ^ you are able [to do],
24120 ^ help
24121 ^ us,
24122 ^ having compassion
24123 ^ on us.
24125 ^ -
24126 ^ and
24127 ^ jesus
24128 ^ said
24129 ^ to him,
24130 ^ -
24131 ^ if
24132 ^ you are able?
24133 ^ all things
24134 ^ are possible
24135 ^ to the [one] believing.
24137 ^ immediately
24138 ^ having cried out,
24139 ^ the father
24141 ^ of the child
24143 ^ was saying,
24144 ^ i believe;
24145 ^ help
24146 ^ of me the unbelief!
24149 ^ having seen
24150 ^ now
24151 ^ - jesus
24153 ^ that
24154 ^ was running together
24155 ^ a crowd,
24156 ^ he rebuked
24157 ^ the spirit
24159 ^ - unclean,
24161 ^ saying
24162 ^ to it,
24163 ^ -
24164 ^ mute
24165 ^ and deaf spirit,
24168 ^ i
24169 ^ command
24170 ^ you,
24171 ^ come
24172 ^ out of him,
24174 ^ and
24175 ^ no more
24176 ^ may you enter
24177 ^ into him.
24179 ^ and
24180 ^ having cried out,
24181 ^ and
24182 ^ much
24183 ^ having thrown him into convulsions,
24184 ^ it came out;
24185 ^ and
24186 ^ he became
24187 ^ as if dead,
24189 ^ in order for
24190 ^ - many
24192 ^ to say
24193 ^ that
24194 ^ he was dead.
24195 ^ -
24196 ^ and
24197 ^ jesus,
24198 ^ having taken
24199 ^ by the hand him,
24202 ^ raised up
24203 ^ him,
24204 ^ and
24205 ^ he arose.
24206 ^ and
24207 ^ having entered
24208 ^ he
24209 ^ into a house,
24211 ^ the disciples of him
24214 ^ in private
24216 ^ were asking
24217 ^ him,
24218 ^ why
24219 ^ we
24220 ^ not
24221 ^ were able
24222 ^ to cast out
24223 ^ it?
24224 ^ and
24225 ^ he said
24226 ^ to them,
24227 ^ this - kind
24230 ^ by nothing
24232 ^ is able
24233 ^ to go out,
24234 ^ if
24235 ^ not
24236 ^ by prayer.”
24238 ^ from there
24239 ^ having gone forth,
24240 ^ they were passing
24241 ^ through - galilee;
24244 ^ and
24245 ^ not
24246 ^ did he want
24247 ^ that
24248 ^ anyone
24249 ^ should know [it];
24250 ^ he was teaching
24251 ^ for
24252 ^ the disciples of him,
24255 ^ and
24256 ^ he was saying
24257 ^ to them
24258 ^ -,
24259 ^ the son
24261 ^ - of man
24263 ^ is delivered
24264 ^ into [the] hands of men,
24267 ^ and
24268 ^ they will kill
24269 ^ him;
24270 ^ and
24271 ^ having been killed,
24272 ^ on the third day
24275 ^ he will arise.
24276 ^ -
24277 ^ and
24278 ^ they did not understand
24279 ^ the saying,
24281 ^ and
24282 ^ they were afraid
24283 ^ him
24284 ^ to ask.
24285 ^ and
24286 ^ they came
24287 ^ to capernaum.
24289 ^ and
24290 ^ in the house
24293 ^ having been,
24294 ^ he was asking
24295 ^ them,
24296 ^ what
24297 ^ on the way
24300 ^ were you discussing?
24301 ^ -
24302 ^ and
24303 ^ they were silent,
24304 ^ with one another
24306 ^ for
24307 ^ they had been discussing
24308 ^ along the road
24311 ^ which [was]
24312 ^ greatest.
24313 ^ and
24314 ^ having sat down,
24315 ^ he called
24316 ^ the twelve,
24318 ^ and
24319 ^ he says
24320 ^ to them,
24321 ^ if
24322 ^ anyone
24323 ^ desires
24324 ^ first
24325 ^ to be,
24326 ^ he will be
24327 ^ of all last
24329 ^ and
24330 ^ of all servant.
24332 ^ and
24333 ^ having taken
24334 ^ a child,
24335 ^ he set
24336 ^ it
24337 ^ in midst of them;
24340 ^ and
24341 ^ having taken in [his] arms
24342 ^ it,
24343 ^ he said
24344 ^ to them,
24345 ^ whoever
24346 ^ -
24347 ^ one
24348 ^ - of such little children
24351 ^ shall receive
24352 ^ in the name of me,
24356 ^ me
24357 ^ receives;
24358 ^ and
24359 ^ whoever
24360 ^ -
24361 ^ me
24362 ^ shall receive,
24363 ^ not
24364 ^ me
24365 ^ receives,
24366 ^ but
24367 ^ the [one] having sent
24369 ^ me.
24370 ^ answered
24371 ^ him
24372 ^ - john,
24374 ^ teacher,
24375 ^ we saw
24376 ^ someone
24377 ^ in the name of you
24381 ^ casting out
24382 ^ demons,
24383 ^ and
24384 ^ we were forbidding
24385 ^ him,
24386 ^ because
24387 ^ not
24388 ^ he was following
24389 ^ us.
24390 ^ -
24391 ^ and
24392 ^ jesus
24393 ^ said,
24394 ^ not
24395 ^ forbid
24396 ^ him.
24397 ^ no one

24749 ^ that
24750 ^ them
24751 ^ he might touch.
24752 ^ -
24753 ^ but
24754 ^ the disciples
24755 ^ rebuked
24756 ^ them.
24757 ^ having seen
24758 ^ now,
24759 ^ - jesus
24761 ^ was indignant
24762 ^ and
24763 ^ said

24780 ^ - of god.
24782 ^ truly
24783 ^ i say
24784 ^ to you,
24785 ^ whoever
24786 ^ -
24787 ^ not
24788 ^ shall receive
24789 ^ the kingdom

24798 ^ into it.
24800 ^ and
24801 ^ having taken [them] in arms,
24802 ^ them
24803 ^ he was blessing,
24804 ^ having laid
24805 ^ the hands
24807 ^ on them.
24809 ^ and
24810 ^ going forth
24811 ^ of him
24812 ^ on [the] journey,
24814 ^ having run up
24815 ^ one
24816 ^ and
24817 ^ having knelt down to
24818 ^ him,
24819 ^ was asking
24820 ^ him,
24821 ^ teacher good,
24823 ^ what
24824 ^ shall i do,
24825 ^ that
24826 ^ life eternal
24828 ^ i might inherit?
24829 ^ -
24830 ^ and
24831 ^ jesus
24832 ^ said
24833 ^ to him,
24834 ^ why
24835 ^ me
24836 ^ call you
24837 ^ good?
24838 ^ no one [is]

24852 ^ not
24853 ^ shall you steal,
24854 ^ not
24855 ^ shall you bear false witness,
24856 ^ not
24857 ^ shall you defraud,
24858 ^ you shall honor
24859 ^ the father of you
24862 ^ and the mother.’
24865 ^ -
24866 ^ and
24867 ^ he was saying
24868 ^ to him,
24869 ^ teacher,
24870 ^ these all
24872 ^ i have kept
24873 ^ from [the] youth of me.
24876 ^ -
24877 ^ and
24878 ^ jesus,
24879 ^ having looked upon
24880 ^ him,
24881 ^ loved
24882 ^ him
24883 ^ and
24884 ^ said
24885 ^ to him,
24886 ^ one thing
24887 ^ to you
24888 ^ is lacking.
24889 ^ go,
24890 ^ as much as
24891 ^ you have
24892 ^ sell,
24893 ^ and
24894 ^ give
24895 ^ to the poor,
24897 ^ and
24898 ^ you will have
24899 ^ treasure
24900 ^ in heaven;
24902 ^ and

24906 ^ -
24907 ^ and
24908 ^ having been sad
24909 ^ at the word,
24912 ^ he went away
24913 ^ grieving;
24914 ^ he was [one]
24915 ^ for
24916 ^ having
24917 ^ possessions many.
24919 ^ and
24920 ^ having looked around,
24921 ^ - jesus
24923 ^ says
24924 ^ the disciples of him,
24927 ^ how

24940 ^ and
24941 ^ the disciples
24942 ^ were astonished
24943 ^ at the words of him.
24947 ^ -
24948 ^ but
24949 ^ jesus,
24950 ^ again
24951 ^ answering,
24952 ^ says
24953 ^ to them,
24954 ^ children,
24955 ^ how
24956 ^ difficult
24957 ^ it is
24958 ^ into the kingdom
24961 ^ - of god
24963 ^ to enter!
24964 ^ easier
24965 ^ it is
24966 ^ [for] a camel
24967 ^ through the eye
24970 ^ of the needle
24972 ^ to pass,
24973 ^ than [for]

25110 ^ and
25111 ^ having taken to [him]
25112 ^ again
25113 ^ the twelve,
25115 ^ he began
25116 ^ them
25117 ^ to tell

25132 ^ will be betrayed
25133 ^ to the chief priests

25564 ^ to them,
25565 ^ what
25566 ^ are you doing
25567 ^ untying
25568 ^ the colt?
25570 ^ -
25571 ^ and
25572 ^ they spoke
25573 ^ to them
25574 ^ as
25575 ^ had commanded
25576 ^ - jesus,
25578 ^ and
25579 ^ they allowed

25582 ^ they led
25583 ^ the colt
25585 ^ to - jesus,
25588 ^ and
25589 ^ they cast upon
25590 ^ it
25591 ^ the cloaks of them,
25594 ^ and
25595 ^ he sat
25596 ^ on it.
25598 ^ and
25599 ^ many
25600 ^ the cloaks of them
25603 ^ spread
25604 ^ on the road;
25607 ^ others
25608 ^ then,
25609 ^ branches

25630 ^ coming kingdom
25632 ^ of the father of us, david!
25636 ^ hosanna
25637 ^ in the highest!”
25640 ^ and
25641 ^ he entered
25642 ^ into jerusalem,
25644 ^ into the temple,
25647 ^ and
25648 ^ having looked around on
25649 ^ all things,
25650 ^ late
25651 ^ already
25652 ^ being
25653 ^ the hour,
25655 ^ he went out
25656 ^ to bethany
25658 ^ with the twelve.
25661 ^ and
25662 ^ on the next day,
25664 ^ having gone out
25665 ^ they
25666 ^ from bethany,
25668 ^ he was hungry.
25669 ^ and
25670 ^ having seen
25671 ^ a fig tree
25672 ^ from afar,
25674 ^ having
25675 ^ leaves,
25676 ^ he went
25677 ^ if
25678 ^ perhaps
25679 ^ anything
25680 ^ he will find
25681 ^ on it.
25683 ^ and
25684 ^ having come
25685 ^ to it,
25687 ^ nothing
25688 ^ he found,
25689 ^ if
25690 ^ not
25691 ^ leaves;
25692 ^ the
25693 ^ for
25694 ^ season
25695 ^ not
25696 ^ it was
25697 ^ of figs.
25698 ^ and
25699 ^ answering,
25700 ^ he said
25701 ^ to it,
25702 ^ no more
25703 ^ to the age,
25706 ^ of you
25708 ^ no one
25709 ^ fruit
25710 ^ may eat.
25711 ^ and

25713 ^ the disciples of him.
25716 ^ and
25717 ^ they come
25718 ^ to jerusalem.
25720 ^ and
25721 ^ having entered
25722 ^ into the temple,
25725 ^ he began
25726 ^ to cast out
25727 ^ those selling
25729 ^ and
25730 ^ those buying
25732 ^ in the temple;
25735 ^ and
25736 ^ the tables
25738 ^ of the money changers
25740 ^ and the seats
25743 ^ of those selling
25745 ^ the doves
25747 ^ he overturned.
25748 ^ and
25749 ^ not
25750 ^ he would permit
25751 ^ that
25752 ^ anyone
25753 ^ should carry
25754 ^ a vessel
25755 ^ through the temple.
25758 ^ and
25759 ^ he began teaching,
25760 ^ and
25761 ^ was saying
25762 ^ to them,
25763 ^ not
25764 ^ has it been written
25765 ^ -:
25766 ^ the house of me
25769 ^ a house of prayer
25771 ^ will be called
25772 ^ for all the nations’
25775 ^ you
25776 ^ however
25777 ^ have made
25778 ^ it
25779 ^ a den of robbers.’
25781 ^ and
25782 ^ heard [it]
25783 ^ the chief priests
25785 ^ and the scribes,
25788 ^ and
25789 ^ they were seeking
25790 ^ how
25791 ^ him
25792 ^ they might destroy;
25793 ^ they were afraid of
25794 ^ for
25795 ^ him;
25796 ^ all
25797 ^ for
25798 ^ the crowd
25800 ^ was astonished
25801 ^ at the teaching of him.
25805 ^ and
25806 ^ when
25807 ^ evening
25808 ^ came,
25809 ^ they were going forth
25810 ^ out of the city.
25813 ^ and
25814 ^ passing by
25815 ^ in the morning,
25816 ^ they saw
25817 ^ the fig tree
25819 ^ having been dried up
25820 ^ from [the] roots.
25822 ^ and
25823 ^ having remembered,
25824 ^ - peter
25826 ^ says
25827 ^ to him,
25828 ^ rabbi,
25829 ^ look,
25830 ^ the fig tree
25832 ^ that
25833 ^ you cursed
25834 ^ is dried up.
25835 ^ and
25836 ^ answering,
25837 ^ - jesus
25839 ^ says
25840 ^ to them,
25841 ^ have
25842 ^ faith from god.
25844 ^ truly
25845 ^ i say
25846 ^ to you
25847 ^ that
25848 ^ whoever
25849 ^ -
25850 ^ shall say
25851 ^ to the mountain this,
25854 ^ be you taken away
25855 ^ and
25856 ^ be you cast
25857 ^ into the sea,’
25860 ^ and
25861 ^ not
25862 ^ shall doubt
25863 ^ in the heart of him,
25867 ^ but
25868 ^ shall believe
25869 ^ that
25870 ^ what
25871 ^ he says
25872 ^ takes place,
25873 ^ it will be done
25874 ^ for him.
25875 ^ because of this
25877 ^ i say
25878 ^ to you,
25879 ^ all things whatever
25881 ^ praying,
25882 ^ also
25883 ^ you ask,
25884 ^ believe
25885 ^ that
25886 ^ you receive,
25887 ^ and
25888 ^ it will be
25889 ^ to you.
25890 ^ and
25891 ^ when
25892 ^ you may stand
25893 ^ praying,
25894 ^ forgive
25895 ^ if
25896 ^ anything
25897 ^ you have
25898 ^ against anyone,
25900 ^ so that
25901 ^ also
25902 ^ the father of you,
25905 ^ who [is]
25906 ^ in the heavens,
25909 ^ might forgive
25910 ^ you
25911 ^ the trespasses of you.”
25914 ^ and
25915 ^ they come
25916 ^ again
25917 ^ to jerusalem.
25919 ^ and
25920 ^ in the temple
25923 ^ is walking
25924 ^ as he,
25925 ^ come
25926 ^ to him
25928 ^ the chief priests
25930 ^ and the scribes
25933 ^ and the elders.
25936 ^ and
25937 ^ they were saying
25938 ^ to him,
25939 ^ by what authority
25942 ^ these things
25943 ^ are you doing?
25944 ^ or,
25945 ^ who
25946 ^ you
25947 ^ gave
25948 ^ the authority this,
25951 ^ that
25952 ^ these things
25953 ^ you should do?
25954 ^ -
25955 ^ and
25956 ^ jesus
25957 ^ said
25958 ^ to them,
25959 ^ i will ask
25960 ^ you
25961 ^ one question,
25963 ^ and
25964 ^ you answer
25965 ^ me,
25966 ^ and
25967 ^ i will tell
25968 ^ you
25969 ^ by what authority
25972 ^ these things
25973 ^ i do.
25974 ^ the baptism
25976 ^ - of john,
25978 ^ from heaven
25980 ^ was it,
25981 ^ or
25982 ^ from men?
25984 ^ answer
25985 ^ me.
25986 ^ and
25987 ^ they began reasoning
25988 ^ with themselves,
25990 ^ saying,
25991 ^ if
25992 ^ we should say,
25993 ^ from heaven,
25995 ^ he will say,
25996 ^ because of why
25998 ^ then
25999 ^ not
26000 ^ did you believe
26001 ^ him?
26002 ^ but
26003 ^ should we say,
26004 ^ from men’...
26006 ^ they were afraid of
26007 ^ the people;
26009 ^ all
26010 ^ for
26011 ^ were holding
26012 ^ - john
26014 ^ truly
26015 ^ that
26016 ^ a prophet
26017 ^ he was.
26018 ^ and
26019 ^ answering
26020 ^ - to jesus,
26022 ^ they say,
26023 ^ not
26024 ^ do we know.
26025 ^ and
26026 ^ - jesus
26028 ^ says
26029 ^ to them,
26030 ^ neither
26031 ^ i
26032 ^ tell
26033 ^ you
26034 ^ by what authority
26037 ^ these things
26038 ^ i do.
26039 ^ and
26040 ^ he began
26041 ^ to them
26042 ^ in parables
26044 ^ to speak:
26045 ^ a vineyard
26046 ^ a man
26047 ^ planted,
26048 ^ and
26049 ^ he placed around [it]
26050 ^ a fence,
26051 ^ and
26052 ^ dug
26053 ^ a wine vat,
26054 ^ and
26055 ^ built
26056 ^ a tower,
26057 ^ and
26058 ^ rented out
26059 ^ it
26060 ^ to farmers,
26061 ^ and
26062 ^ traveled abroad.
26063 ^ and
26064 ^ he sent
26065 ^ to the farmers
26068 ^ at the due time
26070 ^ a servant,
26071 ^ that
26072 ^ from the farmers
26075 ^ he might receive
26076 ^ from the fruit
26079 ^ of the vineyard.
26081 ^ but
26082 ^ having taken
26083 ^ him,
26084 ^ they beat [him]
26085 ^ and
26086 ^ sent [him] away
26087 ^ empty-handed.
26088 ^ and
26089 ^ again
26090 ^ he sent
26091 ^ to them
26093 ^ another servant,
26095 ^ and him
26096 ^ they struck on the head
26097 ^ and
26098 ^ treated shamefully.
26099 ^ and
26100 ^ another
26101 ^ he sent,
26102 ^ and him
26103 ^ they killed;
26104 ^ also
26105 ^ many others,
26107 ^ some
26108 ^ indeed
26109 ^ beating,
26110 ^ some
26111 ^ then
26112 ^ killing.
26113 ^ yet
26114 ^ one
26115 ^ having
26116 ^ son beloved,
26118 ^ he sent
26119 ^ him
26120 ^ last
26121 ^ to them,
26123 ^ saying
26124 ^ -,
26125 ^ they will have respect for
26126 ^ the son of me.
26129 ^ those
26130 ^ however
26131 ^ - farmers
26133 ^ to themselves
26135 ^ said
26136 ^ -,
26137 ^ this
26138 ^ is
26139 ^ the heir;
26141 ^ come,
26142 ^ let us kill
26143 ^ him,
26144 ^ and
26145 ^ ours
26146 ^ will be
26147 ^ the inheritance.
26149 ^ and
26150 ^ having taken,
26151 ^ they killed
26152 ^ him
26153 ^ and
26154 ^ cast forth
26155 ^ him
26156 ^ outside the vineyard.
26159 ^ what
26160 ^ therefore
26161 ^ will do
26162 ^ the master
26164 ^ of the vineyard?
26166 ^ he will come
26167 ^ and
26168 ^ will destroy
26169 ^ the farmers,
26171 ^ and
26172 ^ will give
26173 ^ the vineyard
26175 ^ to others.
26176 ^ not even

26201 ^ and
26202 ^ they were seeking
26203 ^ him
26204 ^ to lay hold of,
26205 ^ and
26206 ^ they feared
26207 ^ the crowd;

26210 ^ for
26211 ^ that
26212 ^ against them
26214 ^ the parable

26231 ^ that
26232 ^ him
26233 ^ they might catch
26234 ^ in discourse.
26235 ^ and
26236 ^ having come,
26237 ^ they say
26238 ^ to him,
26239 ^ teacher,
26240 ^ we know
26241 ^ that

26251 ^ for
26252 ^ you look

26274 ^ -
26275 ^ and

26277 ^ of them the hypocrisy,
26280 ^ he said
26281 ^ to them,
26282 ^ why
26283 ^ me
26284 ^ do you test?
26285 ^ bring
26286 ^ me
26287 ^ a denarius,

26307 ^ caesar’s.
26308 ^ -
26309 ^ and
26310 ^ jesus

26344 ^ for us
26345 ^ that
26346 ^ if

26386 ^ took
26387 ^ her,
26388 ^ and

26403 ^ last of all
26405 ^ also,
26406 ^ the woman

26418 ^ -
26419 ^ for
26420 ^ the seven
26421 ^ had
26422 ^ her
26423 ^ as wife.
26424 ^ was saying
26425 ^ to them
26426 ^ - jesus,
26428 ^ not
26429 ^ because of this
26431 ^ do you err,
26432 ^ not
26433 ^ knowing
26434 ^ the scriptures,
26436 ^ nor
26437 ^ the power
26439 ^ - of god?
26441 ^ when
26442 ^ for
26443 ^ out from [the] dead

26457 ^ concerning
26458 ^ now
26459 ^ the dead,
26461 ^ that
26462 ^ they rise,
26463 ^ not
26464 ^ have you read
26465 ^ in the book of moses,
26469 ^ on the bush,
26472 ^ how
26473 ^ spoke
26474 ^ to him

26477 ^ saying,
26478 ^ i [am]
26479 ^ the god of abraham,

26494 ^ but
26495 ^ of [the] living.
26496 ^ greatly
26497 ^ you err.
26498 ^ and
26499 ^ having come up
26500 ^ one
26501 ^ of the scribes,
26503 ^ having heard
26504 ^ them
26505 ^ reasoning together,
26506 ^ having seen
26507 ^ that
26508 ^ well
26509 ^ he answered
26510 ^ them,
26511 ^ he questioned
26512 ^ him,
26513 ^ which
26514 ^ is
26515 ^ commandment
26516 ^ [the] first of all?
26518 ^ answered
26519 ^ - jesus,
26521 ^ the
26522 ^ foremost
26523 ^ is,

26535 ^ [the] lord
26536 ^ - god of you
26539 ^ with all
26541 ^ the heart of you,
26544 ^ and with all
26547 ^ the soul of you,
26550 ^ and with all
26553 ^ the mind of you,
26556 ^ and with all
26559 ^ the strength of you.’
26562 ^ [the] second
26563 ^ this:
26564 ^ you shall love
26565 ^ the neighbor of you
26568 ^ as yourself.’
26570 ^ greater than these
26572 ^ another commandment
26574 ^ not
26575 ^ there is.
26576 ^ and
26577 ^ said
26578 ^ to him
26579 ^ the scribe,
26581 ^ right,
26582 ^ teacher,
26583 ^ according to truth
26585 ^ you have spoken
26586 ^ that
26587 ^ one
26588 ^ he is,
26589 ^ and
26590 ^ not
26591 ^ there is
26592 ^ another
26593 ^ besides him,
26595 ^ and
26596 ^ - to love
26598 ^ him
26599 ^ with all

26611 ^ the strength,
26613 ^ and
26614 ^ - to love
26616 ^ the neighbor
26618 ^ as oneself
26620 ^ more important
26621 ^ is
26622 ^ than all the burnt offerings
26625 ^ and sacrifices.
26627 ^ and
26628 ^ - jesus,
26630 ^ having seen
26631 ^ him
26632 ^ that
26633 ^ wisely
26634 ^ he answered,
26635 ^ said
26636 ^ to him,
26637 ^ not
26638 ^ far
26639 ^ are you
26640 ^ from the kingdom
26643 ^ - of god.
26645 ^ and
26646 ^ no one
26647 ^ no longer
26648 ^ dared
26649 ^ him
26650 ^ to question.
26651 ^ and
26652 ^ answering,
26653 ^ - jesus
26655 ^ was saying,
26656 ^ teaching
26657 ^ in the temple,
26660 ^ how
26661 ^ say
26662 ^ the scribes
26664 ^ that
26665 ^ the christ,
26667 ^ [the] son of david
26669 ^ is?
26670 ^ himself david
26672 ^ said
26673 ^ by the spirit
26676 ^ - holy:

26679 ^ [the] lord
26680 ^ to the lord of me,
26683 ^ sit
26684 ^ at [the] right hand of me,
26687 ^ until
26688 ^ -
26689 ^ i place
26690 ^ of the enemies of you
26693 ^ [as] a footstool of the feet of you.”’
26697 ^ himself david
26699 ^ calls
26700 ^ him
26701 ^ lord,
26702 ^ then
26703 ^ how
26704 ^ of him
26705 ^ is he
26706 ^ son?
26707 ^ and
26708 ^ the great crowd
26711 ^ was listening
26712 ^ to him
26713 ^ gladly.
26714 ^ and
26715 ^ in the teaching of him,
26719 ^ he was saying,
26720 ^ beware
26721 ^ of the scribes,
26724 ^ - desiring
26726 ^ in robes
26728 ^ to walk about,
26729 ^ and greetings
26731 ^ in the marketplaces,
26734 ^ and first seats
26736 ^ in the synagogues,
26739 ^ and first places
26741 ^ at the feasts;
26744 ^ those devouring
26746 ^ the houses
26748 ^ of the widows,
26750 ^ and
26751 ^ as a pretext,
26752 ^ at great length
26753 ^ praying.
26754 ^ these
26755 ^ will receive
26756 ^ greater judgment.
26758 ^ and
26759 ^ having sat down
26760 ^ opposite the treasury,
26763 ^ he was watching
26764 ^ how
26765 ^ the crowd
26767 ^ cast
26768 ^ money
26769 ^ into the treasury;
26772 ^ and
26773 ^ many rich
26775 ^ were casting [in]
26776 ^ much.
26777 ^ and
26778 ^ having come,
26779 ^ one widow poor
26782 ^ cast [in]
26783 ^ lepta two,
26785 ^ which
26786 ^ is
26787 ^ a kodrantes.
26788 ^ and
26789 ^ having called to [him]
26790 ^ the disciples of him,
26793 ^ he says
26794 ^ to them,
26795 ^ truly
26796 ^ i say
26797 ^ to you
26798 ^ that
26799 ^ the widow
26801 ^ this
26802 ^ - poor,
26804 ^ more
26805 ^ than all
26806 ^ has cast [in]
26807 ^ of those casting
26809 ^ into the treasury.
26812 ^ all
26813 ^ for
26814 ^ out of that which was abounding
26817 ^ to them
26818 ^ cast [in];
26819 ^ she
26820 ^ however,
26821 ^ out of the poverty of her,
26825 ^ all as much as
26827 ^ she had
26828 ^ cast [in],
26829 ^ all the livelihood of her.
26833 ^ and
26834 ^ going forth
26835 ^ of him
26836 ^ out of the temple,
26839 ^ says
26840 ^ to him
26841 ^ one
26842 ^ of the disciples of him,

26875 ^ of him
26876 ^ upon the mount

27124 ^ in those - days!
27128 ^ pray
27129 ^ then
27130 ^ that it
27131 ^ not
27132 ^ might be
27133 ^ in winter;
27134 ^ will be [in]
27135 ^ for
27136 ^ the days those
27139 ^ tribulation,
27140 ^ such as
27141 ^ never
27142 ^ has been
27143 ^ the like,
27144 ^ from [the] beginning
27146 ^ of creation,
27147 ^ which
27148 ^ created
27149 ^ - god,
27151 ^ until - now —
27154 ^ and
27155 ^ never not
27157 ^ shall be.
27158 ^ and
27159 ^ if
27160 ^ not
27161 ^ had shortened
27162 ^ [the] lord
27163 ^ the days,
27165 ^ no
27166 ^ -
27167 ^ there would have been saved
27168 ^ any flesh;
27170 ^ but
27171 ^ on account of the elect
27174 ^ whom
27175 ^ he chose,
27176 ^ he has shortened
27177 ^ the days.
27179 ^ and
27180 ^ then
27181 ^ if
27182 ^ anyone
27183 ^ to you
27184 ^ says,
27185 ^ behold,
27186 ^ here [is]
27187 ^ the christ!
27189 ^ behold,
27190 ^ there!
27191 ^ not
27192 ^ you shall believe [it].
27193 ^ there will arise
27194 ^ for
27195 ^ false christs
27196 ^ and false prophets,
27198 ^ and
27199 ^ will give
27200 ^ signs
27201 ^ and wonders,
27203 ^ so as - to deceive
27206 ^ if
27207 ^ possible,
27208 ^ the elect.
27210 ^ you
27211 ^ however
27212 ^ take heed;
27213 ^ i have foretold
27214 ^ to you
27215 ^ all things.
27216 ^ but
27217 ^ in those - days,
27221 ^ after the tribulation those,
27225 ^ the sun
27227 ^ will be darkened,
27228 ^ and
27229 ^ the moon
27231 ^ not
27232 ^ will give
27233 ^ the light of it;
27236 ^ and
27237 ^ the stars
27239 ^ will be
27240 ^ out of the heaven
27243 ^ falling,
27244 ^ and
27245 ^ the powers
27247 ^ that [are]
27248 ^ in the heavens
27251 ^ will be shaken.’
27252 ^ and
27253 ^ then
27254 ^ will they see
27255 ^ the son
27257 ^ - of man
27259 ^ coming
27260 ^ in [the] clouds,
27262 ^ with power great
27265 ^ and glory.
27267 ^ and
27268 ^ then
27269 ^ he will send
27270 ^ the angels,
27272 ^ and
27273 ^ will gather together
27274 ^ the elect of him,
27277 ^ from the four winds,
27281 ^ from [the] end of earth
27284 ^ to [the] end of heaven.
27287 ^ of
27288 ^ now
27289 ^ the fig tree,
27291 ^ learn
27292 ^ the parable:
27294 ^ when
27295 ^ already
27296 ^ the branch of it
27299 ^ tender
27300 ^ has become,
27301 ^ and
27302 ^ it puts forth
27303 ^ the leaves,
27305 ^ you know
27306 ^ that
27307 ^ near
27308 ^ the summer
27310 ^ is.
27311 ^ so
27312 ^ also
27313 ^ you,
27314 ^ when
27315 ^ you see
27316 ^ these things
27317 ^ coming to pass,
27318 ^ know
27319 ^ that
27320 ^ near
27321 ^ he is,
27322 ^ at [the] doors.
27324 ^ truly
27325 ^ i say
27326 ^ to you
27327 ^ that
27328 ^ no not
27330 ^ will have passed away
27331 ^ the generation this
27334 ^ until that
27336 ^ these things all
27338 ^ shall have taken place.
27339 ^ the heaven
27341 ^ and the earth
27344 ^ will pass away,
27345 ^ -
27346 ^ but
27347 ^ the words of me
27349 ^ in no way not
27351 ^ will pass away.
27352 ^ concerning
27353 ^ now
27354 ^ the day that,
27357 ^ or the hour,
27360 ^ no one
27361 ^ knows;
27362 ^ not even
27363 ^ the angels
27365 ^ in heaven,
27367 ^ nor
27368 ^ the son,
27370 ^ if
27371 ^ not
27372 ^ the father.
27374 ^ take heed;
27375 ^ watch;
27376 ^ not
27377 ^ you know
27378 ^ for
27379 ^ when
27380 ^ the time
27382 ^ is.
27383 ^ [it is] like a man
27385 ^ going on a journey,
27386 ^ having left
27387 ^ the house of him,
27390 ^ and
27391 ^ having given
27392 ^ the servants of him
27395 ^ - authority,
27397 ^ to each one
27398 ^ the work of him.
27401 ^ and
27402 ^ the doorkeeper
27404 ^ he commanded
27405 ^ that
27406 ^ he should keep watch.
27407 ^ watch
27408 ^ therefore —
27409 ^ not
27410 ^ you know
27411 ^ for
27412 ^ when
27413 ^ the master
27415 ^ of the house
27417 ^ comes,
27418 ^ or at evening,
27420 ^ or at midnight,
27422 ^ or when the rooster crows,
27424 ^ or morning —
27426 ^ lest
27427 ^ having come
27428 ^ suddenly,
27429 ^ he should find
27430 ^ you
27431 ^ sleeping.
27432 ^ what
27433 ^ now
27434 ^ to you
27435 ^ i say,
27436 ^ to all
27437 ^ i say:
27438 ^ watch!
27439 ^ it would be
27440 ^ now
27441 ^ the passover
27443 ^ and the [feast of] unleavened bread,
27446 ^ after two days.
27449 ^ and
27450 ^ were seeking
27451 ^ the chief priests
27453 ^ and the scribes
27456 ^ how,
27457 ^ him
27458 ^ by stealth
27460 ^ having taken,
27461 ^ they might kill [him].
27462 ^ they were saying
27463 ^ for,
27464 ^ not
27465 ^ during the feast,
27468 ^ lest ever
27469 ^ there will be
27470 ^ an uproar
27471 ^ of the people.
27473 ^ and
27474 ^ being
27475 ^ of him
27476 ^ in bethany
27478 ^ in the house
27481 ^ of simon
27482 ^ the leper,
27484 ^ having reclined
27485 ^ of him,
27486 ^ came
27487 ^ a woman
27488 ^ having
27489 ^ an alabaster flask
27490 ^ of fragrant oil
27491 ^ of nard
27492 ^ pure of great price;
27494 ^ having broken
27495 ^ the alabaster flask,
27497 ^ she poured [it] on
27498 ^ his - head.
27501 ^ were
27502 ^ now
27503 ^ some
27504 ^ indignant
27505 ^ within themselves:
27507 ^ to what
27509 ^ the waste this
27512 ^ of the fragrant oil
27514 ^ has been made?
27515 ^ could
27516 ^ for
27517 ^ this - fragrant oil
27520 ^ to have been sold
27521 ^ for above denarii three hundred,
27524 ^ and
27525 ^ to have been given
27526 ^ to the poor.
27528 ^ and
27529 ^ they were grumbling
27530 ^ at her.
27531 ^ -
27532 ^ and
27533 ^ jesus
27534 ^ said,
27535 ^ leave alone
27536 ^ her;
27537 ^ why
27538 ^ to her
27539 ^ trouble
27540 ^ do you cause?
27541 ^ a good work
27543 ^ she did
27544 ^ toward me.
27546 ^ always
27547 ^ for
27548 ^ the poor
27550 ^ you have
27551 ^ with you,
27553 ^ and
27554 ^ whenever
27555 ^ you desire
27556 ^ you are able
27557 ^ them
27558 ^ good
27559 ^ to do;
27560 ^ me
27561 ^ however
27562 ^ not
27563 ^ always
27564 ^ do you have.
27565 ^ what
27566 ^ she could,
27567 ^ she did.
27568 ^ she came beforehand
27569 ^ to anoint
27570 ^ the body of me
27573 ^ for the burial.
27576 ^ truly
27577 ^ now
27578 ^ i say
27579 ^ to you,
27580 ^ wherever
27581 ^ if
27582 ^ shall be proclaimed
27583 ^ the gospel
27585 ^ in whole the world,
27589 ^ also
27590 ^ what
27591 ^ has done
27592 ^ this [woman]
27593 ^ will be spoken of
27594 ^ for a memorial of her.
27597 ^ and
27598 ^ judas
27599 ^ iscariot,
27600 ^ - one
27602 ^ of the twelve,
27604 ^ went away
27605 ^ to the chief priests,
27608 ^ that
27609 ^ him
27610 ^ he might betray
27611 ^ to them.
27612 ^ -
27613 ^ and
27614 ^ having heard,
27615 ^ they rejoiced,
27616 ^ and
27617 ^ promised
27618 ^ him
27619 ^ money
27620 ^ to give.
27621 ^ and
27622 ^ he was seeking
27623 ^ how
27624 ^ him
27625 ^ conveniently
27626 ^ he might deliver up.
27627 ^ and
27628 ^ on the first day
27631 ^ - of unleavened [bread],
27633 ^ when
27634 ^ the passover lamb
27636 ^ they were to sacrifice,
27637 ^ say
27638 ^ to him
27639 ^ the disciples of him,
27642 ^ where
27643 ^ do you desire [that],
27644 ^ having gone,
27645 ^ we should prepare
27646 ^ that
27647 ^ you may eat
27648 ^ the passover?
27650 ^ and
27651 ^ he sends forth
27652 ^ two
27653 ^ of the disciples of him
27656 ^ and
27657 ^ says
27658 ^ to them,
27659 ^ go
27660 ^ into the city,
27663 ^ and
27664 ^ will meet
27665 ^ you
27666 ^ a man,
27667 ^ a pitcher of water
27669 ^ carrying.
27670 ^ follow
27671 ^ him.
27672 ^ and
27673 ^ wherever
27674 ^ if
27675 ^ he might enter,
27676 ^ say
27677 ^ to the master of the house
27679 ^ that
27680 ^ the teacher
27682 ^ says,
27683 ^ where
27684 ^ is
27685 ^ the guest room of me,
27688 ^ where
27689 ^ the passover
27691 ^ with the disciples of me
27695 ^ i may eat?
27696 ^ and
27697 ^ he
27698 ^ you
27699 ^ will show
27700 ^ an upper room
27701 ^ large,
27702 ^ having been furnished [and] ready.
27704 ^ and
27705 ^ there
27706 ^ prepare
27707 ^ for us.
27708 ^ and
27709 ^ went away
27710 ^ - his disciples,
27712 ^ and
27713 ^ came
27714 ^ into the city,
27717 ^ and
27718 ^ found
27719 ^ as
27720 ^ he had said
27721 ^ to them,
27722 ^ and
27723 ^ they prepared
27724 ^ the passover.
27726 ^ and
27727 ^ evening
27728 ^ having arrived,
27729 ^ he comes
27730 ^ with the twelve.
27733 ^ and
27734 ^ as were reclining
27735 ^ they,
27736 ^ and
27737 ^ were eating,
27738 ^ - jesus
27740 ^ said,
27741 ^ truly
27742 ^ i say
27743 ^ to you
27744 ^ that
27745 ^ one
27746 ^ of you
27748 ^ will betray
27749 ^ me,
27750 ^ who is eating
27752 ^ with me.
27754 ^ they began
27755 ^ to be grieved
27756 ^ and
27757 ^ to say
27758 ^ to him
27759 ^ one
27760 ^ by one,
27762 ^ surely not
27763 ^ i?
27764 ^ -
27765 ^ and
27766 ^ he said
27767 ^ to them,
27768 ^ [it is] one of
27769 ^ the twelve,
27771 ^ who is dipping
27773 ^ with me
27775 ^ in the bowl.
27778 ^ for
27779 ^ -
27780 ^ indeed
27781 ^ the son
27782 ^ - of man
27784 ^ goes
27785 ^ as
27786 ^ it has been written
27787 ^ concerning him;
27789 ^ woe
27790 ^ however
27791 ^ to the man that
27794 ^ by whom
27796 ^ the son
27798 ^ - of man
27800 ^ is betrayed;
27801 ^ better
27802 ^ for him [it were]
27803 ^ if
27804 ^ not
27805 ^ had been born
27806 ^ the man that.
27809 ^ and
27810 ^ they were eating
27811 ^ of them,
27812 ^ having taken
27813 ^ bread,
27814 ^ having spoken a blessing,
27815 ^ he broke,
27816 ^ and
27817 ^ gave
27818 ^ to them,
27819 ^ and
27820 ^ said,
27821 ^ take;
27822 ^ this
27823 ^ is
27824 ^ the body of me.
27827 ^ and
27828 ^ having taken
27829 ^ the cup,
27830 ^ having given thanks,
27831 ^ he gave [it]
27832 ^ to them,
27833 ^ and
27834 ^ they drank
27835 ^ of it
27837 ^ all.
27838 ^ and
27839 ^ he said
27840 ^ to them,
27841 ^ this
27842 ^ is
27843 ^ the blood
27845 ^ of me
27846 ^ of the covenant,
27848 ^ which is being poured out
27850 ^ for many.
27852 ^ truly
27853 ^ i say
27854 ^ to you
27855 ^ that
27856 ^ no more
27857 ^ never not
27859 ^ will i drink
27860 ^ of the fruit
27863 ^ of the vine,
27865 ^ until the day that
27869 ^ when
27870 ^ it
27871 ^ i drink
27872 ^ anew
27873 ^ in the kingdom
27876 ^ - of god.
27878 ^ and
27879 ^ having sung a hymn,
27880 ^ they went out
27881 ^ to the mount
27884 ^ - of olives.
27886 ^ and
27887 ^ says
27888 ^ to them
27889 ^ - jesus
27891 ^ -,
27892 ^ all
27893 ^ you will fall away,
27894 ^ for
27895 ^ it has been written:
27896 ^ i will strike
27897 ^ the shepherd,
27899 ^ and
27900 ^ the sheep
27902 ^ will be scattered.’
27903 ^ but
27904 ^ after - having arisen,
27907 ^ i
27908 ^ will go before
27909 ^ you
27910 ^ into - galilee.
27913 ^ -
27914 ^ and
27915 ^ peter
27916 ^ was saying
27917 ^ to him,
27918 ^ if
27919 ^ even
27920 ^ all
27921 ^ will fall away,
27922 ^ yet
27923 ^ not
27924 ^ i.
27925 ^ and
27926 ^ says
27927 ^ to him
27928 ^ - jesus,
27930 ^ truly
27931 ^ i say
27932 ^ to you
27933 ^ that
27934 ^ yourself
27935 ^ now
27936 ^ this - night,
27939 ^ before
27940 ^ that
27941 ^ twice
27942 ^ [the] rooster
27943 ^ crows,
27944 ^ three times
27945 ^ me
27946 ^ you will deny.
27947 ^ -
27948 ^ and
27949 ^ emphatically
27950 ^ he kept saying,
27951 ^ if
27952 ^ it is needful
27953 ^ of me
27954 ^ to die with
27955 ^ you,
27956 ^ no not
27958 ^ you
27959 ^ will i deny.
27960 ^ likewise
27961 ^ now
27962 ^ also
27963 ^ all
27964 ^ of them were saying.
27965 ^ and
27966 ^ they come
27967 ^ to a place,
27969 ^ of which the name [is]
27972 ^ gethsemane;
27973 ^ and
27974 ^ he says
27975 ^ to the disciples of him,
27978 ^ sit
27979 ^ here,
27980 ^ while
27981 ^ i shall pray.
27982 ^ and
27983 ^ he takes
27984 ^ - peter
27986 ^ and - james
27989 ^ and - john
27992 ^ with him;
27994 ^ and
27995 ^ he began
27996 ^ to be greatly awe-struck
27997 ^ and
27998 ^ deeply distressed.
27999 ^ and
28000 ^ he says
28001 ^ to them,
28002 ^ very sorrowful
28003 ^ is
28004 ^ the soul of me,
28007 ^ even to death;
28009 ^ remain
28010 ^ here
28011 ^ and
28012 ^ watch.
28013 ^ and
28014 ^ having gone forward
28015 ^ a little,
28016 ^ he fell
28017 ^ upon the ground
28020 ^ and
28021 ^ was praying
28022 ^ that,
28023 ^ if
28024 ^ possible
28025 ^ it is,
28026 ^ might pass
28027 ^ from him
28029 ^ the hour.
28031 ^ and
28032 ^ he was saying,
28033 ^ abba,
28034 ^ - father,
28036 ^ all things [are]
28037 ^ possible

28043 ^ from me;
28045 ^ but
28046 ^ not
28047 ^ what
28048 ^ i
28049 ^ will,
28050 ^ but
28051 ^ what
28052 ^ you.
28053 ^ and
28054 ^ he comes
28055 ^ and
28056 ^ finds
28057 ^ them
28058 ^ sleeping.
28059 ^ and
28060 ^ he says
28061 ^ - to peter,
28063 ^ simon,
28064 ^ are you asleep?
28065 ^ not
28066 ^ were you able
28067 ^ one hour

28070 ^ watch
28071 ^ and

28073 ^ so that
28074 ^ not
28075 ^ you may enter
28076 ^ into temptation.
28078 ^ the
28079 ^ indeed
28080 ^ spirit
28081 ^ [is] willing,
28082 ^ -
28083 ^ but
28084 ^ the flesh
28085 ^ weak.
28086 ^ and
28087 ^ again
28088 ^ having gone away,
28089 ^ he prayed,
28090 ^ the same thing
28093 ^ having said.
28094 ^ and
28095 ^ again
28096 ^ having returned,
28097 ^ he found
28098 ^ them
28099 ^ sleeping.
28100 ^ were
28101 ^ for
28102 ^ of them the eyes
28105 ^ heavy;

28108 ^ they knew
28109 ^ what
28110 ^ they should answer
28111 ^ him.
28112 ^ and
28113 ^ he comes
28114 ^ the third time,
28116 ^ and
28117 ^ says
28118 ^ to them,
28119 ^ are you sleeping
28120 ^ - still
28122 ^ and
28123 ^ taking your rest.
28124 ^ it is enough;
28125 ^ has come
28126 ^ the hour;
28128 ^ behold,
28129 ^ is delivered up
28130 ^ the son
28132 ^ - of man
28134 ^ into the hands

28141 ^ behold,
28142 ^ the [one] betraying
28144 ^ me
28145 ^ has drawn near!

28147 ^ immediately
28148 ^ while yet
28149 ^ of him
28150 ^ speaking,
28151 ^ comes up
28152 ^ judas,
28153 ^ one
28154 ^ of the twelve,
28156 ^ and
28157 ^ with him a crowd
28160 ^ with swords
28162 ^ and clubs,
28164 ^ from the chief priests
28167 ^ and the scribes

28173 ^ had given
28174 ^ then
28175 ^ the [one] delivering up
28177 ^ him
28178 ^ a sign
28179 ^ to them,
28180 ^ saying:
28181 ^ whomever

28192 ^ having arrived,
28193 ^ immediately
28194 ^ having come up
28195 ^ to him,
28196 ^ he says,
28197 ^ rabbi!
28198 ^ and
28199 ^ he kissed
28200 ^ him.
28201 ^ -
28202 ^ and
28203 ^ they laid
28204 ^ the hands
28206 ^ on him
28207 ^ and
28208 ^ seized
28209 ^ him.
28210 ^ one
28211 ^ then,
28212 ^ a certain
28213 ^ of those standing by,
28215 ^ having drawn
28216 ^ the sword,
28218 ^ struck
28219 ^ the servant
28221 ^ of the high priest
28223 ^ and
28224 ^ cut off
28225 ^ of him the ear.
28228 ^ and
28229 ^ answering,
28230 ^ - jesus
28232 ^ said
28233 ^ to them,
28234 ^ as against a robber
28237 ^ are you come out
28238 ^ with swords
28240 ^ and clubs
28242 ^ to capture
28243 ^ me?
28244 ^ every day
28246 ^ i was
28247 ^ with you
28249 ^ in the temple
28252 ^ teaching,
28253 ^ and
28254 ^ not
28255 ^ you did seize
28256 ^ me.
28257 ^ but [it is]
28258 ^ that
28259 ^ may be fulfilled
28260 ^ the scriptures.
28262 ^ and
28263 ^ having left
28264 ^ him,
28265 ^ fled
28266 ^ all.
28267 ^ and
28268 ^ [a] young man certain
28270 ^ was following
28271 ^ him,
28272 ^ having cast
28273 ^ a linen cloth
28274 ^ about [his] naked [body];
28276 ^ and
28277 ^ they seize
28278 ^ him,
28279 ^ -
28280 ^ and
28281 ^ having left behind
28282 ^ the linen cloth,
28284 ^ naked
28285 ^ he fled.
28286 ^ and
28287 ^ they led away
28288 ^ - jesus
28290 ^ to the high priest.
28293 ^ and
28294 ^ come together
28295 ^ all the chief priests,
28298 ^ and the elders,
28301 ^ and the scribes.
28304 ^ and
28305 ^ - peter
28307 ^ from afar off
28309 ^ followed
28310 ^ him,
28311 ^ as far as within
28313 ^ to the court
28316 ^ of the high priest;
28318 ^ and
28319 ^ he was
28320 ^ sitting
28321 ^ with the officers
28324 ^ and
28325 ^ warming himself
28326 ^ at the fire.
28329 ^ -
28330 ^ and
28331 ^ the chief priests
28332 ^ and all the council
28336 ^ were seeking
28337 ^ against - jesus
28340 ^ testimony,
28341 ^ to - put to death
28344 ^ him,
28345 ^ but
28346 ^ not
28347 ^ they were finding [any].
28348 ^ many
28349 ^ for
28350 ^ were bearing false testimony
28351 ^ against him,
28353 ^ but
28354 ^ alike
28355 ^ their testimonies
28357 ^ not
28358 ^ were.
28359 ^ and
28360 ^ some
28361 ^ having risen up,
28362 ^ were bearing false testimony
28363 ^ against him,
28365 ^ saying,
28366 ^ -
28367 ^ we
28368 ^ heard
28369 ^ him
28370 ^ saying
28371 ^ -,
28372 ^ i
28373 ^ will destroy
28374 ^ the temple
28376 ^ this,
28377 ^ the [one] made with hands,
28379 ^ and
28380 ^ in three days
28383 ^ another, not made with hands,
28385 ^ i will build.
28386 ^ and
28387 ^ neither
28388 ^ thus
28389 ^ alike
28390 ^ was
28391 ^ the testimony of them.
28394 ^ and
28395 ^ having stood up
28396 ^ the high priest
28398 ^ in the midst,
28400 ^ he questioned
28401 ^ - jesus,
28403 ^ saying,
28404 ^ not
28405 ^ answer you
28406 ^ nothing?
28407 ^ what [is it]
28408 ^ these
28409 ^ you
28410 ^ testify against?
28411 ^ -
28412 ^ but
28413 ^ he was silent,
28414 ^ and
28415 ^ not
28416 ^ did he answer
28417 ^ nothing.
28418 ^ again
28419 ^ the high priest
28421 ^ was questioning
28422 ^ him,
28423 ^ and
28424 ^ says
28425 ^ to him,
28426 ^ you
28427 ^ are
28428 ^ the christ,
28430 ^ the son
28432 ^ of the blessed [one]?
28434 ^ -
28435 ^ and
28436 ^ jesus
28437 ^ said,
28438 ^ i
28439 ^ am.
28440 ^ and
28441 ^ you will see
28442 ^ the son
28444 ^ - of man
28446 ^ at [the] right hand
28448 ^ sitting
28449 ^ of power,
28451 ^ and
28452 ^ coming
28453 ^ with the clouds
28456 ^ of heaven.
28458 ^ -
28459 ^ and
28460 ^ the high priest,
28461 ^ having torn
28462 ^ the garments of him,
28465 ^ says,
28466 ^ what
28467 ^ any more
28468 ^ need
28469 ^ have we
28470 ^ of witnesses?
28471 ^ you heard
28472 ^ the blasphemy.
28474 ^ what
28475 ^ to you
28476 ^ does it appear?
28477 ^ -
28478 ^ and
28479 ^ all
28480 ^ condemned
28481 ^ him
28482 ^ deserving
28483 ^ to be
28484 ^ of death.
28485 ^ and
28486 ^ began
28487 ^ some
28488 ^ to spit upon
28489 ^ him,
28490 ^ and
28491 ^ to cover up
28492 ^ of him the face,
28495 ^ and
28496 ^ to strike
28497 ^ him,
28498 ^ and
28499 ^ to say
28500 ^ to him,
28501 ^ prophesy!
28502 ^ and
28503 ^ the officers
28505 ^ with the palms
28506 ^ him
28507 ^ received.
28508 ^ and
28509 ^ being
28510 ^ - peter
28512 ^ below
28513 ^ in the courtyard,
28516 ^ comes
28517 ^ one
28518 ^ of the servant girls
28520 ^ of the high priest,
28522 ^ and
28523 ^ having seen
28524 ^ - peter
28526 ^ warming himself,
28527 ^ having looked at
28528 ^ him,
28529 ^ she says,
28530 ^ also
28531 ^ you
28532 ^ with the nazarene
28535 ^ were,
28536 ^ - jesus.
28538 ^ -
28539 ^ but
28540 ^ he denied [it],
28541 ^ saying,
28542 ^ neither
28543 ^ i know,
28544 ^ nor even
28545 ^ understand
28546 ^ you
28547 ^ what
28548 ^ say.
28549 ^ and
28550 ^ he went forth
28551 ^ out
28552 ^ into the porch;
28555 ^ and
28556 ^ the rooster
28557 ^ crowed.
28558 ^ and
28559 ^ the servant girl,
28561 ^ having seen
28562 ^ him,
28563 ^ began
28564 ^ again
28565 ^ to say
28566 ^ to those standing by
28568 ^ -,
28569 ^ this
28570 ^ [one] of them
28572 ^ is.
28573 ^ -
28574 ^ but
28575 ^ again
28576 ^ he denied.
28577 ^ and
28578 ^ after a little,
28580 ^ again
28581 ^ those standing by
28583 ^ were saying
28584 ^ - to peter,
28586 ^ truly
28587 ^ of them
28589 ^ you are,
28590 ^ also
28591 ^ for
28592 ^ a galilean
28593 ^ you are.”
28594 ^ -
28595 ^ but
28596 ^ he began
28597 ^ to curse
28598 ^ and
28599 ^ to swear
28600 ^ -,
28601 ^ not
28602 ^ i know
28603 ^ the man this,
28606 ^ whom
28607 ^ you speak of!
28608 ^ and
28609 ^ immediately
28610 ^ for the second time
28612 ^ a rooster
28613 ^ crowed.
28614 ^ and
28615 ^ remembered
28616 ^ - peter
28618 ^ the word
28620 ^ that
28621 ^ had said
28622 ^ to him
28623 ^ - jesus
28625 ^ -,
28626 ^ before
28627 ^ [the] rooster
28628 ^ crows,
28629 ^ twice
28630 ^ three times
28631 ^ me
28632 ^ you will deny.
28633 ^ and
28634 ^ having broken down,
28635 ^ he began to weep.
28636 ^ and
28637 ^ early
28638 ^ in the morning,
28639 ^ a counsel
28640 ^ having formed
28641 ^ the chief priests,
28643 ^ with the elders,
28646 ^ and scribes,
28648 ^ and all the council,
28652 ^ having bound
28653 ^ - jesus,
28655 ^ they led [him] away
28656 ^ and
28657 ^ delivered [him]
28658 ^ to pilate.
28659 ^ and
28660 ^ questioned
28661 ^ him
28662 ^ - pilate,
28664 ^ you
28665 ^ are
28666 ^ the king
28668 ^ of the jews?
28670 ^ -
28671 ^ and
28672 ^ answering
28673 ^ to him,
28674 ^ he says,
28675 ^ you
28676 ^ have said.
28677 ^ and
28678 ^ were accusing
28679 ^ him
28680 ^ the chief priests
28682 ^ of many things.
28683 ^ -
28684 ^ and
28685 ^ pilate
28686 ^ again
28687 ^ began to question
28688 ^ him,
28689 ^ saying,
28690 ^ not
28691 ^ answer you
28692 ^ nothing?
28693 ^ see
28694 ^ how many things
28695 ^ you
28696 ^ they testify against!
28697 ^ -
28698 ^ but
28699 ^ jesus
28700 ^ no longer
28701 ^ nothing
28702 ^ answered,
28703 ^ so as
28704 ^ to amaze
28705 ^ - pilate.
28707 ^ at
28708 ^ then
28709 ^ [the] feast,
28710 ^ he used to release
28711 ^ to them
28712 ^ one prisoner,
28714 ^ whom
28715 ^ they requested.
28716 ^ there was
28717 ^ then
28718 ^ the [one] called
28720 ^ barabbas,
28721 ^ with the rebels
28724 ^ having been bound,
28725 ^ who
28726 ^ in the insurrection
28729 ^ murder
28730 ^ had committed.
28731 ^ and
28732 ^ having cried out,
28733 ^ the crowd
28735 ^ began
28736 ^ to beg [him to do]
28737 ^ as usually
28738 ^ he did
28739 ^ for them.
28740 ^ -
28741 ^ but
28742 ^ pilate
28743 ^ answered
28744 ^ them,
28745 ^ saying,
28746 ^ wish you [that]
28747 ^ i should release
28748 ^ to you
28749 ^ the king
28751 ^ of the jews?
28753 ^ he was aware
28754 ^ for
28755 ^ that
28756 ^ because of envy
28758 ^ had delivered up
28759 ^ him
28760 ^ the chief priests.
28762 ^ -
28763 ^ but
28764 ^ the chief priests
28765 ^ stirred up
28766 ^ the crowd
28768 ^ so that
28769 ^ instead
28770 ^ - barabbas
28772 ^ he might release
28773 ^ to them.
28774 ^ -
28775 ^ and
28776 ^ pilate
28777 ^ again
28778 ^ answering,
28779 ^ was saying
28780 ^ to them,
28781 ^ what
28782 ^ then
28783 ^ do you wish [that]
28784 ^ i should do
28785 ^ to him
28786 ^ you call
28787 ^ the king
28789 ^ of the jews?
28791 ^ -
28792 ^ and
28793 ^ again
28794 ^ they cried out,
28795 ^ crucify
28796 ^ him!
28797 ^ -
28798 ^ and
28799 ^ pilate
28800 ^ was saying
28801 ^ to them,
28802 ^ what
28803 ^ indeed
28804 ^ did he commit
28805 ^ evil?
28806 ^ -
28807 ^ but
28808 ^ much more
28809 ^ they shouted,
28810 ^ crucify
28811 ^ him!
28812 ^ -
28813 ^ and
28814 ^ pilate,
28815 ^ desiring
28816 ^ to the crowd
28818 ^ that which [was] satisfactory
28820 ^ to do,
28821 ^ released
28822 ^ to them
28823 ^ - barabbas,
28825 ^ and
28826 ^ he delivered
28827 ^ - jesus,
28829 ^ having flogged [him],
28830 ^ that
28831 ^ he might be crucified.
28832 ^ -
28833 ^ and
28834 ^ the soldiers
28835 ^ led away
28836 ^ him
28837 ^ into the palace,
28840 ^ that
28841 ^ is
28842 ^ [the] praetorium,
28843 ^ and
28844 ^ they call together
28845 ^ all the cohort.
28848 ^ and
28849 ^ they put on
28850 ^ him
28851 ^ purple,
28852 ^ and
28853 ^ placed on
28854 ^ him,
28855 ^ having twisted together
28856 ^ of thorns a crown,
28858 ^ and
28859 ^ they began
28860 ^ to salute
28861 ^ him,
28862 ^ hail,
28863 ^ king
28864 ^ of the jews!
28866 ^ and
28867 ^ they kept striking
28868 ^ his - head
28871 ^ with a reed,
28872 ^ and
28873 ^ spitting on
28874 ^ him;
28875 ^ and,
28876 ^ bending
28877 ^ the knees,
28879 ^ they were kneeling down
28880 ^ to him.
28881 ^ and
28882 ^ when
28883 ^ they had mocked
28884 ^ him,
28885 ^ they took off
28886 ^ him
28887 ^ the purple
28889 ^ and
28890 ^ put on
28891 ^ him
28892 ^ the garments his
28895 ^ and
28896 ^ they are leading out
28897 ^ him,
28898 ^ that

28921 ^ they bring
28922 ^ him
28923 ^ to - golgotha, a place
28927 ^ which
28928 ^ is

28932 ^ and
28933 ^ they were offering

28937 ^ he
28938 ^ however

28941 ^ and
28942 ^ having crucified
28943 ^ him,
28944 ^ also
28945 ^ they divided
28946 ^ the garments of him,
28949 ^ casting
28950 ^ lots
28951 ^ for them,
28953 ^ who
28954 ^ what
28955 ^ should take.
28956 ^ it was
28957 ^ then
28958 ^ [the] hour third,
28960 ^ and
28961 ^ they crucified
28962 ^ him.
28963 ^ and
28964 ^ there was
28965 ^ the inscription
28967 ^ of the accusation against him

28981 ^ one
28982 ^ at [the] right hand,
28984 ^ and one
28986 ^ at [the] left of him.
28989 ^ and
28990 ^ those passing by
28992 ^ were railing at
28993 ^ him,
28994 ^ shaking
28995 ^ the heads of them
28998 ^ and
28999 ^ saying,
29000 ^ aha!

29027 ^ others
29028 ^ he saved;
29029 ^ himself
29030 ^ not
29031 ^ he is able
29032 ^ to save.
29033 ^ the christ,

29038 ^ let him descend
29039 ^ now
29040 ^ from the cross,
29043 ^ that
29044 ^ we might see
29045 ^ and

29047 ^ and
29048 ^ those being crucified
29050 ^ with him
29052 ^ were upbraiding
29053 ^ him.
29054 ^ and
29055 ^ having arrived
29056 ^ [the] hour sixth,
29058 ^ darkness
29059 ^ came
29060 ^ over all the land,

29089 ^ to why

29093 ^ and
29094 ^ some
29095 ^ of those standing by,
29097 ^ having heard,
29098 ^ were saying,
29099 ^ behold,
29100 ^ elijah
29101 ^ he calls.

29123 ^ jesus,
29124 ^ having uttered
29125 ^ a cry loud,
29127 ^ breathed his last.
29128 ^ and
29129 ^ the veil
29131 ^ of the temple
29133 ^ was torn
29134 ^ into two
29136 ^ from top

29195 ^ and
29196 ^ other
29197 ^ many,
29198 ^ those having come up with
29200 ^ him
29201 ^ to jerusalem.
29203 ^ and
29204 ^ already
29205 ^ evening

29236 ^ the body
29238 ^ - of jesus.
29240 ^ -
29241 ^ and

29247 ^ and
29248 ^ having called to [him]
29249 ^ the centurion,
29251 ^ he questioned
29252 ^ him
29253 ^ whether

29255 ^ he had died.
29256 ^ and
29257 ^ having known [it]

29274 ^ and
29275 ^ laid
29276 ^ him
29277 ^ in a tomb
29279 ^ which
29280 ^ was
29281 ^ cut
29282 ^ out of a rock.
29284 ^ and
29285 ^ he rolled
29286 ^ a stone
29287 ^ to the door
29290 ^ of the tomb.
29292 ^ -
29293 ^ and

29297 ^ and mary
29299 ^ the [mother] of joseph
29301 ^ were watching
29302 ^ where
29303 ^ he was laid.
29304 ^ and

29309 ^ - magdalene,
29311 ^ and mary
29313 ^ the [mother]

29319 ^ spices,
29320 ^ that
29321 ^ having come,
29322 ^ they might anoint
29323 ^ him.
29324 ^ and
29325 ^ very early
29327 ^ on the first [day]
29329 ^ of the week,
29331 ^ they come
29332 ^ to the tomb,
29335 ^ having arisen
29336 ^ the sun.
29338 ^ and
29339 ^ they were saying
29340 ^ among themselves,
29342 ^ who
29343 ^ will roll away
29344 ^ for us
29345 ^ the stone
29347 ^ from the door
29350 ^ of the tomb?
29352 ^ and
29353 ^ having looked up
29354 ^ they see
29355 ^ that
29356 ^ has been rolled away
29357 ^ the stone;
29359 ^ it was
29360 ^ for
29361 ^ large extremely.
29363 ^ and
29364 ^ having entered
29365 ^ into the tomb,
29368 ^ they saw
29369 ^ a young man
29370 ^ sitting
29371 ^ on the right,
29374 ^ clothed in
29375 ^ a robe white,
29377 ^ and
29378 ^ they were greatly amazed.
29379 ^ -
29380 ^ and
29381 ^ he says
29382 ^ to them,
29383 ^ not
29384 ^ be amazed.
29385 ^ jesus
29386 ^ you seek,
29387 ^ the nazarene,
29389 ^ the [one] having been crucified.
29391 ^ he is risen!
29392 ^ not
29393 ^ he is
29394 ^ here!
29395 ^ behold
29396 ^ the place
29398 ^ where
29399 ^ they laid
29400 ^ him.
29401 ^ but
29402 ^ go,
29403 ^ say
29404 ^ the disciples of him
29407 ^ and - to peter
29410 ^ that
29411 ^ he goes before
29412 ^ you
29413 ^ into - galilee;
29416 ^ there
29417 ^ him
29418 ^ will you see,
29419 ^ as
29420 ^ he said
29421 ^ to you.
29422 ^ and
29423 ^ having gone out,
29424 ^ they fled
29425 ^ from the tomb.
29428 ^ had seized
29429 ^ for
29430 ^ them
29431 ^ trembling
29432 ^ and amazement,
29434 ^ and
29435 ^ to none
29436 ^ nothing
29437 ^ they spoke;
29438 ^ they were afraid
29439 ^ for.
29440 ^ having risen
29441 ^ now
29442 ^ early [the]
29443 ^ first [day] of the week,
29445 ^ he appeared
29446 ^ first
29447 ^ to mary
29448 ^ - magdalene,
29450 ^ from whom
29452 ^ he had cast out
29453 ^ seven demons.
29455 ^ she
29456 ^ having gone,
29457 ^ told [it]
29458 ^ to those
29459 ^ with him,
29461 ^ having been
29462 ^ mourning
29463 ^ and
29464 ^ weeping.
29465 ^ and they,
29466 ^ having heard
29467 ^ that
29468 ^ he is alive
29469 ^ and
29470 ^ has been seen
29471 ^ by her,
29473 ^ disbelieved.
29474 ^ after
29475 ^ now
29476 ^ these things,
29477 ^ to two
29478 ^ of them
29480 ^ as they are walking,
29481 ^ he appeared
29482 ^ in another form,
29485 ^ going
29486 ^ into [the] country.
29488 ^ and they,
29489 ^ having gone,
29490 ^ told [it]
29491 ^ to the rest;
29493 ^ neither
29494 ^ them
29495 ^ did they believe.
29496 ^ afterward
29497 ^ now
29498 ^ were reclining they; to the eleven
29502 ^ he appeared
29503 ^ and
29504 ^ rebuked
29505 ^ the unbelief of them
29508 ^ and hardness of heart,
29510 ^ because
29511 ^ those having seen
29513 ^ him
29514 ^ arisen
29515 ^ not
29516 ^ they believed.
29517 ^ and
29518 ^ he said
29519 ^ to them,
29520 ^ having gone
29521 ^ into the world all,
29525 ^ proclaim
29526 ^ the gospel
29528 ^ to all the creation.
29531 ^ the [one] having believed
29533 ^ and
29534 ^ having been baptized
29535 ^ will be saved;
29536 ^ the [one]
29537 ^ however
29538 ^ having disbelieved
29539 ^ will be condemned.
29540 ^ signs
29541 ^ now
29542 ^ those having believed
29544 ^ these
29545 ^ will accompany:
29546 ^ in the name of me
29550 ^ demons
29551 ^ they will cast out;
29552 ^ with tongues
29553 ^ they will speak
29554 ^ new;
29555 ^ and
29556 ^ with their hands
29559 ^ serpents
29560 ^ they will take up;
29561 ^ and if
29562 ^ deadly anything
29564 ^ they drink,
29565 ^ no not
29567 ^ them
29568 ^ shall it hurt;
29569 ^ upon [the] sick,
29571 ^ hands
29572 ^ they will lay,
29573 ^ and
29574 ^ well
29575 ^ they will be.
29576 ^ -
29577 ^ indeed
29578 ^ therefore
29579 ^ the lord jesus,
29581 ^ after - speaking
29584 ^ to them,
29585 ^ was taken up
29586 ^ into the heaven
29589 ^ and
29590 ^ sat
29591 ^ at [the] right hand
29593 ^ - of god.
29595 ^ they
29596 ^ now
29597 ^ having gone forth,
29598 ^ preached
29599 ^ everywhere,
29600 ^ the lord
29602 ^ working with [them]
29603 ^ and
29604 ^ the word
29606 ^ confirming
29607 ^ by the
29609 ^ accompanying signs.
29611 ^ all
29612 ^ moreover
29613 ^ the [things] being instructed
29615 ^ to [those]
29616 ^ around - peter.
29619 ^ promptly
29620 ^ they reported
29621 ^ after
29622 ^ moreover,
29623 ^ these,
29624 ^ also
29625 ^ himself - jesus
29628 ^ from [the] east
29630 ^ and
29631 ^ to [the] west,
29633 ^ sent out
29634 ^ through them,
29636 ^ the sacred
29638 ^ and
29639 ^ imperishable
29640 ^ preaching
29641 ^ of eternal salvation.
29644 ^ amen.
29645 ^ inasmuch as
29646 ^ many
29647 ^ have undertaken
29648 ^ to draw up
29649 ^ a narration
29650 ^ concerning the
29652 ^ having been accomplished
29653 ^ among us things,
29656 ^ as
29657 ^ delivered [them]
29658 ^ to us
29659 ^ those
29660 ^ from [the] beginning
29662 ^ eyewitnesses
29663 ^ and servants
29665 ^ having been
29666 ^ of the word,
29668 ^ it seemed good
29669 ^ also to me,
29670 ^ having been acquainted
29671 ^ from the first
29672 ^ with all things,
29673 ^ carefully
29674 ^ with method
29675 ^ to you
29676 ^ to write,
29677 ^ most excellent theophilus,
29679 ^ so that
29680 ^ you may know
29681 ^ concerning which
29683 ^ you were instructed, [of the] things, the certainty.
29687 ^ there was
29688 ^ in the days
29691 ^ of herod
29692 ^ king
29693 ^ - of judea
29695 ^ a priest
29696 ^ certain,
29697 ^ named zechariah,
29699 ^ of [the] division of abijah,
29702 ^ and
29703 ^ wife of him
29705 ^ of the daughters of aaron,
29709 ^ and
29710 ^ the name of her
29713 ^ elizabeth.
29714 ^ they were
29715 ^ now
29716 ^ righteous
29717 ^ both
29718 ^ before - god,
29721 ^ walking
29722 ^ in all the commandments
29726 ^ and ordinances
29728 ^ of the lord
29730 ^ blameless.
29731 ^ and
29732 ^ no
29733 ^ there was
29734 ^ to them
29735 ^ child,
29736 ^ inasmuch as
29737 ^ was
29738 ^ - elizabeth
29740 ^ barren,
29741 ^ and
29742 ^ both
29743 ^ advanced
29744 ^ in the years of them
29748 ^ were.
29749 ^ it came to pass
29750 ^ now
29751 ^ in the fulfilling the priestly service
29754 ^ of him,
29755 ^ in the order
29758 ^ of the division of him
29761 ^ before - god,
29764 ^ according to the custom
29767 ^ of the priesthood,
29769 ^ it fell to him by lot
29770 ^ - to burn incense,
29772 ^ having entered
29773 ^ into the temple
29776 ^ of the lord.
29778 ^ and
29779 ^ all the multitude
29782 ^ were
29783 ^ of the people
29785 ^ praying
29786 ^ outside
29787 ^ at the hour
29789 ^ of the incense.
29791 ^ appeared
29792 ^ then
29793 ^ to him
29794 ^ an angel of [the] lord,
29796 ^ standing
29797 ^ at [the] right
29799 ^ of the altar
29801 ^ of the incense.
29803 ^ and
29804 ^ was troubled
29805 ^ zechariah
29806 ^ having seen [him],
29807 ^ and
29808 ^ fear
29809 ^ fell
29810 ^ upon him.
29812 ^ said
29813 ^ then
29814 ^ to him
29816 ^ the angel,
29818 ^ not
29819 ^ fear,
29820 ^ zechariah,
29821 ^ because
29822 ^ has been heard
29823 ^ the prayer of you,
29826 ^ and
29827 ^ the wife of you elizabeth
29831 ^ will bear

32504 ^ to nazareth,
32506 ^ where
32507 ^ he had been
32508 ^ brought up;
32509 ^ and
32510 ^ he entered
32511 ^ according to the custom to him,
32515 ^ on the day
32518 ^ of the sabbaths,
32520 ^ into the synagogue,
32523 ^ and
32524 ^ stood up
32525 ^ to read.
32526 ^ and
32527 ^ there was given
32528 ^ to him
32529 ^ [the] scroll of
32530 ^ the prophet isaiah,
32533 ^ and
32534 ^ having unrolled
32535 ^ the scroll,
32537 ^ he found
32538 ^ the place
32540 ^ where
32541 ^ it was
32542 ^ written:
32543 ^ [the] spirit of [the] lord [is]
32545 ^ upon me,
32547 ^ of which because
32549 ^ he has anointed
32550 ^ me
32551 ^ to preach good news
32552 ^ to [the] poor.
32553 ^ he has sent
32554 ^ me
32555 ^ to proclaim
32556 ^ to [the] captives deliverance,
32558 ^ and to [the] blind recovery of sight,
32561 ^ to send forth

32567 ^ of [the] lord’s favor.”
32569 ^ and
32570 ^ having rolled up
32571 ^ the scroll,
32573 ^ having delivered [it]
32574 ^ to the attendant,
32576 ^ he sat down,

32581 ^ in the synagogue
32584 ^ were
32585 ^ fixed upon
32586 ^ him.

32598 ^ in the hearing of you.
32602 ^ and
32603 ^ all
32604 ^ were bearing witness
32605 ^ to him
32606 ^ and
32607 ^ marveling
32608 ^ at the words
32611 ^ of the grace
32613 ^ that are proceeding
32615 ^ out of the mouth of him;
32619 ^ and
32620 ^ they were saying,

32622 ^ the son
32623 ^ is
32624 ^ of joseph
32625 ^ this?
32626 ^ and
32627 ^ he said
32628 ^ to them,
32630 ^ surely
32631 ^ you will say
32632 ^ to me
32633 ^ the proverb this,

32645 ^ do
32646 ^ also
32647 ^ here
32648 ^ in the hometown of you.
32652 ^ he said
32653 ^ then,
32654 ^ truly
32655 ^ i say
32656 ^ to you
32657 ^ that
32658 ^ no prophet

32662 ^ in the hometown of him.
32666 ^ in truth
32668 ^ now
32669 ^ i say
32670 ^ to you,
32671 ^ many widows
32673 ^ there were
32674 ^ in the days of elijah
32678 ^ in - israel,
32681 ^ when
32682 ^ was shut up
32683 ^ the heaven
32685 ^ for years three
32688 ^ and months six,
32691 ^ when
32692 ^ there was
32693 ^ a famine great
32695 ^ upon all the land;
32699 ^ and
32700 ^ to none of them
32703 ^ was sent
32704 ^ elijah,
32705 ^ if
32706 ^ not
32707 ^ to zarephath
32709 ^ - of sidon,
32711 ^ to a woman, a widow.
32714 ^ and
32715 ^ many lepers
32717 ^ were
32718 ^ in - israel
32721 ^ in the time of elisha
32723 ^ the prophet,
32725 ^ and
32726 ^ none of them

32737 ^ with anger
32738 ^ in the synagogue,
32741 ^ hearing
32742 ^ these things;
32743 ^ and
32744 ^ having risen up,
32745 ^ they cast
32746 ^ him
32747 ^ out of [the] city
32750 ^ and
32751 ^ led
32752 ^ him
32753 ^ unto brow
32755 ^ of the hill
32757 ^ upon which
32759 ^ the town
32761 ^ had been built
32762 ^ of them,
32763 ^ in order
32764 ^ to throw over

32766 ^ he
32767 ^ however,
32768 ^ having passed
32769 ^ through [the] midst of them,
32772 ^ went away.
32773 ^ and
32774 ^ he went down
32775 ^ to capernaum,
32777 ^ a city
32778 ^ - of galilee.
32780 ^ and
32781 ^ he was
32782 ^ teaching
32783 ^ them
32784 ^ on the sabbaths;
32787 ^ and
32788 ^ they were astonished
32789 ^ at the teaching of him,
32793 ^ for
32794 ^ with authority
32796 ^ was
32797 ^ the message of him.
32800 ^ and
32801 ^ in the synagogue
32804 ^ was
32805 ^ a man
32806 ^ having
32807 ^ a spirit
32808 ^ of a demon unclean;
32810 ^ and
32811 ^ he cried out

35671 ^ from each town
35673 ^ are coming
35674 ^ to him,
35676 ^ he spoke
35677 ^ by a parable:
35679 ^ went out
35680 ^ the [one] sowing
35682 ^ - to sow
35684 ^ the seed of him.
35687 ^ and
35688 ^ in the sowing

35692 ^ some
35693 ^ indeed
35694 ^ fell
35695 ^ along the road,

35700 ^ and
35701 ^ the birds
35703 ^ of the air
35705 ^ devoured
35706 ^ it.
35707 ^ and

35710 ^ upon the rock,
35713 ^ and

35720 ^ moisture.
35721 ^ and

35736 ^ fell
35737 ^ upon the soil
35740 ^ - good,
35742 ^ and
35743 ^ having sprung up,
35744 ^ it produced
35745 ^ fruit
35746 ^ a hundredfold.
35747 ^ these things
35748 ^ saying,
35749 ^ he was calling out,

35803 ^ those
35804 ^ now
35805 ^ along the road

35813 ^ the devil
35815 ^ and

35849 ^ and

35953 ^ might have,
35954 ^ even
35955 ^ what
35956 ^ he seems
35957 ^ to have
35958 ^ will be taken away
35959 ^ from him.
35961 ^ came
35962 ^ then
35963 ^ to him
35965 ^ the mother
35967 ^ and the brothers of him,
35971 ^ and
35972 ^ not
35973 ^ they were able
35974 ^ to get
35975 ^ to him,
35976 ^ because of the crowd.
35979 ^ it was told

35994 ^ -
35995 ^ but
35996 ^ answering,
35997 ^ he said
35998 ^ to them,
36000 ^ mother of me
36002 ^ and brothers of me,
36005 ^ those
36006 ^ are
36007 ^ who

36010 ^ - of god
36012 ^ are hearing
36013 ^ and
36014 ^ doing.
36015 ^ it came to pass
36016 ^ then,
36017 ^ on one
36019 ^ of the days
36021 ^ also
36022 ^ he
36023 ^ entered
36024 ^ into a boat
36026 ^ with
36027 ^ the disciples of him,
36030 ^ and
36031 ^ he said
36032 ^ to them,
36034 ^ let us pass over
36035 ^ to the other side
36038 ^ of the lake.
36040 ^ and
36041 ^ they launched out.
36042 ^ sailing
36043 ^ then
36044 ^ of them,
36045 ^ he fell asleep.
36046 ^ and
36047 ^ came down
36048 ^ a storm of wind
36050 ^ on the lake,
36053 ^ and
36054 ^ they were being swamped
36055 ^ and
36056 ^ were in danger.
36057 ^ having come to [him]
36058 ^ then,
36059 ^ they awoke
36060 ^ him,
36061 ^ saying,
36062 ^ master,
36063 ^ master,
36064 ^ we are perishing!
36065 ^ -
36066 ^ and
36067 ^ having arisen,
36068 ^ he rebuked
36069 ^ the wind
36071 ^ and the raging
36074 ^ of the water,
36076 ^ and
36077 ^ they ceased,
36078 ^ and
36079 ^ there was
36080 ^ a calm.
36081 ^ he said
36082 ^ then
36083 ^ to them,
36084 ^ where is
36085 ^ the faith of you?
36088 ^ having been afraid
36089 ^ then,
36090 ^ they marveled,
36091 ^ saying
36092 ^ to one another,
36094 ^ who
36095 ^ then
36096 ^ this
36097 ^ is,
36098 ^ that
36099 ^ even
36100 ^ the winds
36102 ^ he commands
36103 ^ and the water,
36106 ^ and
36107 ^ they obey
36108 ^ him?
36109 ^ and
36110 ^ they sailed down
36111 ^ to the region
36114 ^ of the gerasenes,
36116 ^ which
36117 ^ is
36118 ^ opposite - galilee.
36121 ^ having gone forth
36122 ^ then
36123 ^ he
36124 ^ upon the land,
36127 ^ met [him]
36128 ^ a man
36129 ^ certain
36130 ^ out of the city,
36133 ^ having
36134 ^ demons,
36135 ^ and

36140 ^ clothing,
36141 ^ and
36142 ^ in a house
36144 ^ not

36150 ^ having seen
36151 ^ then
36152 ^ - jesus,
36154 ^ having cried out,
36155 ^ he fell down before
36156 ^ him,
36157 ^ and
36158 ^ in a voice loud
36160 ^ said,
36161 ^ what
36162 ^ to me
36163 ^ and to you,
36165 ^ jesus,
36166 ^ son
36167 ^ - of god,
36169 ^ the most high?
36171 ^ i implore
36172 ^ of you
36173 ^ not
36174 ^ me
36175 ^ you might torment!
36176 ^ he was commanding
36177 ^ for
36178 ^ the spirit
36180 ^ - unclean
36182 ^ to come out
36183 ^ from the man.
36186 ^ many
36187 ^ for
36188 ^ times
36189 ^ it had seized
36190 ^ him,
36191 ^ and
36192 ^ he was bound,
36193 ^ with chains
36194 ^ and shackles
36196 ^ being kept;
36197 ^ and
36198 ^ breaking
36199 ^ the chains,
36201 ^ he was driven
36202 ^ by the demon
36205 ^ into the deserts.
36208 ^ asked
36209 ^ now
36210 ^ him
36211 ^ - jesus,
36213 ^ what
36214 ^ your name
36216 ^ is?
36217 ^ -
36218 ^ and
36219 ^ he said,
36220 ^ legion,
36221 ^ because
36222 ^ were entered
36223 ^ demons many
36225 ^ into him.
36227 ^ and
36228 ^ they were begging
36229 ^ him,
36230 ^ that
36231 ^ not
36232 ^ he would command
36233 ^ them
36234 ^ into the abyss
36237 ^ to go away.
36238 ^ there was
36239 ^ now
36240 ^ there
36241 ^ a herd
36242 ^ of pigs many
36244 ^ feeding,
36245 ^ in the mountain,
36248 ^ and
36249 ^ they begged
36250 ^ him
36251 ^ that
36252 ^ he would allow
36253 ^ them
36254 ^ into them
36256 ^ to enter;
36257 ^ and
36258 ^ he allowed
36259 ^ them.
36260 ^ having gone out
36261 ^ then
36262 ^ the demons
36264 ^ from the man,
36267 ^ they entered
36268 ^ into the pigs,
36271 ^ and
36272 ^ rushed
36273 ^ the herd
36275 ^ down the steep bank
36278 ^ into the lake
36281 ^ and
36282 ^ was drowned.
36283 ^ having seen
36284 ^ then
36285 ^ those feeding [them]
36287 ^ that having taken place,
36289 ^ they fled
36290 ^ and
36291 ^ reported [it]

36299 ^ they went out
36300 ^ then
36301 ^ to see

36304 ^ and
36305 ^ they came
36306 ^ to - jesus
36309 ^ and
36310 ^ found
36311 ^ sitting the man
36314 ^ from whom
36316 ^ the demons
36318 ^ had gone out,
36319 ^ clothed
36320 ^ and
36321 ^ being of sound mind,
36322 ^ at the feet
36325 ^ - of jesus.
36327 ^ and
36328 ^ they were afraid.

36330 ^ then
36331 ^ to them
36332 ^ those having seen [it],
36334 ^ how
36335 ^ was healed

36344 ^ of the surrounding region
36346 ^ of the gerasenes
36348 ^ to depart

36543 ^ she came,
36544 ^ and
36545 ^ having fallen down before
36546 ^ him,
36547 ^ for what cause
36550 ^ she touched
36551 ^ him
36552 ^ she declared
36553 ^ before all the people,
36557 ^ and
36558 ^ how
36559 ^ she was healed
36560 ^ immediately.
36561 ^ -
36562 ^ and
36563 ^ he said
36564 ^ to her,
36565 ^ daughter,
36566 ^ the faith of you
36569 ^ has healed
36570 ^ you;
36571 ^ go
36572 ^ in peace.
36574 ^ still
36575 ^ of him
36576 ^ speaking,
36577 ^ comes
36578 ^ one
36579 ^ from the synagogue ruler,
36582 ^ saying
36583 ^ -,
36584 ^ has died
36585 ^ the daughter of you;
36588 ^ no longer
36589 ^ trouble
36590 ^ the teacher.
36592 ^ -
36593 ^ but
36594 ^ jesus
36595 ^ having heard,
36596 ^ answered
36597 ^ him,
36598 ^ not
36599 ^ fear;
36600 ^ only
36601 ^ believe,
36602 ^ and
36603 ^ she will be saved.
36604 ^ having entered
36605 ^ then
36606 ^ into the house,
36609 ^ not
36610 ^ he did allow
36611 ^ to go in
36612 ^ anyone
36613 ^ with him,
36615 ^ if
36616 ^ not
36617 ^ peter,
36618 ^ and john,
36620 ^ and james,
36622 ^ and the father
36625 ^ of the child,
36627 ^ and the mother.
36630 ^ they were weeping
36631 ^ now
36632 ^ all
36633 ^ and
36634 ^ mourning for
36635 ^ her.
36636 ^ -
36637 ^ but
36638 ^ he said,
36639 ^ not
36640 ^ weep;
36641 ^ not
36642 ^ for
36643 ^ she is dead,
36644 ^ but
36645 ^ sleeps.
36646 ^ and
36647 ^ they were laughing at
36648 ^ him,
36649 ^ knowing
36650 ^ that
36651 ^ she was dead.
36652 ^ he
36653 ^ now,
36654 ^ having taken hold
36655 ^ of the hand of her,
36658 ^ called out,
36659 ^ saying
36660 ^ -, child,
36662 ^ arise!
36663 ^ and
36664 ^ returned
36665 ^ the spirit of her,
36668 ^ and
36669 ^ she arose
36670 ^ immediately;
36671 ^ and
36672 ^ he directed
36673 ^ to her
36674 ^ to be given
36675 ^ to eat.
36676 ^ and
36677 ^ were amazed
36678 ^ the parents of her;
36681 ^ -
36682 ^ and
36683 ^ he instructed
36684 ^ them
36685 ^ no one
36686 ^ to tell
36687 ^ what had happened.
36689 ^ having called together
36690 ^ then
36691 ^ the twelve,
36693 ^ he gave
36694 ^ to them
36695 ^ power
36696 ^ and authority
36698 ^ over all the demons,
36702 ^ and
36703 ^ diseases
36704 ^ to heal,
36705 ^ and
36706 ^ he sent
36707 ^ them
36708 ^ to proclaim
36709 ^ the kingdom
36711 ^ - of god
36713 ^ and
36714 ^ to heal
36715 ^ the sick,
36717 ^ and
36718 ^ he said
36719 ^ to them,
36721 ^ nothing
36722 ^ take
36723 ^ for the journey;
36726 ^ neither
36727 ^ staff,
36728 ^ nor bag,
36730 ^ nor bread,
36732 ^ nor money,
36734 ^ nor apiece two tunics
36738 ^ to have.
36739 ^ and
36740 ^ into whatever
36742 ^ -
36743 ^ house
36744 ^ you might enter,
36745 ^ there
36746 ^ remain,
36747 ^ and
36748 ^ from there
36749 ^ go forth.
36750 ^ and
36751 ^ as many as
36752 ^ -
36753 ^ not
36754 ^ might receive
36755 ^ you,
36756 ^ going forth
36757 ^ from the city that,
36761 ^ the dust
36763 ^ from the feet of you
36767 ^ shake off,
36768 ^ as a testimony
36770 ^ against them.
36772 ^ going forth
36773 ^ then,
36774 ^ they were passing
36775 ^ through the villages,
36778 ^ proclaiming the gospel
36779 ^ and
36780 ^ healing
36781 ^ everywhere.
36782 ^ heard of
36783 ^ now
36784 ^ herod
36785 ^ the tetrarch
36787 ^ the things being done all,
36790 ^ and
36791 ^ was perplexed,
36792 ^ because - it was said
36795 ^ by some
36797 ^ -
36798 ^ john
36799 ^ has been raised
36800 ^ out from [the] dead,
36802 ^ by some
36804 ^ also
36805 ^ that
36806 ^ elijah
36807 ^ had appeared,
36808 ^ by others
36809 ^ also
36810 ^ that
36811 ^ a prophet one
36813 ^ of the ancients
36815 ^ had arisen.
36816 ^ said
36817 ^ then
36818 ^ herod,
36819 ^ john
36820 ^ i
36821 ^ beheaded;
36822 ^ who
36823 ^ however
36824 ^ is
36825 ^ this
36826 ^ concerning whom
36828 ^ i hear
36829 ^ such things?
36830 ^ and
36831 ^ he was seeking
36832 ^ to see
36833 ^ him.
36834 ^ and
36835 ^ having returned,
36836 ^ the apostles
36838 ^ related
36839 ^ to him
36840 ^ whatever
36841 ^ they had done.
36842 ^ and
36843 ^ having taken
36844 ^ them,
36845 ^ he withdrew
36846 ^ by himself
36848 ^ into a town
36850 ^ called
36851 ^ bethsaida.
36852 ^ the
36853 ^ now
36854 ^ crowds
36855 ^ having known [it],
36856 ^ followed
36857 ^ him;
36858 ^ and
36859 ^ having received
36860 ^ them,
36861 ^ he was speaking
36862 ^ to them
36863 ^ concerning the kingdom
36866 ^ - of god,
36868 ^ and
36869 ^ those
36870 ^ need
36871 ^ having
36872 ^ of healing,
36873 ^ he was healing.
36874 ^ -
36875 ^ and
36876 ^ the day
36877 ^ began
36878 ^ to decline;
36879 ^ having come
36880 ^ then
36881 ^ the twelve
36883 ^ said
36884 ^ to him,
36885 ^ dismiss
36886 ^ the crowd,
36888 ^ that
36889 ^ having gone
36890 ^ into the surrounding villages
36894 ^ and countryside
36896 ^ they might lodge,
36897 ^ and
36898 ^ might find
36899 ^ provisions;
36900 ^ for
36901 ^ here
36902 ^ in a desolate place
36905 ^ we are.
36906 ^ he said
36907 ^ now
36908 ^ to them,
36910 ^ give
36911 ^ to them
36912 ^ you.
36913 ^ to eat
36914 ^ -
36915 ^ but
36916 ^ they said,
36917 ^ not
36918 ^ there are
36919 ^ to us
36920 ^ more
36921 ^ than loaves five,
36924 ^ and fish two,
36927 ^ if
36928 ^ not
36929 ^ having gone,
36930 ^ we
36931 ^ should buy
36932 ^ for all the people this
36937 ^ food.
36938 ^ they were
36939 ^ for
36940 ^ about men five thousand.
36943 ^ he said
36944 ^ then
36945 ^ to the disciples of him,
36949 ^ make sit down
36950 ^ them,
36951 ^ groups
36952 ^ of about in fifty.
36955 ^ and
36956 ^ they did
36957 ^ so
36958 ^ and
36959 ^ made sit down
36960 ^ all.
36961 ^ having taken
36962 ^ then
36963 ^ the five loaves
36966 ^ and the two fish,
36970 ^ having looked up
36971 ^ to the heaven,
36974 ^ he blessed
36975 ^ them
36976 ^ and
36977 ^ broke [them],
36978 ^ and
36979 ^ he kept giving [them]
36980 ^ to the disciples
36982 ^ to set before
36983 ^ the crowd.
36985 ^ and
36986 ^ they ate
36987 ^ and
36988 ^ were satisfied
36989 ^ all;
36990 ^ and
36991 ^ was taken up
36992 ^ that having been a surplus
36994 ^ to them of fragments, hand-baskets twelve.
36998 ^ and
36999 ^ it came to pass
37000 ^ as - was
37003 ^ he
37004 ^ praying
37005 ^ in solitary,
37007 ^ were with
37008 ^ him
37009 ^ the disciples,
37011 ^ and
37012 ^ he questioned
37013 ^ them,
37014 ^ saying,
37015 ^ whom
37016 ^ me
37017 ^ do pronounce
37018 ^ the crowds
37020 ^ to be?
37021 ^ -
37022 ^ and
37023 ^ answering,
37024 ^ they said,
37025 ^ john
37026 ^ the baptist;
37028 ^ others
37029 ^ also,
37030 ^ elijah;
37031 ^ others
37032 ^ now,
37033 ^ that
37034 ^ a prophet, one
37036 ^ of the ancients,
37038 ^ has arisen.
37039 ^ he said
37040 ^ then
37041 ^ to them,
37042 ^ you
37043 ^ however,
37044 ^ whom
37045 ^ me
37046 ^ do pronounce
37047 ^ to be?
37048 ^ peter
37049 ^ then
37050 ^ answering
37051 ^ said,
37052 ^ the christ
37054 ^ - of god.
37056 ^ -
37057 ^ and
37058 ^ having strictly warned
37059 ^ them,
37060 ^ he instructed [them]
37061 ^ to no one
37062 ^ to tell
37063 ^ this,
37064 ^ having said
37065 ^ -,
37066 ^ it is necessary for
37067 ^ the son
37069 ^ - of man
37071 ^ many things
37072 ^ to suffer,
37073 ^ and
37074 ^ to be rejected
37075 ^ by the elders
37078 ^ and chief priests
37080 ^ and scribes,
37082 ^ and
37083 ^ to be killed,
37084 ^ and
37085 ^ on the third day
37088 ^ to be raised.
37089 ^ he was saying
37090 ^ then
37091 ^ to all,
37093 ^ if
37094 ^ anyone
37095 ^ desires
37096 ^ after me
37098 ^ to come,
37099 ^ let him deny
37100 ^ himself,
37101 ^ and
37102 ^ let him take up
37103 ^ the cross of him
37106 ^ every day,
37108 ^ and
37109 ^ let him follow
37110 ^ me.
37111 ^ whoever
37112 ^ for
37113 ^ -
37114 ^ might desire
37115 ^ the life of him
37118 ^ to save,
37119 ^ will lose
37120 ^ it;
37121 ^ whoever
37122 ^ however
37123 ^ -
37124 ^ might lose
37125 ^ the life of him
37128 ^ on account of me,
37130 ^ he
37131 ^ will save
37132 ^ it.
37133 ^ what
37134 ^ for
37135 ^ is profited
37136 ^ a man,
37137 ^ having gained
37138 ^ the world whole,
37141 ^ himself
37142 ^ now
37143 ^ having destroyed,
37144 ^ or
37145 ^ having suffered the loss of?
37146 ^ whoever
37147 ^ for
37148 ^ -
37149 ^ may have been ashamed of
37150 ^ me
37151 ^ and - my words,
37155 ^ him
37156 ^ the son
37158 ^ - of man
37160 ^ will be ashamed of
37161 ^ when
37162 ^ he shall come
37163 ^ in the glory
37166 ^ of himself,
37167 ^ and of the father,
37170 ^ and of the holy angels.
37174 ^ i say
37175 ^ now
37176 ^ to you
37177 ^ truthfully,
37178 ^ there are
37179 ^ some
37180 ^ of those
37181 ^ here
37182 ^ standing,
37183 ^ who
37184 ^ no not
37186 ^ shall taste
37187 ^ of death
37188 ^ until
37189 ^ -
37190 ^ they shall have seen
37191 ^ the kingdom
37193 ^ - of god.
37195 ^ it came to pass
37196 ^ now
37197 ^ after the sayings these,
37201 ^ about days eight,
37204 ^ and
37205 ^ having taken
37206 ^ peter
37207 ^ and john
37209 ^ and james,
37211 ^ he went up
37212 ^ on the mountain
37215 ^ to pray.
37216 ^ and
37217 ^ it came to pass
37218 ^ in the praying
37221 ^ of him,
37222 ^ the appearance
37224 ^ of the face of him
37227 ^ [was] altered,
37228 ^ and
37229 ^ the clothing of him
37232 ^ white
37233 ^ became dazzling.
37234 ^ and
37235 ^ behold,
37236 ^ men two
37238 ^ began talking with
37239 ^ him,
37240 ^ who
37241 ^ were
37242 ^ moses
37243 ^ and elijah.
37245 ^ those
37246 ^ having appeared
37247 ^ in glory
37249 ^ were speaking of
37250 ^ the going out of him,
37253 ^ which
37254 ^ he was about
37255 ^ to accomplish
37256 ^ in jerusalem.
37258 ^ -
37259 ^ and
37260 ^ peter
37261 ^ and those
37263 ^ with him
37265 ^ were
37266 ^ heavy
37267 ^ with sleep;
37268 ^ having awoken fully
37269 ^ then
37270 ^ they saw
37271 ^ the glory of him,
37274 ^ and the two men
37278 ^ - standing with
37280 ^ him.
37281 ^ and
37282 ^ it came to pass
37283 ^ in the departing
37286 ^ of them
37287 ^ from him,
37289 ^ said
37290 ^ - peter
37292 ^ to - jesus,
37295 ^ master,
37296 ^ good
37297 ^ it is
37298 ^ for us
37299 ^ here
37300 ^ to be;
37301 ^ also
37302 ^ let us make
37303 ^ tabernacles
37304 ^ three:
37305 ^ one for you,
37307 ^ and one for moses,
37310 ^ and one for elijah,
37313 ^ not
37314 ^ knowing
37315 ^ what
37316 ^ he is saying.
37317 ^ these things
37318 ^ then
37319 ^ as he
37320 ^ is saying,
37321 ^ came
37322 ^ a cloud
37323 ^ and
37324 ^ was overshadowing
37325 ^ them;
37326 ^ they feared
37327 ^ then
37328 ^ in the entering
37331 ^ of them
37332 ^ into the cloud.
37335 ^ and
37336 ^ a voice
37337 ^ came
37338 ^ out of the cloud,
37341 ^ saying,
37342 ^ this
37343 ^ is
37344 ^ the son of me,
37347 ^ - whom i have chosen;
37349 ^ him
37350 ^ listen to!
37351 ^ and
37352 ^ as - occurred
37355 ^ the voice,
37357 ^ was found
37358 ^ jesus
37359 ^ alone.
37360 ^ and
37361 ^ they
37362 ^ were silent,
37363 ^ and
37364 ^ to no one
37365 ^ they told
37366 ^ in those the days
37370 ^ anything
37371 ^ of what
37372 ^ they had seen.
37373 ^ it came to pass
37374 ^ then
37375 ^ the next day,
37378 ^ on having come down
37379 ^ of them
37380 ^ from the mountain,
37383 ^ met
37384 ^ him
37385 ^ a crowd great.
37387 ^ and
37388 ^ behold,
37389 ^ a man
37390 ^ from the crowd
37393 ^ cried out,
37394 ^ saying,
37395 ^ teacher,
37396 ^ i implore
37397 ^ you
37398 ^ to look
37399 ^ upon the son of me,
37403 ^ for
37404 ^ an only child to me
37406 ^ he is.
37407 ^ and
37408 ^ behold,
37409 ^ a spirit
37410 ^ takes
37411 ^ him,
37412 ^ and
37413 ^ suddenly
37414 ^ he cries out,
37415 ^ and
37416 ^ it throws into convulsions
37417 ^ him
37418 ^ with foaming,
37420 ^ and
37421 ^ with difficulty
37422 ^ it departs
37423 ^ from him,
37425 ^ bruising
37426 ^ him.
37427 ^ and
37428 ^ i begged
37429 ^ the disciples of you
37432 ^ that
37433 ^ they might cast out
37434 ^ it,
37435 ^ and
37436 ^ not
37437 ^ they were able.
37438 ^ answering
37439 ^ now,
37440 ^ - jesus
37442 ^ said,
37443 ^ o generation
37445 ^ unbelieving
37446 ^ and perverted,
37448 ^ until when
37450 ^ will i be
37451 ^ with you
37453 ^ and
37454 ^ bear with
37455 ^ you?
37456 ^ bring
37457 ^ here
37458 ^ the son of you.
37461 ^ while
37462 ^ then
37463 ^ he was coming near
37464 ^ of him,
37465 ^ threw down
37466 ^ him
37467 ^ the demon
37469 ^ and
37470 ^ threw [him] into convulsions.
37471 ^ rebuked
37472 ^ then
37473 ^ - jesus
37475 ^ the spirit
37477 ^ - unclean,
37479 ^ and
37480 ^ healed
37481 ^ the boy,
37483 ^ and
37484 ^ gave back
37485 ^ him
37486 ^ to father of him.
37489 ^ were astonished
37490 ^ then
37491 ^ all
37492 ^ at the majesty
37495 ^ - of god.
37497 ^ of all
37498 ^ however
37499 ^ wondering
37500 ^ at all
37502 ^ which
37503 ^ he did,
37504 ^ he said
37505 ^ to the disciples of him,
37509 ^ let sink
37510 ^ you
37511 ^ into the ears of you
37515 ^ the words these;
37518 ^ -
37519 ^ for
37520 ^ the son
37521 ^ - of man
37523 ^ is about
37524 ^ to be betrayed
37525 ^ into [the] hands of men.
37528 ^ -
37529 ^ but
37530 ^ they understand not
37531 ^ the saying this,
37534 ^ and
37535 ^ it was
37536 ^ veiled
37537 ^ from them,
37539 ^ that
37540 ^ not
37541 ^ they should understand
37542 ^ it.
37543 ^ and
37544 ^ they were afraid
37545 ^ to ask
37546 ^ him
37547 ^ concerning the saying this.
37551 ^ came up
37552 ^ then
37553 ^ an argument
37554 ^ among them,
37556 ^ this,
37557 ^ who
37558 ^ -
37559 ^ might be
37560 ^ greatest of them.
37562 ^ -
37563 ^ but
37564 ^ jesus,
37565 ^ having known
37566 ^ the reasoning
37568 ^ of the heart of them,
37571 ^ having taken hold of
37572 ^ a child,
37573 ^ set
37574 ^ it
37575 ^ by him,
37577 ^ and
37578 ^ he said
37579 ^ to them,
37580 ^ whoever
37581 ^ if
37582 ^ shall receive
37583 ^ this - child
37586 ^ in the name of me,
37590 ^ me
37591 ^ receives;
37592 ^ and
37593 ^ whoever
37594 ^ -
37595 ^ me
37596 ^ shall receive,
37597 ^ receives
37598 ^ the [one] having sent
37600 ^ me.
37601 ^ the [one]
37602 ^ for
37603 ^ least
37604 ^ among all you
37607 ^ being,
37608 ^ he
37609 ^ shall be
37610 ^ great.
37611 ^ answering
37612 ^ now,
37613 ^ john
37614 ^ said,
37615 ^ master,
37616 ^ we saw
37617 ^ someone
37618 ^ in the name of you
37622 ^ casting out
37623 ^ demons,
37624 ^ and
37625 ^ we were forbidding
37626 ^ him,
37627 ^ because
37628 ^ not
37629 ^ he follows
37630 ^ with us.
37632 ^ said
37633 ^ then
37634 ^ to him
37636 ^ - jesus,
37638 ^ not
37639 ^ forbid;
37640 ^ whoever
37641 ^ for
37642 ^ not
37643 ^ is
37644 ^ against you,
37646 ^ for you
37648 ^ is.
37649 ^ it came to pass
37650 ^ then
37651 ^ in the completing
37654 ^ the days
37656 ^ of the ascension of him,
37659 ^ that
37660 ^ he
37661 ^ the face
37663 ^ steadfastly set
37664 ^ - to go
37666 ^ to jerusalem.
37668 ^ and
37669 ^ he sent
37670 ^ messengers
37671 ^ before [the] face of him.
37674 ^ and
37675 ^ having gone,
37676 ^ they entered
37677 ^ into a village of the samaritans,
37680 ^ so as
37681 ^ to make ready
37682 ^ for him.
37683 ^ and
37684 ^ not
37685 ^ they did receive
37686 ^ him,
37687 ^ because
37688 ^ the face of him
37691 ^ was [as]
37692 ^ going
37693 ^ toward jerusalem.
37695 ^ having seen [it]
37696 ^ now,
37697 ^ the disciples
37699 ^ james
37700 ^ and john
37702 ^ said,
37703 ^ lord,
37704 ^ will you [that]
37705 ^ we should call
37706 ^ fire
37707 ^ to come down
37708 ^ from - heaven
37711 ^ and
37712 ^ to consume
37713 ^ them?”
37714 ^ having turned
37715 ^ then,
37716 ^ he rebuked
37717 ^ them.
37718 ^ and
37719 ^ they went
37720 ^ to another village.
37723 ^ and
37724 ^ going
37725 ^ of them
37726 ^ along the road,
37729 ^ said
37730 ^ someone
37731 ^ to him,
37733 ^ i will follow
37734 ^ you
37735 ^ wherever
37736 ^ if
37737 ^ you may go.
37738 ^ and
37739 ^ said
37740 ^ to him
37741 ^ - jesus,
37743 ^ the foxes
37745 ^ holes
37746 ^ have,
37747 ^ and
37748 ^ the birds
37750 ^ of the air
37752 ^ nests;
37753 ^ -
37754 ^ but
37755 ^ the son
37756 ^ - of man
37758 ^ not
37759 ^ has
37760 ^ where
37761 ^ the head
37763 ^ he might lay.
37764 ^ he said
37765 ^ then
37766 ^ to another,
37768 ^ follow
37769 ^ me.
37770 ^ -
37771 ^ but
37772 ^ he said,
37773 ^ lord
37774 ^ allow
37775 ^ me
37776 ^ having gone away,
37777 ^ first,
37778 ^ to bury
37779 ^ the father of me.
37782 ^ he said
37783 ^ then
37784 ^ to him,
37785 ^ leave
37786 ^ the dead
37788 ^ to bury
37789 ^ - their own dead;
37792 ^ you
37793 ^ however,
37794 ^ having gone forth,
37795 ^ declare
37796 ^ the kingdom
37798 ^ - of god.
37800 ^ said
37801 ^ then
37802 ^ also
37803 ^ another,
37804 ^ i will follow
37805 ^ you,
37806 ^ lord;
37807 ^ first

37810 ^ me
37811 ^ to bid farewell
37812 ^ to those
37813 ^ at the home of me.
37817 ^ said
37818 ^ then
37819 ^ to him
37821 ^ - jesus,
37823 ^ no one
37824 ^ having laid
37825 ^ the hand
37827 ^ upon [the] plow,
37829 ^ and
37830 ^ looking
37831 ^ on the things behind,
37834 ^ fit
37835 ^ is
37836 ^ for the kingdom
37838 ^ - of god.
37840 ^ after
37841 ^ now
37842 ^ these things,
37843 ^ appointed
37844 ^ the lord
37846 ^ others
37847 ^ seventy two
37849 ^ and
37850 ^ sent
37851 ^ them
37852 ^ in two [by]
37854 ^ two
37855 ^ before [the] face of himself
37858 ^ into every city

37863 ^ where
37864 ^ was about
37865 ^ he himself
37866 ^ to go.
37867 ^ he was saying
37868 ^ then
37869 ^ to them,
37871 ^ the
37872 ^ indeed
37873 ^ harvest [is]
37874 ^ plentiful,
37875 ^ -
37876 ^ but
37877 ^ the workmen
37878 ^ [are] few.
37879 ^ pray earnestly to
37880 ^ therefore
37881 ^ the lord

38080 ^ for tyre
38081 ^ and sidon, more tolerable

38090 ^ and
38091 ^ you,
38092 ^ capernaum,

38134 ^ through the name of you.
38138 ^ he said
38139 ^ then
38140 ^ to them,
38141 ^ i beheld

38202 ^ - holy
38204 ^ and
38205 ^ said,
38206 ^ i fully consent

38209 ^ lord
38210 ^ of the heaven

38215 ^ that
38216 ^ you have hidden
38217 ^ these things
38218 ^ from wise
38220 ^ and intelligent,
38222 ^ and
38223 ^ have revealed
38224 ^ them
38225 ^ to little children;
38226 ^ yes,
38227 ^ - father,
38229 ^ for
38230 ^ thus
38231 ^ well-pleasing
38232 ^ was it
38233 ^ before you.
38235 ^ all things
38236 ^ to me
38237 ^ have been delivered
38238 ^ by the father of me.
38242 ^ and
38243 ^ no one
38244 ^ knows
38245 ^ who
38246 ^ is
38247 ^ the son,
38249 ^ if
38250 ^ not
38251 ^ the father;
38253 ^ and
38254 ^ who

38265 ^ might resolve
38266 ^ the son
38268 ^ to reveal [him].
38269 ^ and
38270 ^ having turned

38287 ^ that
38288 ^ many prophets
38290 ^ and kings
38292 ^ desired
38293 ^ to see
38294 ^ what
38295 ^ you
38296 ^ see,
38297 ^ and
38298 ^ not

38300 ^ and
38301 ^ to hear
38302 ^ what
38303 ^ you hear,
38304 ^ and
38305 ^ not
38306 ^ heard.
38307 ^ and
38308 ^ behold,
38309 ^ a lawyer certain
38311 ^ stood up,
38312 ^ testing
38313 ^ him,
38314 ^ saying,
38315 ^ teacher,
38316 ^ what
38317 ^ having done,
38318 ^ life eternal
38320 ^ will i inherit?
38321 ^ -
38322 ^ and
38323 ^ he said
38324 ^ to him,

38331 ^ how
38332 ^ read you?
38333 ^ -
38334 ^ and

38337 ^ you shall love
38338 ^ [the] lord
38339 ^ the god of you
38342 ^ with all the heart of you,
38347 ^ and with all the soul of you,

38371 ^ he said
38372 ^ then
38373 ^ to him,
38374 ^ correctly
38375 ^ you have answered.
38376 ^ this
38377 ^ do,
38378 ^ and
38379 ^ you will live.
38380 ^ -
38381 ^ but
38382 ^ desiring
38383 ^ to justify
38384 ^ himself,
38385 ^ he said
38386 ^ to - jesus,
38389 ^ and
38390 ^ who
38391 ^ is
38392 ^ my neighbor?
38394 ^ having taken [it] up,
38395 ^ - jesus
38397 ^ said,
38398 ^ a man certain

38414 ^ having inflicted,
38415 ^ went away,
38416 ^ having left [him]
38417 ^ half dead.
38418 ^ by chance
38420 ^ now
38421 ^ a priest certain
38423 ^ was going down
38424 ^ on the road that,
38428 ^ and
38429 ^ having seen
38430 ^ him
38431 ^ he passed by on the opposite side.
38432 ^ likewise
38433 ^ now
38434 ^ also
38435 ^ a levite
38436 ^ having come
38437 ^ to the spot,
38440 ^ having come
38441 ^ and
38442 ^ having seen [him],
38443 ^ passed by on the opposite side.
38444 ^ a samaritan
38445 ^ however,
38446 ^ one
38447 ^ journeying,
38448 ^ came
38449 ^ to him,
38451 ^ and
38452 ^ having seen
38453 ^ was moved with compassion,
38454 ^ and
38455 ^ having approached,
38456 ^ he bound up
38457 ^ the wounds of him,
38460 ^ pouring on
38461 ^ oil
38462 ^ and wine;
38464 ^ having put
38465 ^ then
38466 ^ him
38467 ^ on the own beast,
38471 ^ he brought
38472 ^ him
38473 ^ to an inn
38475 ^ and
38476 ^ took care
38477 ^ of him.
38478 ^ and
38479 ^ on the next day,
38482 ^ having taken out
38483 ^ he gave [them]
38484 ^ two denarii,
38486 ^ to the innkeeper
38488 ^ and
38489 ^ said,
38490 ^ take care
38491 ^ of him,
38492 ^ and
38493 ^ whatever
38494 ^ more
38495 ^ -
38496 ^ you might expend,
38497 ^ of me
38498 ^ on - returning,

38502 ^ will repay
38503 ^ you.
38504 ^ which
38505 ^ of these - three
38508 ^ a neighbor
38509 ^ seems
38510 ^ to you
38511 ^ to have been
38512 ^ of the [one] having fallen
38514 ^ among the robbers?
38517 ^ -
38518 ^ and
38519 ^ he said,
38520 ^ the [one] having shown
38522 ^ - compassion
38524 ^ toward him.
38526 ^ said
38527 ^ then
38528 ^ to him
38529 ^ - jesus,
38531 ^ go
38532 ^ and
38533 ^ you
38534 ^ do
38535 ^ likewise.
38536 ^ in
38537 ^ now
38538 ^ the proceeding
38540 ^ of them,
38541 ^ he
38542 ^ entered
38543 ^ into a village certain;
38546 ^ a woman
38547 ^ now
38548 ^ certain
38549 ^ named martha
38551 ^ received
38552 ^ him.
38553 ^ and
38554 ^ she
38555 ^ had
38556 ^ a sister
38557 ^ called
38558 ^ mary,
38559 ^ who
38560 ^ also
38561 ^ having sat down
38562 ^ at the feet
38565 ^ of the lord,
38567 ^ was listening to
38568 ^ the word of him.
38571 ^ -
38572 ^ but
38573 ^ martha
38574 ^ was distracted
38575 ^ about much service;
38578 ^ having come up
38579 ^ now,
38580 ^ she said,
38581 ^ lord,
38582 ^ not
38583 ^ is it concerning
38584 ^ to you
38585 ^ that
38586 ^ the sister of me
38589 ^ alone
38590 ^ me
38591 ^ has left
38592 ^ to serve?
38593 ^ speak
38594 ^ therefore
38595 ^ to her
38596 ^ that
38597 ^ me
38598 ^ she might help!
38599 ^ answering
38600 ^ now,
38601 ^ said
38602 ^ to her
38603 ^ the lord,
38605 ^ martha,
38606 ^ martha,
38607 ^ you are anxious
38608 ^ and
38609 ^ troubled
38610 ^ about many things;
38612 ^ one [thing]
38613 ^ however
38614 ^ is
38615 ^ necessary,
38616 ^ mary
38617 ^ for
38618 ^ the good portion

38622 ^ which
38623 ^ not
38624 ^ will be taken away from
38625 ^ her.
38626 ^ and
38627 ^ it came to pass
38628 ^ in - being
38631 ^ his
38632 ^ in a place certain
38635 ^ praying,
38636 ^ when
38637 ^ he ceased,
38638 ^ said
38639 ^ one
38640 ^ of the disciples of him
38643 ^ to him,
38645 ^ lord,
38646 ^ teach
38647 ^ us
38648 ^ to pray,
38649 ^ as
38650 ^ also
38651 ^ john

38683 ^ us
38684 ^ the sins of us,
38687 ^ also
38688 ^ for
38689 ^ ourselves
38690 ^ we forgive
38691 ^ everyone indebted

38694 ^ and
38695 ^ not
38696 ^ lead
38697 ^ us
38698 ^ into temptation.’”
38700 ^ and
38701 ^ he said
38702 ^ to them,
38704 ^ who
38705 ^ among you
38707 ^ will have
38708 ^ a friend,
38709 ^ and
38710 ^ will go
38711 ^ to him
38713 ^ at midnight
38714 ^ and

38716 ^ to him,
38717 ^ friend,
38718 ^ lend
38719 ^ me
38720 ^ three loaves,
38722 ^ since
38723 ^ a friend of my
38725 ^ is come
38726 ^ off a journey
38728 ^ to me,
38730 ^ and
38731 ^ nothing
38732 ^ i have
38733 ^ what
38734 ^ i will set before
38735 ^ him.
38736 ^ and he
38737 ^ from within
38738 ^ answering
38739 ^ will say,

38744 ^ already
38745 ^ the door

38759 ^ i am able
38760 ^ having risen up,
38761 ^ to give
38762 ^ to you.
38763 ^ i say
38764 ^ to you,
38765 ^ if
38766 ^ even
38767 ^ not
38768 ^ he will give
38769 ^ to him,
38770 ^ having risen up,
38771 ^ because of - being
38774 ^ friend
38775 ^ of him,
38776 ^ because of
38777 ^ yet
38778 ^ the persistence of him,
38781 ^ having risen
38782 ^ he will give
38783 ^ him
38784 ^ as much as

38786 ^ and i
38787 ^ to you

38790 ^ and
38791 ^ it will be given
38792 ^ to you;

38809 ^ and
38810 ^ to the [one] knocking,
38812 ^ it will be opened.
38813 ^ which
38814 ^ now
38815 ^ of you who [is] a father,

38823 ^ and
38824 ^ instead of a fish,
38826 ^ a serpent
38827 ^ to him
38828 ^ will he give?
38829 ^ or
38830 ^ also
38831 ^ [if] he will ask for
38832 ^ an egg,
38833 ^ will he give
38834 ^ to him
38835 ^ a scorpion?

38837 ^ therefore
38838 ^ you,
38839 ^ evil
38840 ^ being,
38841 ^ know
38842 ^ gifts good
38844 ^ to give
38845 ^ to the children of you,
38848 ^ how much more
38850 ^ the father
38852 ^ who [is]
38853 ^ in heaven
38855 ^ will give
38856 ^ [the] spirit holy
38858 ^ to those asking
38860 ^ him!
38861 ^ and
38862 ^ he was
38863 ^ casting out
38864 ^ a demon,
38865 ^ and
38866 ^ it
38867 ^ was
38868 ^ mute;
38869 ^ it came to pass
38870 ^ then
38871 ^ the
38872 ^ demon
38873 ^ having gone out,
38874 ^ spoke
38875 ^ the mute [man].
38877 ^ and
38878 ^ marveled
38879 ^ the crowds.
38881 ^ some
38882 ^ then
38883 ^ of them
38885 ^ said,
38886 ^ by beelzebul
38888 ^ the prince
38890 ^ of the demons
38892 ^ he casts out
38893 ^ the demons.
38895 ^ others
38896 ^ now,
38897 ^ testing,
38898 ^ a sign
38899 ^ from heaven
38901 ^ were seeking
38902 ^ from him.
38904 ^ he
38905 ^ now,
38906 ^ knowing
38907 ^ their - thoughts,
38910 ^ said
38911 ^ to them,
38912 ^ every kingdom
38914 ^ against itself
38916 ^ having been divided
38917 ^ is brought to desolation;
38918 ^ and
38919 ^ a house
38920 ^ against a house
38922 ^ falls.
38923 ^ if
38924 ^ now
38925 ^ also
38926 ^ - satan
38928 ^ against himself
38930 ^ is divided,
38931 ^ how
38932 ^ will stand
38933 ^ the kingdom of him?
38936 ^ for
38937 ^ you say,
38938 ^ by beelzebul
38940 ^ cast out
38941 ^ i
38942 ^ the demons.
38944 ^ if
38945 ^ now
38946 ^ i
38947 ^ by beelzebul
38949 ^ cast out
38950 ^ the demons,
38952 ^ the sons of you,
38955 ^ by whom
38957 ^ do they cast out?
38958 ^ on account of this,
38960 ^ they
38961 ^ of you judges
38963 ^ will be.
38964 ^ if
38965 ^ however
38966 ^ by [the] finger of god
38969 ^ i
38970 ^ cast out
38971 ^ the demons,
38973 ^ then
38974 ^ has come
38975 ^ upon you
38977 ^ the kingdom
38979 ^ - of god.
38981 ^ when
38982 ^ the strong [man]
38984 ^ being armed
38985 ^ might guard
38986 ^ - his house,
38989 ^ in peace
38991 ^ are
38992 ^ the possessions of him;
38995 ^ when
38996 ^ however
38997 ^ [one] stronger than he,
38999 ^ having come upon [him],
39000 ^ shall overcome
39001 ^ him,
39002 ^ the complete armor of him
39005 ^ he takes away
39006 ^ in which
39008 ^ he had trusted,
39009 ^ and
39010 ^ the plunder of him
39013 ^ he divides.
39014 ^ the [one]
39015 ^ not
39016 ^ being
39017 ^ with me
39019 ^ against me
39021 ^ is;
39022 ^ and
39023 ^ the [one]
39024 ^ not
39025 ^ gathering
39026 ^ with me
39028 ^ scatters.
39029 ^ when
39030 ^ the unclean spirit
39033 ^ is gone out
39034 ^ from the man,
39037 ^ it passes
39038 ^ through waterless places
39041 ^ seeking
39042 ^ rest;
39043 ^ and
39044 ^ not
39045 ^ finding [any],
39046 ^ then
39047 ^ it says,
39048 ^ i will return
39049 ^ to the house of me,
39053 ^ from where
39054 ^ i came out.
39055 ^ and
39056 ^ having come,
39057 ^ it finds [it]
39058 ^ swept
39059 ^ and
39060 ^ put in order.
39061 ^ then
39062 ^ it goes
39063 ^ and
39064 ^ takes
39065 ^ other spirits
39067 ^ more evil than itself, seven,
39070 ^ and
39071 ^ having entered,
39072 ^ they dwell
39073 ^ there;
39074 ^ and
39075 ^ becomes
39076 ^ the last
39078 ^ of the man that
39081 ^ worse
39082 ^ than the first.
39084 ^ it came to pass
39085 ^ then,
39086 ^ in - saying
39089 ^ his
39090 ^ these things,
39091 ^ having lifted up
39092 ^ one
39093 ^ [her] voice,
39094 ^ a woman
39095 ^ from the crowd
39098 ^ said
39099 ^ to him,
39100 ^ blessed [is]
39101 ^ the womb
39103 ^ - having borne
39105 ^ you,
39106 ^ and [the] breasts
39108 ^ at which
39109 ^ you nursed.
39110 ^ he
39111 ^ then
39112 ^ said,
39113 ^ no rather,
39114 ^ blessed [are]
39115 ^ those hearing
39117 ^ the word
39119 ^ - of god
39121 ^ and
39122 ^ keeping it.
39123 ^ of the
39124 ^ now
39125 ^ crowds
39126 ^ being pressed around together,
39127 ^ he began
39128 ^ to say,
39129 ^ the generation this,
39132 ^ generation an evil
39134 ^ is;
39135 ^ a sign
39136 ^ it seeks after,
39137 ^ and
39138 ^ a sign
39139 ^ not
39140 ^ will be given
39141 ^ to it,
39142 ^ if
39143 ^ not
39144 ^ the sign of jonah.
39147 ^ as
39148 ^ for
39149 ^ was
39150 ^ jonah
39151 ^ to the ninevites a sign,
39154 ^ thus
39155 ^ will be
39156 ^ also
39157 ^ the son
39159 ^ - of man
39161 ^ to the generation this.
39164 ^ the queen of [the] south
39166 ^ will rise up
39167 ^ in the judgment
39170 ^ with the men
39173 ^ of the generation this,
39176 ^ and
39177 ^ will condemn
39178 ^ them.
39179 ^ for
39180 ^ she came
39181 ^ from the ends
39184 ^ of the earth
39186 ^ to hear
39187 ^ the wisdom of solomon,
39190 ^ and
39191 ^ behold,
39192 ^ greater than solomon
39194 ^ here.
39195 ^ [the] men of nineveh
39197 ^ will stand up
39198 ^ in the judgment
39201 ^ with the generation this,
39205 ^ and
39206 ^ will condemn
39207 ^ it.
39208 ^ for
39209 ^ they repented
39210 ^ at the preaching of jonah,
39214 ^ and
39215 ^ behold,
39216 ^ greater than jonah
39218 ^ [is] here.
39219 ^ but no one
39220 ^ a lamp
39221 ^ having lit,
39222 ^ in secret
39224 ^ sets it,
39225 ^ nor
39226 ^ under the basket,
39229 ^ but
39230 ^ upon the lampstand,
39233 ^ that
39234 ^ those entering in
39236 ^ the light
39238 ^ may see.
39239 ^ the lamp
39241 ^ of your body
39243 ^ is
39244 ^ the eye of you.
39247 ^ when
39248 ^ the eye of you
39251 ^ clear
39252 ^ is,
39253 ^ also
39254 ^ all the body of you
39258 ^ light
39259 ^ is;
39260 ^ when
39261 ^ however
39262 ^ evil
39263 ^ it be,
39264 ^ also
39265 ^ the body of you
39268 ^ [is] dark.
39269 ^ take heed
39270 ^ therefore,
39271 ^ lest
39272 ^ the light
39274 ^ that [is]
39275 ^ in you
39277 ^ darkness
39278 ^ be.
39279 ^ if
39280 ^ therefore
39281 ^ the body of you
39284 ^ [is] full of light,
39286 ^ not
39287 ^ having
39288 ^ part
39289 ^ any dark,
39291 ^ it will be
39292 ^ light all,
39294 ^ as
39295 ^ when
39296 ^ the lamp
39298 ^ - shining
39300 ^ might light
39301 ^ you.
39302 ^ in
39303 ^ then
39304 ^ the speaking,
39306 ^ asked
39307 ^ him
39308 ^ a pharisee
39309 ^ that
39310 ^ he would dine
39311 ^ with him,
39313 ^ having entered
39314 ^ then,
39315 ^ he reclined.
39316 ^ -
39317 ^ and
39318 ^ the pharisee,
39319 ^ having seen [it],
39320 ^ marveled
39321 ^ that
39322 ^ not
39323 ^ first
39324 ^ he washed
39325 ^ before the dinner.
39328 ^ said
39329 ^ then

39673 ^ to you,
39674 ^ those friends of me,

39685 ^ after these things
39687 ^ not
39688 ^ being able
39689 ^ more abundantly anything
39691 ^ to do.
39692 ^ i will show
39693 ^ however
39694 ^ you
39695 ^ whom
39696 ^ you should fear:
39697 ^ fear
39698 ^ the [one who]
39699 ^ after the killing,
39702 ^ has
39703 ^ authority
39704 ^ to cast
39705 ^ into - hell.
39708 ^ yes,
39709 ^ i say
39710 ^ to you,
39711 ^ him
39712 ^ fear.
39713 ^ not
39714 ^ five sparrows
39716 ^ are sold for
39717 ^ assarion two?
39719 ^ and
39720 ^ one
39721 ^ of them
39723 ^ not
39724 ^ is
39725 ^ forgotten
39726 ^ before - god.
39729 ^ but
39730 ^ even
39731 ^ the hairs
39733 ^ of the head of you all
39737 ^ have been numbered.
39738 ^ not
39739 ^ fear,
39740 ^ than many sparrows
39742 ^ you are more valuable.
39743 ^ i say
39744 ^ now
39745 ^ to you,
39746 ^ everyone who
39748 ^ -
39749 ^ will confess
39750 ^ in me
39752 ^ before the men,
39755 ^ also
39756 ^ the son
39758 ^ - of man
39760 ^ will confess
39761 ^ in him
39763 ^ before the angels
39766 ^ - of god;
39768 ^ the [one]
39769 ^ now
39770 ^ having denied
39771 ^ me
39772 ^ before - men,
39775 ^ will be denied
39776 ^ before the angels
39779 ^ - of god.
39781 ^ and
39782 ^ everyone who
39784 ^ will speak
39785 ^ a word
39786 ^ against the son
39789 ^ - of man,
39791 ^ it will be forgiven
39792 ^ him;
39793 ^ the [one]
39794 ^ however
39795 ^ against
39796 ^ the holy spirit
39799 ^ having blasphemed,
39800 ^ not
39801 ^ will be forgiven.
39802 ^ when
39803 ^ then
39804 ^ they bring
39805 ^ you
39806 ^ before the synagogues,
39809 ^ and the rulers,
39812 ^ and the authorities,
39815 ^ not
39816 ^ be anxious
39817 ^ how
39818 ^ or
39819 ^ what
39820 ^ you shall reply in defense,
39821 ^ or
39822 ^ what
39823 ^ you should say;
39824 ^ the
39825 ^ for
39826 ^ holy spirit
39828 ^ will teach
39829 ^ you
39830 ^ in same the hour
39834 ^ what
39835 ^ it behooves [you]
39836 ^ to say.
39837 ^ said
39838 ^ then
39839 ^ one
39840 ^ from the crowd
39843 ^ to him,
39844 ^ teacher,
39845 ^ say
39846 ^ to the brother of me
39849 ^ to divide
39850 ^ with me
39852 ^ the inheritance.
39854 ^ -
39855 ^ and
39856 ^ he said
39857 ^ to him,
39858 ^ man,
39859 ^ who
39860 ^ me
39861 ^ appointed
39862 ^ a judge
39863 ^ or partitioner
39865 ^ over you?
39867 ^ he said
39868 ^ then
39869 ^ to them,
39871 ^ beware
39872 ^ and
39873 ^ keep yourselves
39874 ^ from all covetousness;
39877 ^ for
39878 ^ not
39879 ^ in the abundance
39882 ^ to anyone,
39883 ^ the life to him
39886 ^ is
39887 ^ of that which possesses of him.
39891 ^ he spoke
39892 ^ then
39893 ^ a parable
39894 ^ to them,
39896 ^ saying,
39897 ^ of a man
39898 ^ certain rich
39900 ^ brought forth abundantly
39901 ^ the ground.
39903 ^ and
39904 ^ he was reasoning
39905 ^ within himself,
39907 ^ saying,
39908 ^ what
39909 ^ shall i do,
39910 ^ for
39911 ^ not
39912 ^ i have
39913 ^ where
39914 ^ i will store up
39915 ^ the fruits of me?
39918 ^ and
39919 ^ he said,
39920 ^ this
39921 ^ will i do:
39922 ^ i will tear down
39923 ^ my - barns
39926 ^ and
39927 ^ greater
39928 ^ will build,
39929 ^ and
39930 ^ will store up
39931 ^ there
39932 ^ all the grain
39935 ^ and the goods of me.
39939 ^ and
39940 ^ i will say
39941 ^ to the soul of me,
39944 ^ soul,
39945 ^ you have
39946 ^ many good things
39948 ^ laid up
39949 ^ for years many;
39952 ^ take your rest;
39953 ^ eat,
39954 ^ drink,
39955 ^ be merry.
39956 ^ said
39957 ^ then
39958 ^ to him
39959 ^ - god,
39961 ^ fool!
39962 ^ this - night,
39965 ^ the soul of you
39968 ^ is required
39969 ^ of you;
39971 ^ what
39972 ^ now
39973 ^ you did prepare —
39974 ^ to whom
39975 ^ will [it] be?
39976 ^ so [is]
39977 ^ the [one] treasuring up
39979 ^ for himself,
39980 ^ and
39981 ^ not
39982 ^ toward god
39984 ^ being rich.
39985 ^ he said
39986 ^ then
39987 ^ to the disciples of him,
39991 ^ because of this
39993 ^ i say
39994 ^ to you,
39995 ^ not
39996 ^ be anxious
39997 ^ for the life,
39999 ^ what
40000 ^ you should eat,
40001 ^ nor
40002 ^ for the body
40004 ^ what
40005 ^ you should put on.
40006 ^ the
40007 ^ for
40008 ^ life
40009 ^ more than
40010 ^ is
40011 ^ the food,
40013 ^ and
40014 ^ the body
40016 ^ than the clothing.
40018 ^ consider
40019 ^ the ravens,
40021 ^ that
40022 ^ not
40023 ^ they sow
40024 ^ nor
40025 ^ reap;
40026 ^ to them
40027 ^ not
40028 ^ there is
40029 ^ a storehouse
40030 ^ nor
40031 ^ barn —
40032 ^ and
40033 ^ - god
40035 ^ feeds
40036 ^ them.
40037 ^ how much more
40039 ^ you
40040 ^ are valuable
40041 ^ than the birds!
40043 ^ which
40044 ^ now
40045 ^ of you,
40047 ^ being anxious,
40048 ^ is able
40049 ^ to the lifespan of him
40053 ^ to add
40054 ^ one hour?
40055 ^ if
40056 ^ then
40057 ^ not even
40058 ^ [the] least
40059 ^ you are able [to do],
40060 ^ why
40061 ^ about the rest
40064 ^ are you anxious?
40065 ^ consider
40066 ^ the lilies,
40068 ^ how
40069 ^ they grow:
40070 ^ not
40071 ^ do they labor,
40072 ^ nor
40073 ^ do they spin.
40074 ^ i say
40075 ^ however
40076 ^ to you,
40077 ^ not even
40078 ^ solomon
40079 ^ in all the glory of him
40084 ^ was arrayed
40085 ^ as
40086 ^ one of these.
40088 ^ if
40089 ^ however
40090 ^ in [the] field the grass,
40094 ^ being [here]
40095 ^ today
40096 ^ and
40097 ^ tomorrow
40098 ^ into the furnace
40100 ^ being thrown,
40101 ^ - god
40103 ^ thus
40104 ^ clothes,
40105 ^ how much more
40107 ^ you,
40108 ^ o [you] of little faith!
40109 ^ and
40110 ^ you
40111 ^ not
40112 ^ seek
40113 ^ what
40114 ^ you might eat,
40115 ^ and
40116 ^ what
40117 ^ you might drink,
40118 ^ and
40119 ^ not
40120 ^ be in suspense;
40121 ^ these things
40122 ^ for
40123 ^ all
40124 ^ the nations
40126 ^ of the world
40128 ^ seek after;
40129 ^ of you
40130 ^ now
40131 ^ the father
40133 ^ knows
40134 ^ that
40135 ^ you have need
40136 ^ of these.
40137 ^ but
40138 ^ seek you
40139 ^ the kingdom of him,
40142 ^ and
40143 ^ these things
40144 ^ will be added
40145 ^ to you.
40146 ^ not
40147 ^ fear,
40148 ^ - little flock,
40151 ^ for
40152 ^ took delight
40153 ^ the father of you
40156 ^ to give

40158 ^ the kingdom.
40160 ^ sell
40161 ^ the possessions of you

40796 ^ also
40797 ^ this the year,

40872 ^ - god.
40874 ^ answering
40875 ^ now
40876 ^ the ruler of the synagogue,
40878 ^ indignant

40998 ^ having taken,
40999 ^ a man
41000 ^ cast
41001 ^ into garden his;
41004 ^ and
41005 ^ it grew
41006 ^ and

41008 ^ into a tree,
41010 ^ and
41011 ^ the birds
41013 ^ of the air
41015 ^ encamped
41016 ^ in the branches of it.
41020 ^ and
41021 ^ again

41089 ^ the master of the house,
41091 ^ and
41092 ^ shall have shut
41093 ^ the door,
41095 ^ then
41096 ^ you should begin
41097 ^ outside
41098 ^ to stand
41099 ^ and
41100 ^ to knock
41101 ^ at the door,
41103 ^ saying,
41104 ^ lord,
41105 ^ open
41106 ^ to us.
41107 ^ and
41108 ^ he answering,
41109 ^ will say

41119 ^ we ate
41120 ^ in presence of you
41122 ^ and
41123 ^ drank,
41124 ^ and
41125 ^ in the streets of us
41129 ^ you taught.
41130 ^ and
41131 ^ he will say,

41176 ^ from east
41178 ^ and west,
41180 ^ and from north
41183 ^ and south,
41185 ^ and
41186 ^ will recline
41187 ^ in the kingdom
41190 ^ - of god.
41192 ^ and
41193 ^ behold,
41194 ^ there are
41195 ^ last

41322 ^ of one
41323 ^ of the rulers

41337 ^ a man
41338 ^ certain
41339 ^ there was
41340 ^ with dropsy
41341 ^ before him.
41343 ^ and
41344 ^ answering,
41345 ^ - jesus
41347 ^ spoke
41348 ^ to the lawyers
41351 ^ and to [the] pharisees,
41353 ^ saying,
41354 ^ is it lawful
41355 ^ on the sabbath
41357 ^ to heal
41358 ^ or

41360 ^ -
41361 ^ but

41369 ^ and
41370 ^ to them
41372 ^ he said,
41373 ^ which of you a son

41378 ^ into a pit
41380 ^ will fall,
41381 ^ also

41386 ^ on day
41388 ^ the sabbath?
41390 ^ and
41391 ^ not
41392 ^ they were able
41393 ^ to reply
41394 ^ to these things.
41396 ^ he was speaking
41397 ^ then
41398 ^ to those having been invited
41401 ^ a parable,
41402 ^ remarking
41403 ^ how
41404 ^ the first places
41406 ^ they were choosing out,
41407 ^ saying
41408 ^ to them,
41410 ^ when
41411 ^ you are invited
41412 ^ by anyone
41414 ^ to wedding feasts,
41416 ^ not
41417 ^ do recline
41418 ^ in the first place,
41421 ^ lest ever
41422 ^ [one] more honorable than you
41424 ^ might have been
41425 ^ invited
41426 ^ by him,
41428 ^ and
41429 ^ having come,
41430 ^ the [one]
41431 ^ you
41432 ^ and him
41434 ^ having invited
41435 ^ will say
41436 ^ to you,
41437 ^ give
41438 ^ to this one
41439 ^ [your] place,
41440 ^ and
41441 ^ then
41442 ^ you should begin
41443 ^ with shame
41445 ^ the last place
41448 ^ to take.
41449 ^ but
41450 ^ when
41451 ^ you are invited,
41452 ^ having gone,
41453 ^ recline
41454 ^ in the last place,
41458 ^ so that
41459 ^ when
41460 ^ might come
41461 ^ the [one] having invited
41463 ^ you,
41464 ^ he will say
41465 ^ to you,
41466 ^ friend,
41467 ^ come up
41468 ^ higher.
41469 ^ then
41470 ^ will be
41471 ^ to you
41472 ^ glory
41473 ^ before all those reclining
41477 ^ [with] you.
41478 ^ for
41479 ^ everyone - exalting
41482 ^ himself
41483 ^ will be humbled,
41484 ^ and
41485 ^ the [one] humbling
41487 ^ himself
41488 ^ will be exalted.
41489 ^ he was saying
41490 ^ then
41491 ^ also
41492 ^ to the [one] having invited
41494 ^ him,
41495 ^ when
41496 ^ you make
41497 ^ a dinner
41498 ^ or a supper,
41500 ^ not
41501 ^ call
41502 ^ - friends of you,
41505 ^ nor the brothers of you,
41509 ^ nor the relatives of you,
41513 ^ nor neighbors rich,
41516 ^ lest ever
41517 ^ also
41518 ^ they
41519 ^ should invite in return
41520 ^ you,
41521 ^ and
41522 ^ be made
41523 ^ recompense
41524 ^ to you.
41525 ^ but
41526 ^ when
41527 ^ a feast
41528 ^ you make,
41529 ^ call
41530 ^ the poor,
41531 ^ the crippled,
41532 ^ the lame,
41533 ^ the blind;
41534 ^ and
41535 ^ blessed
41536 ^ you will be,
41537 ^ because
41538 ^ nothing
41539 ^ they have
41540 ^ to repay
41541 ^ you.
41542 ^ it will be recompensed
41543 ^ for
41544 ^ to you
41545 ^ in the resurrection
41548 ^ of the righteous.
41550 ^ having heard
41551 ^ then
41552 ^ one
41553 ^ of those reclining with [him]
41555 ^ these things,
41556 ^ he said
41557 ^ to him,
41558 ^ blessed [is he]
41559 ^ who
41560 ^ will eat
41561 ^ bread
41562 ^ in the kingdom
41565 ^ - of god.
41567 ^ -
41568 ^ but
41569 ^ he said
41570 ^ to him,
41571 ^ a man certain
41573 ^ was preparing
41574 ^ a supper great,
41576 ^ and
41577 ^ invited
41578 ^ many.
41579 ^ and
41580 ^ he sent
41581 ^ the servant of him
41584 ^ at the hour
41586 ^ of the supper
41588 ^ to say
41589 ^ to those having been invited,
41591 ^ come,
41592 ^ for
41593 ^ now
41594 ^ ready
41595 ^ [it] is.
41596 ^ and
41597 ^ began
41598 ^ with one [voice]
41600 ^ all
41601 ^ to excuse themselves.
41602 ^ the first
41604 ^ said
41605 ^ to him,
41606 ^ a field
41607 ^ i have bought,
41608 ^ and
41609 ^ i have
41610 ^ need
41611 ^ going out
41612 ^ to see
41613 ^ it;
41614 ^ i beg of
41615 ^ you,
41616 ^ hold
41617 ^ me
41618 ^ excused.
41619 ^ and
41620 ^ another
41621 ^ said,
41622 ^ yoke of oxen
41624 ^ i have bought
41625 ^ five,
41626 ^ and
41627 ^ i am going
41628 ^ to prove
41629 ^ them;
41630 ^ i beg of
41631 ^ you
41632 ^ hold
41633 ^ me
41634 ^ excused.
41635 ^ and
41636 ^ another
41637 ^ said,
41638 ^ a wife
41639 ^ i have married,
41640 ^ and
41641 ^ because of this
41643 ^ not
41644 ^ i am able
41645 ^ to come.
41646 ^ and
41647 ^ having come,
41648 ^ the servant
41650 ^ reported
41651 ^ to the master of him
41654 ^ these things.
41655 ^ then
41656 ^ having become angry,
41657 ^ the master of the house
41659 ^ said
41660 ^ to servant of him,
41663 ^ go out
41664 ^ quickly
41665 ^ into the streets
41668 ^ and lanes
41670 ^ of the city,
41672 ^ and
41673 ^ the poor
41675 ^ and crippled
41677 ^ and blind
41679 ^ and lame
41681 ^ bring in
41682 ^ here.
41683 ^ and
41684 ^ said
41685 ^ the servant,
41687 ^ sir,
41688 ^ it has been done
41689 ^ as
41690 ^ you did command,
41691 ^ and
41692 ^ still

41694 ^ there is.
41695 ^ and

41703 ^ into the highways
41706 ^ and hedges

41711 ^ so that
41712 ^ may be filled
41713 ^ of me the house.
41716 ^ i say
41717 ^ for
41718 ^ to you
41719 ^ that
41720 ^ not one
41721 ^ the men

41727 ^ of me the supper.
41730 ^ were going with
41731 ^ then
41732 ^ him
41733 ^ crowds great;
41735 ^ and
41736 ^ having turned,
41737 ^ he said
41738 ^ to them,
41740 ^ if
41741 ^ anyone
41742 ^ comes
41743 ^ to me,
41745 ^ and

41957 ^ what man
41959 ^ of you,

41962 ^ a hundred sheep,
41964 ^ and
41965 ^ having lost
41966 ^ of them one,
41969 ^ not

41971 ^ the
41972 ^ ninety nine
41974 ^ in the open field,
41977 ^ and
41978 ^ goes
41979 ^ after the [one] having been lost,
41982 ^ until
41983 ^ he finds
41984 ^ it?
41985 ^ and
41986 ^ having found [it],
41987 ^ he lays [it]
41988 ^ on the shoulders of him,
41992 ^ rejoicing.
41993 ^ and
41994 ^ having come
41995 ^ to the house,
41998 ^ he calls together
41999 ^ the friends
42001 ^ and the neighbors,
42004 ^ saying
42005 ^ to them,
42006 ^ rejoice with

42008 ^ for
42009 ^ i have found
42010 ^ the sheep of me,
42013 ^ the [one] having been lost!
42015 ^ i say
42016 ^ to you
42017 ^ that
42018 ^ in the same way

42020 ^ in - heaven
42023 ^ there will be
42024 ^ over one sinner
42027 ^ repenting,
42028 ^ rather than over ninety nine righteous ones,
42033 ^ who
42034 ^ no
42035 ^ need
42036 ^ have
42037 ^ of repentance.
42038 ^ or
42039 ^ what woman,

42051 ^ and
42052 ^ sweeps
42053 ^ the house,
42055 ^ and

42057 ^ carefully
42058 ^ until it

42061 ^ and
42062 ^ having found [it],
42063 ^ she calls together
42064 ^ the friends

42072 ^ i have found
42073 ^ the drachma
42075 ^ that
42076 ^ i lost.
42077 ^ thus
42078 ^ i say
42079 ^ to you,
42080 ^ there is
42081 ^ joy
42082 ^ before the angels
42085 ^ - of god
42087 ^ over one sinner
42090 ^ repenting.
42091 ^ he said
42092 ^ then,
42093 ^ a man certain
42095 ^ had
42096 ^ two sons.
42098 ^ and
42099 ^ said
42100 ^ the younger
42102 ^ of them to [the] father,
42105 ^ father,
42106 ^ give
42107 ^ to me
42108 ^ the
42109 ^ falling [to me] portion
42111 ^ of the property.
42113 ^ -
42114 ^ and
42115 ^ he divided
42116 ^ between them
42117 ^ the property.
42119 ^ and
42120 ^ after
42121 ^ not many days,
42124 ^ having gathered together
42125 ^ all,
42126 ^ the younger son
42129 ^ went away
42130 ^ into a country distant,
42133 ^ and
42134 ^ there
42135 ^ he wasted
42136 ^ the estate of him,
42139 ^ living
42140 ^ prodigally.
42141 ^ having spent
42142 ^ however
42143 ^ of him
42144 ^ all,
42145 ^ there arose
42146 ^ a famine severe
42148 ^ throughout the country that,
42152 ^ and
42153 ^ he
42154 ^ began
42155 ^ to be in need.
42156 ^ and
42157 ^ having gone,
42158 ^ he joined himself
42159 ^ to one
42160 ^ of the citizens
42162 ^ the country of that,
42165 ^ and
42166 ^ he sent
42167 ^ him
42168 ^ into the fields of him
42172 ^ to feed
42173 ^ pigs.
42174 ^ and
42175 ^ he was longing
42176 ^ to be filled
42177 ^ from the pods
42180 ^ that
42181 ^ were eating
42182 ^ the pigs;
42184 ^ and
42185 ^ no one
42186 ^ was giving
42187 ^ to him.
42188 ^ to himself
42190 ^ however
42191 ^ having come,
42192 ^ he was saying,
42193 ^ how many hired servants
42195 ^ of the father of me
42198 ^ have abundance
42199 ^ of bread,
42200 ^ i
42201 ^ however
42202 ^ with hunger
42203 ^ here
42204 ^ am perishing?
42205 ^ having risen up,
42206 ^ i will go
42207 ^ to the father of me,
42211 ^ and
42212 ^ i will say
42213 ^ to him,
42214 ^ father,
42215 ^ i have sinned
42216 ^ against - heaven
42219 ^ and before you;
42222 ^ no longer
42223 ^ am i
42224 ^ worthy
42225 ^ to be called
42226 ^ son of you.
42228 ^ make
42229 ^ me
42230 ^ like one
42232 ^ of the servants of you.
42235 ^ and
42236 ^ having risen up,
42237 ^ he went
42238 ^ to the father of himself.
42242 ^ still
42243 ^ now
42244 ^ he
42245 ^ far
42246 ^ being distant,
42247 ^ saw
42248 ^ him
42249 ^ the father of him,
42252 ^ and
42253 ^ was moved with compassion,
42254 ^ and
42255 ^ having run,
42256 ^ fell
42257 ^ upon the neck of him
42261 ^ and
42262 ^ kissed
42263 ^ him.
42264 ^ said
42265 ^ then
42266 ^ the son
42268 ^ to him,
42269 ^ father,
42270 ^ i have sinned
42271 ^ against - heaven
42274 ^ and before you;
42277 ^ no longer
42278 ^ am i
42279 ^ worthy
42280 ^ to be called
42281 ^ son of you.
42283 ^ said
42284 ^ then
42285 ^ the father
42287 ^ to the servants of him,
42291 ^ quickly
42292 ^ bring out
42293 ^ robe
42294 ^ the best
42296 ^ and
42297 ^ clothe
42298 ^ him,
42299 ^ and
42300 ^ give
42301 ^ a ring
42302 ^ for the hand of him,
42306 ^ and
42307 ^ sandals
42308 ^ for his feet;
42311 ^ and
42312 ^ having brought
42313 ^ the calf
42315 ^ - fattened,
42317 ^ kill [it],
42318 ^ and
42319 ^ having eaten,
42320 ^ let us be merry.
42321 ^ for
42322 ^ this - son of mine
42326 ^ dead
42327 ^ was,
42328 ^ and
42329 ^ is alive again;
42330 ^ he was
42331 ^ lost,
42332 ^ and
42333 ^ is found.
42334 ^ and
42335 ^ they began
42336 ^ to be merry.
42337 ^ was
42338 ^ now
42339 ^ the son of him,
42342 ^ the elder,
42344 ^ in [the] field;
42346 ^ and
42347 ^ while
42348 ^ coming [up],
42349 ^ he drew near
42350 ^ to the house,
42352 ^ he heard
42353 ^ music
42354 ^ and dancing.
42356 ^ and
42357 ^ having called near
42358 ^ one
42359 ^ of the servants,
42361 ^ he began inquiring
42362 ^ what
42363 ^ -
42364 ^ might be
42365 ^ these things.
42366 ^ -
42367 ^ and
42368 ^ he said
42369 ^ to him
42370 ^ -,
42371 ^ the brother of you
42374 ^ is come,
42375 ^ and
42376 ^ has killed
42377 ^ the father of you
42380 ^ the calf
42382 ^ - fattened,
42384 ^ because
42385 ^ in good health him
42387 ^ he has received.
42388 ^ he was angry
42389 ^ however,
42390 ^ and
42391 ^ not
42392 ^ was willing
42393 ^ to go in.
42394 ^ -
42395 ^ and
42396 ^ the father of him,
42398 ^ having gone,
42399 ^ was begging
42400 ^ him.
42401 ^ -
42402 ^ and
42403 ^ answering,
42404 ^ he said
42405 ^ to [the] father of him,
42408 ^ behold,
42409 ^ so many years
42411 ^ i serve
42412 ^ you,
42413 ^ and
42414 ^ never
42415 ^ a commandment of you
42417 ^ i disobeyed,
42418 ^ and
42419 ^ to me
42420 ^ never
42421 ^ did you give
42422 ^ a young goat,
42423 ^ that
42424 ^ with the friends of me
42428 ^ i might make merry.
42429 ^ when
42430 ^ however
42431 ^ the son of you
42434 ^ this,
42435 ^ the [one] having devoured
42437 ^ your - living
42440 ^ with prostitutes,
42442 ^ came,
42443 ^ you have killed
42444 ^ for him
42445 ^ the fattened calf!
42448 ^ -
42449 ^ and
42450 ^ he said
42451 ^ to him,
42452 ^ son,
42453 ^ you
42454 ^ always
42455 ^ with me
42457 ^ are,
42458 ^ and
42459 ^ all that [is] mine,
42462 ^ yours
42463 ^ is.
42464 ^ to make merry
42465 ^ however
42466 ^ and
42467 ^ to rejoice
42468 ^ it was fitting,
42469 ^ because
42470 ^ the brother of you this,
42474 ^ dead
42475 ^ was,
42476 ^ and
42477 ^ is alive again;
42478 ^ and
42479 ^ he was lost,
42480 ^ and
42481 ^ is found.
42482 ^ he was saying
42483 ^ now
42484 ^ also
42485 ^ to the disciples,
42488 ^ a man certain
42490 ^ there was
42491 ^ rich,
42492 ^ who
42493 ^ had
42494 ^ a manager,
42495 ^ and
42496 ^ he
42497 ^ was accused
42498 ^ unto him
42499 ^ as
42500 ^ is wasting
42501 ^ the possessions of him.
42504 ^ and
42505 ^ having called
42506 ^ him,
42507 ^ he said
42508 ^ to him,
42509 ^ what [is]
42510 ^ this
42511 ^ i hear
42512 ^ concerning you?
42514 ^ give
42515 ^ the account
42517 ^ of the stewardship of you;
42520 ^ not
42521 ^ for
42522 ^ you are able
42523 ^ any longer
42524 ^ to manage.
42525 ^ said
42526 ^ then
42527 ^ within himself
42529 ^ the manager,
42531 ^ what
42532 ^ shall i do,
42533 ^ for
42534 ^ the master of me
42537 ^ is taking away
42538 ^ the management
42540 ^ from me?
42542 ^ to dig
42543 ^ not
42544 ^ i am able;
42545 ^ to beg
42546 ^ i am ashamed.
42547 ^ i know
42548 ^ what
42549 ^ i will do
42550 ^ so that
42551 ^ when
42552 ^ i shall have been removed
42553 ^ from the management,
42556 ^ they might receive
42557 ^ me
42558 ^ into the homes of them.
42562 ^ and
42563 ^ having called to [him]
42564 ^ one each
42566 ^ of the debtors
42568 ^ of the master of him,
42571 ^ he was saying
42572 ^ to the first,
42574 ^ how much
42575 ^ owe you
42576 ^ to master of me?
42579 ^ -
42580 ^ and
42581 ^ he said,
42582 ^ a hundred baths of oil.
42585 ^ -
42586 ^ and
42587 ^ he said
42588 ^ to him,
42589 ^ take
42590 ^ your the bill
42593 ^ and,
42594 ^ having sat down
42595 ^ quickly,
42596 ^ write
42597 ^ fifty.
42598 ^ then
42599 ^ to another
42600 ^ he said,
42601 ^ you
42602 ^ now
42603 ^ how much
42604 ^ owe?
42605 ^ -
42606 ^ and
42607 ^ he said,
42608 ^ a hundred cors of wheat.
42611 ^ he says
42612 ^ to him,
42613 ^ take
42614 ^ your - bill
42617 ^ and
42618 ^ write
42619 ^ eighty.
42620 ^ and
42621 ^ praised
42622 ^ the master
42624 ^ the manager
42626 ^ - unrighteous,
42628 ^ because
42629 ^ shrewdly
42630 ^ he had acted.
42631 ^ for
42632 ^ the sons
42634 ^ of the age this
42637 ^ more shrewd
42638 ^ than the sons
42641 ^ of the light
42643 ^ in the generation
42646 ^ - of themselves
42648 ^ are.
42649 ^ and
42650 ^ i
42651 ^ to you
42652 ^ say,
42653 ^ for yourselves
42654 ^ make
42655 ^ friends
42656 ^ by the wealth
42659 ^ - of unrighteousness,
42661 ^ that
42662 ^ when
42663 ^ it fails
42664 ^ they might receive
42665 ^ you
42666 ^ into the eternal dwellings.
42670 ^ the [one] faithful
42672 ^ with very little,
42674 ^ also
42675 ^ with much
42677 ^ faithful
42678 ^ is;
42679 ^ and
42680 ^ the [one]
42681 ^ with very little unrighteous,
42684 ^ also
42685 ^ with much
42687 ^ unrighteous
42688 ^ is.
42689 ^ if
42690 ^ therefore
42691 ^ in the unrighteous wealth,
42695 ^ faithful
42696 ^ not
42697 ^ you have been,
42698 ^ the true [riches]
42700 ^ who
42701 ^ to you
42702 ^ will entrust?
42703 ^ and
42704 ^ if
42705 ^ in that which [is] of another,
42708 ^ faithful
42709 ^ not
42710 ^ you have been,
42711 ^ that which [is] yours
42713 ^ who
42714 ^ to you?
42715 ^ will give
42716 ^ no servant
42718 ^ is able
42719 ^ two masters
42721 ^ to serve;
42722 ^ either
42723 ^ for
42724 ^ the one
42726 ^ he will hate,
42727 ^ and
42728 ^ the other
42730 ^ he will love;
42731 ^ or
42732 ^ one
42733 ^ he will be devoted to,
42734 ^ and
42735 ^ the other
42737 ^ he will despise.
42738 ^ not
42739 ^ you are able
42740 ^ god
42741 ^ to serve
42742 ^ and money.
42744 ^ were listening to
42745 ^ now
42746 ^ these things all
42748 ^ the pharisees,
42750 ^ lovers of money
42751 ^ being,
42752 ^ and
42753 ^ they were ridiculing
42754 ^ him.
42755 ^ and
42756 ^ he said
42757 ^ to them,
42758 ^ you
42759 ^ are
42760 ^ those justifying
42762 ^ themselves
42763 ^ before - men,
42766 ^ -
42767 ^ but
42768 ^ god
42769 ^ knows
42770 ^ the hearts of you;
42773 ^ for
42774 ^ that which
42775 ^ among men [is] exalted
42778 ^ [is] an abomination
42779 ^ before - god.
42782 ^ the law
42784 ^ and the prophets [were]
42787 ^ until john;
42789 ^ from that time
42791 ^ the kingdom
42793 ^ - of god
42795 ^ is proclaimed,
42796 ^ and
42797 ^ everyone
42798 ^ into it
42800 ^ forces his way.
42801 ^ easier for
42802 ^ however
42803 ^ it is
42804 ^ the heaven
42806 ^ and the earth
42809 ^ to pass away,
42810 ^ than
42811 ^ of the law one stroke of a pen
42815 ^ to fail.
42816 ^ everyone
42817 ^ - putting away
42819 ^ the wife of him

42833 ^ a man
42834 ^ now
42835 ^ certain
42836 ^ there was
42837 ^ rich,
42838 ^ and
42839 ^ he was clothed in
42840 ^ purple
42841 ^ and fine linen,
42843 ^ making good cheer
42844 ^ every day
42846 ^ in splendor.
42847 ^ a poor man
42848 ^ now
42849 ^ certain
42850 ^ named lazarus
42852 ^ was laid
42853 ^ at the gate of him,
42857 ^ being full of sores
42858 ^ and
42859 ^ desiring
42860 ^ to be fed
42861 ^ from that falling
42864 ^ from the table
42867 ^ of the rich man;
42869 ^ but
42870 ^ even
42871 ^ the dogs,
42873 ^ coming,
42874 ^ were licking
42875 ^ the sores of him.
42878 ^ it came to pass that
42879 ^ then
42880 ^ died
42881 ^ the poor man,
42883 ^ and
42884 ^ was carried away
42885 ^ he
42886 ^ by the angels
42889 ^ into the bosom of abraham.
42893 ^ died
42894 ^ then
42895 ^ also
42896 ^ the rich man
42898 ^ and
42899 ^ was buried.
42900 ^ and
42901 ^ in - hades,
42904 ^ having lifted up
42905 ^ the eyes of him,
42908 ^ being
42909 ^ in torment,
42911 ^ he sees
42912 ^ abraham
42913 ^ from afar,
42915 ^ and lazarus
42917 ^ in the bosom of him.
42921 ^ and
42922 ^ he
42923 ^ having cried out
42924 ^ said,
42925 ^ father
42926 ^ abraham,
42927 ^ have mercy on
42928 ^ me
42929 ^ and
42930 ^ send
42931 ^ lazarus,
42932 ^ that
42933 ^ he might dip
42934 ^ the tip
42936 ^ of the finger of him
42939 ^ in water
42940 ^ and
42941 ^ cool
42942 ^ the tongue of me;
42945 ^ for
42946 ^ i am suffering
42947 ^ in the flame this.
42951 ^ said
42952 ^ then
42953 ^ abraham,
42954 ^ child,
42955 ^ remember
42956 ^ that
42957 ^ you did fully receive
42958 ^ the [things] good of you
42961 ^ in the lifetime of you,
42965 ^ and
42966 ^ lazarus
42967 ^ likewise
42968 ^ the [things] evil.
42970 ^ now
42971 ^ however
42972 ^ here
42973 ^ he is comforted;
42974 ^ you
42975 ^ now
42976 ^ are suffering.
42977 ^ and
42978 ^ besides all these things,
42981 ^ between us
42983 ^ and you
42985 ^ a chasm great
42987 ^ has been fixed,
42988 ^ so that
42989 ^ those desiring
42991 ^ to pass
42992 ^ from here
42993 ^ to you
42995 ^ not
42996 ^ are able,
42997 ^ nor
42998 ^ from there
42999 ^ to us
43001 ^ can they pass.
43002 ^ he said
43003 ^ then,
43004 ^ i implore
43005 ^ you
43006 ^ then,
43007 ^ father,
43008 ^ that
43009 ^ you would send
43010 ^ him
43011 ^ to the house
43014 ^ of the father of me —
43017 ^ i have
43018 ^ for
43019 ^ five brothers —
43021 ^ so that
43022 ^ he might warn
43023 ^ them,
43024 ^ that
43025 ^ not
43026 ^ also
43027 ^ they
43028 ^ might come
43029 ^ to the place this
43033 ^ - of torment.
43035 ^ says
43036 ^ however
43037 ^ abraham,
43038 ^ they have
43039 ^ moses
43040 ^ and the prophets;
43043 ^ let them hear
43044 ^ them.
43045 ^ -
43046 ^ and
43047 ^ he said,
43048 ^ no,
43049 ^ father

43051 ^ but
43052 ^ if
43053 ^ one
43054 ^ from [the] dead
43056 ^ should go
43057 ^ to them,
43059 ^ they will repent.
43060 ^ he said
43061 ^ however
43062 ^ to him,
43063 ^ if
43064 ^ moses
43065 ^ and the prophets
43068 ^ not
43069 ^ they hear,
43070 ^ not even

43072 ^ one
43073 ^ out from [the] dead
43075 ^ should rise,
43076 ^ will they be persuaded.
43077 ^ he said
43078 ^ then
43079 ^ to the disciples of him,
43083 ^ impossible
43084 ^ it is
43085 ^ for
43086 ^ the stumbling blocks
43088 ^ not
43089 ^ to come,
43090 ^ but
43091 ^ woe [to him]
43092 ^ by whom
43094 ^ they come!
43095 ^ it is better
43096 ^ for him
43097 ^ if
43098 ^ a stone of a mill
43100 ^ is hung
43101 ^ around the neck of him
43105 ^ and
43106 ^ he is thrown
43107 ^ into the sea,
43110 ^ than
43111 ^ that
43112 ^ he should cause to stumble
43113 ^ - little of these one.
43117 ^ take heed
43118 ^ to yourselves.
43119 ^ if
43120 ^ should sin
43121 ^ the brother of you,
43124 ^ rebuke
43125 ^ him;
43126 ^ and
43127 ^ if
43128 ^ he should repent,
43129 ^ forgive
43130 ^ him.
43131 ^ and
43132 ^ if
43133 ^ seven times
43134 ^ in the day
43136 ^ he should sin
43137 ^ against you,
43139 ^ and
43140 ^ seven times
43141 ^ should return
43142 ^ to you,
43144 ^ saying
43145 ^ i repent,
43146 ^ you shall forgive
43147 ^ him.
43148 ^ and
43149 ^ said
43150 ^ the apostles
43152 ^ to the lord,
43154 ^ add
43155 ^ to us
43156 ^ faith!
43157 ^ said
43158 ^ then
43159 ^ the lord,
43161 ^ if
43162 ^ you have
43163 ^ faith
43164 ^ like a grain of mustard,
43167 ^ you would have said
43168 ^ -
43169 ^ to the mulberry tree this,
43172 ^ be uprooted
43173 ^ and
43174 ^ be planted
43175 ^ in the sea,
43178 ^ and
43179 ^ it would have obeyed
43180 ^ -
43181 ^ you.
43182 ^ which
43183 ^ now
43184 ^ of you
43186 ^ a servant
43187 ^ having,
43188 ^ plowing
43189 ^ or
43190 ^ shepherding,
43191 ^ the [one]
43192 ^ having come in
43193 ^ out of the field,
43196 ^ will say
43197 ^ to him,
43198 ^ immediately
43199 ^ having come,
43200 ^ recline?
43201 ^ but
43202 ^ not
43203 ^ will he say
43204 ^ to him,
43205 ^ prepare
43206 ^ what
43207 ^ i may eat,
43208 ^ and
43209 ^ having girded yourself about,
43210 ^ serve
43211 ^ me
43212 ^ while
43213 ^ i eat
43214 ^ and
43215 ^ drink;
43216 ^ and
43217 ^ after these things
43219 ^ shall eat
43220 ^ and
43221 ^ drink
43222 ^ you?’
43223 ^ not
43224 ^ is he
43225 ^ thankful
43226 ^ to the servant
43228 ^ because
43229 ^ he did
43230 ^ the things having been commanded?
43232 ^ thus
43233 ^ also
43234 ^ you,
43235 ^ when
43236 ^ you may have done
43237 ^ all
43238 ^ the [things] having been commanded
43240 ^ you,
43241 ^ say
43242 ^ -,
43243 ^ servants unworthy
43245 ^ are we;
43246 ^ that which
43247 ^ we were bound
43248 ^ to do,
43249 ^ we have done.
43250 ^ and
43251 ^ it came to pass
43252 ^ in the going up
43255 ^ to jerusalem
43257 ^ that
43258 ^ he
43259 ^ was passing
43260 ^ through [the] midst
43262 ^ of samaria
43263 ^ and galilee.
43265 ^ and
43266 ^ on entering
43267 ^ of him
43268 ^ into a certain village,
43271 ^ met
43272 ^ him
43273 ^ ten leprous men,
43276 ^ who
43277 ^ stood
43278 ^ afar off.
43279 ^ and
43280 ^ they
43281 ^ lifted up
43282 ^ [their] voice,
43283 ^ saying,
43284 ^ jesus,
43285 ^ master,
43286 ^ have compassion on
43287 ^ us.
43288 ^ and
43289 ^ having seen [them],
43290 ^ he said
43291 ^ to them,
43292 ^ having gone,
43293 ^ show
43294 ^ yourselves
43295 ^ to the priests.
43297 ^ and
43298 ^ it came to pass
43299 ^ in the going
43302 ^ them,
43303 ^ they were cleansed.
43304 ^ one
43305 ^ then
43306 ^ of them,
43308 ^ having seen
43309 ^ that
43310 ^ he was healed,
43311 ^ turned back,
43312 ^ with a voice loud
43315 ^ glorifying
43316 ^ - god,
43318 ^ and
43319 ^ he fell
43320 ^ on [his] face
43322 ^ at the feet of him,
43326 ^ giving thanks
43327 ^ to him;
43328 ^ and
43329 ^ he
43330 ^ was
43331 ^ a samaritan.
43332 ^ having answered
43333 ^ then,
43334 ^ - jesus
43336 ^ said,
43337 ^ not
43338 ^ the ten
43340 ^ were cleansed?
43341 ^ -
43342 ^ but
43343 ^ the nine
43344 ^ are where?
43345 ^ none
43346 ^ was there found
43347 ^ having returned
43348 ^ to give
43349 ^ glory
43350 ^ - to god,
43352 ^ if
43353 ^ not
43354 ^ the foreigner this?
43357 ^ and
43358 ^ he said
43359 ^ to him,
43360 ^ having risen up
43361 ^ go forth;
43362 ^ the faith of you
43365 ^ has cured
43366 ^ you!”
43367 ^ having been asked
43368 ^ now
43369 ^ by the pharisees
43372 ^ when
43373 ^ is coming
43374 ^ the kingdom
43376 ^ - of god,
43378 ^ he answered
43379 ^ them
43380 ^ and
43381 ^ said,
43382 ^ not
43383 ^ comes
43384 ^ the kingdom
43386 ^ - of god
43388 ^ with careful observation,
43390 ^ nor
43391 ^ will they say,
43392 ^ behold
43393 ^ here,
43394 ^ or
43395 ^ there.
43396 ^ behold
43397 ^ for,
43398 ^ the kingdom
43400 ^ - of god
43402 ^ in the midst of you
43404 ^ is.”
43405 ^ he said
43406 ^ then
43407 ^ to the disciples,
43410 ^ will come
43411 ^ days
43412 ^ when
43413 ^ you will desire
43414 ^ one
43415 ^ of the days
43417 ^ of the son
43419 ^ - of man
43421 ^ to see,
43422 ^ and
43423 ^ not
43424 ^ you will see [it].
43425 ^ and
43426 ^ they will say
43427 ^ to you,
43428 ^ behold
43429 ^ there,
43430 ^ or
43431 ^ behold
43432 ^ here.
43433 ^ not
43434 ^ go forth
43435 ^ nor
43436 ^ follow.
43437 ^ as
43438 ^ for
43439 ^ the lightning
43441 ^ flashing
43442 ^ from the [one end]
43444 ^ of the sky
43447 ^ to the [other end]
43449 ^ of the sky
43451 ^ shines,
43452 ^ thus
43453 ^ will be
43454 ^ the son
43456 ^ - of man
43458 ^ in the day of him.
43462 ^ first
43463 ^ however
43464 ^ it behooves
43465 ^ him
43466 ^ many things
43467 ^ to suffer,
43468 ^ and
43469 ^ to be rejected
43470 ^ by the generation this.
43474 ^ and
43475 ^ as
43476 ^ it came to pass
43477 ^ in the days of noah,
43481 ^ thus
43482 ^ will it be
43483 ^ also
43484 ^ in the days
43487 ^ of the son
43489 ^ of man:
43491 ^ they were eating,
43492 ^ they were drinking,
43493 ^ they were marrying,
43494 ^ they were being given in marriage,
43495 ^ until that day
43498 ^ entered
43499 ^ noah
43500 ^ into the ark,
43503 ^ and
43504 ^ came
43505 ^ the flood
43507 ^ and
43508 ^ destroyed
43509 ^ all.
43510 ^ likewise,
43511 ^ as
43512 ^ it came to pass
43513 ^ in the days of lot,
43517 ^ they were eating,
43518 ^ they were drinking,
43519 ^ they were buying,
43520 ^ they were selling,
43521 ^ they were planting,
43522 ^ they were building;
43523 ^ in that
43524 ^ then
43525 ^ day
43526 ^ went out
43527 ^ lot
43528 ^ from sodom,
43530 ^ it rained
43531 ^ fire
43532 ^ and brimstone
43534 ^ from heaven
43536 ^ and
43537 ^ destroyed
43538 ^ all.
43539 ^ according - to these
43542 ^ will it be
43543 ^ in that day
43545 ^ the son
43547 ^ - of man
43549 ^ is revealed.
43550 ^ in that - day,
43554 ^ the [one who]
43555 ^ will be
43556 ^ on the housetop,
43559 ^ and
43560 ^ the goods of him
43563 ^ in the house,
43566 ^ not
43567 ^ let him come down
43568 ^ to take away
43569 ^ them;
43570 ^ and
43571 ^ the [one]
43572 ^ in [the] field,
43574 ^ likewise
43575 ^ not
43576 ^ let him return
43577 ^ to the things behind.
43580 ^ remember
43581 ^ the wife of lot!
43584 ^ whoever
43585 ^ if
43586 ^ may seek
43587 ^ the life of him
43590 ^ to save,
43591 ^ will lose
43592 ^ it;
43593 ^ whoever
43594 ^ also
43595 ^ -
43596 ^ will lose [it],
43597 ^ will preserve
43598 ^ it.
43599 ^ i say
43600 ^ to you,
43601 ^ in that - night
43604 ^ there will be
43605 ^ two
43606 ^ upon bed one:
43609 ^ the one
43611 ^ will be taken,
43612 ^ and
43613 ^ the other
43615 ^ will be left.
43616 ^ there will be
43617 ^ two [women]
43618 ^ grinding
43619 ^ at the same [place]:
43622 ^ the one
43624 ^ will be taken,
43625 ^ -
43626 ^ and
43627 ^ the other
43628 ^ will be left.”
43629 ^ and
43630 ^ answering,
43631 ^ they say
43632 ^ to him,
43633 ^ where,
43634 ^ lord?
43635 ^ -
43636 ^ and
43637 ^ he said
43638 ^ to them,
43639 ^ where
43640 ^ the body [is],
43642 ^ there
43643 ^ also
43644 ^ the vultures
43646 ^ will be gathered together.
43647 ^ he was speaking
43648 ^ then
43649 ^ a parable
43650 ^ to them
43651 ^ about the [way] it behooves
43654 ^ always
43655 ^ to pray
43656 ^ them
43657 ^ and
43658 ^ not
43659 ^ to lose heart,
43660 ^ saying,
43661 ^ a judge
43662 ^ certain
43663 ^ there was
43664 ^ in a certain city,
43667 ^ - god
43669 ^ not
43670 ^ fearing
43671 ^ and
43672 ^ man
43673 ^ not
43674 ^ respecting.
43675 ^ a widow
43676 ^ then
43677 ^ there was
43678 ^ in the city that,
43682 ^ and
43683 ^ she was coming
43684 ^ to him,
43686 ^ saying,
43687 ^ avenge
43688 ^ me
43689 ^ of the adversary of me.
43693 ^ and
43694 ^ not
43695 ^ he would
43696 ^ for a time;
43698 ^ afterward
43699 ^ however
43700 ^ he
43701 ^ said
43702 ^ within himself,
43704 ^ if
43705 ^ even
43706 ^ - god
43708 ^ not
43709 ^ i fear,
43710 ^ nor
43711 ^ man
43712 ^ respect,
43713 ^ because
43714 ^ yet
43715 ^ - causes
43717 ^ me
43718 ^ trouble
43719 ^ the widow this,
43722 ^ i will avenge
43723 ^ her,
43724 ^ so that
43725 ^ not
43726 ^ to end
43728 ^ coming,
43729 ^ she exhaust
43730 ^ me.
43731 ^ said
43732 ^ then
43733 ^ the lord,
43735 ^ hear
43736 ^ what
43737 ^ the judge
43739 ^ - unrighteous
43741 ^ says.
43742 ^ -
43743 ^ and
43744 ^ god
43745 ^ no not
43747 ^ shall execute
43748 ^ the avenging
43750 ^ of the elect of him,
43753 ^ the [ones] crying out
43755 ^ to him
43756 ^ day
43757 ^ and night,
43759 ^ and
43760 ^ be deferring
43761 ^ in regard to them?
43763 ^ i say
43764 ^ to you
43765 ^ that
43766 ^ he will execute
43767 ^ the avenging of them
43770 ^ in quickness.
43772 ^ nevertheless,
43773 ^ the son
43775 ^ - of man
43777 ^ having come,
43778 ^ indeed
43779 ^ will he find
43780 ^ - faith
43782 ^ on the earth?
43785 ^ he spoke
43786 ^ now
43787 ^ also
43788 ^ to some
43790 ^ - trusting
43792 ^ in themselves
43794 ^ that
43795 ^ they are
43796 ^ righteous,
43797 ^ and
43798 ^ despising
43799 ^ the others,
43801 ^ the parable this:
43804 ^ men two
43806 ^ went up
43807 ^ into the temple
43810 ^ to pray,
43811 ^ the one
43813 ^ a pharisee,
43814 ^ and
43815 ^ the other
43817 ^ a tax collector.
43818 ^ the pharisee,
43820 ^ having stood,
43821 ^ toward himself
43823 ^ thus
43824 ^ was praying,
43825 ^ - god,
43827 ^ i thank
43828 ^ you
43829 ^ that
43830 ^ not
43831 ^ i am
43832 ^ like the rest
43835 ^ of the men —
43837 ^ swindlers, unrighteous, adulterers —
43840 ^ or
43841 ^ even
43842 ^ like this - tax collector.
43846 ^ i fast
43847 ^ twice
43848 ^ in the week;
43850 ^ i tithe
43851 ^ all things,
43852 ^ as many as
43853 ^ i gain.
43854 ^ -
43855 ^ but
43856 ^ the tax collector,
43857 ^ afar off
43858 ^ standing,
43859 ^ not
43860 ^ was willing
43861 ^ not even
43862 ^ the eyes
43864 ^ to lift up
43865 ^ to - heaven,
43868 ^ but
43869 ^ was striking
43870 ^ the breast of himself,
43873 ^ saying
43874 ^ -, god,
43876 ^ be merciful
43877 ^ to me,
43878 ^ the sinner!
43880 ^ i say
43881 ^ to you,
43882 ^ went down
43883 ^ this one
43884 ^ justified
43885 ^ to the house of him,
43889 ^ rather than that.
43891 ^ for
43892 ^ everyone
43893 ^ - exalting
43895 ^ himself
43896 ^ will be humbled;
43897 ^ the [one]
43898 ^ however
43899 ^ humbling
43900 ^ himself
43901 ^ will be exalted.
43902 ^ they were bringing
43903 ^ then
43904 ^ to him
43905 ^ also
43906 ^ the infants,
43908 ^ that
43909 ^ them
43910 ^ he might touch;
43911 ^ having seen
43912 ^ however,
43913 ^ the disciples
43915 ^ were rebuking
43916 ^ them.
43917 ^ -
43918 ^ but
43919 ^ jesus,
43920 ^ having called to [him]
43921 ^ them,
43922 ^ said,
43923 ^ permit
43924 ^ the little children
43926 ^ to come
43927 ^ to me,
43929 ^ and
43930 ^ not
43931 ^ do forbid
43932 ^ them;
43933 ^ of the
43934 ^ for
43935 ^ such
43936 ^ is
43937 ^ the kingdom
43939 ^ - of god.
43941 ^ truly
43942 ^ i say
43943 ^ to you,
43944 ^ whoever
43945 ^ -
43946 ^ not
43947 ^ shall receive
43948 ^ the kingdom
43950 ^ - of god
43952 ^ as a child,
43954 ^ no not
43956 ^ shall enter
43957 ^ into it.
43959 ^ and
43960 ^ asked
43961 ^ a certain
43962 ^ him
43963 ^ ruler,
43964 ^ saying,
43965 ^ teacher good,
43967 ^ what
43968 ^ having done,
43969 ^ life eternal
43971 ^ will i inherit?
43972 ^ said
43973 ^ then
43974 ^ to him
43975 ^ - jesus,
43977 ^ why
43978 ^ me

44006 ^ -
44007 ^ and
44008 ^ he said,
44009 ^ these all
44011 ^ have i kept
44012 ^ from [the] youth
44014 ^ having heard
44015 ^ then,
44016 ^ - jesus

44019 ^ to him,
44020 ^ yet
44021 ^ one thing
44022 ^ to you
44023 ^ is lacking:
44024 ^ all,

44027 ^ sell,
44028 ^ and
44029 ^ distribute
44030 ^ to [the] poor,
44031 ^ and

44041 ^ -
44042 ^ and
44043 ^ having heard
44044 ^ these things,
44045 ^ very sorrowful
44046 ^ he became;
44047 ^ he was
44048 ^ for

44051 ^ having seen
44052 ^ then
44053 ^ him,
44054 ^ - jesus
44056 ^ sorrowful
44057 ^ became,

44061 ^ those
44062 ^ - riches
44064 ^ having,
44065 ^ into the kingdom
44068 ^ - of god
44070 ^ shall enter.
44071 ^ easier
44072 ^ for
44073 ^ it is
44074 ^ a camel
44075 ^ through an eye of a needle
44078 ^ to go,
44079 ^ than
44080 ^ a rich man

44092 ^ who
44093 ^ is able
44094 ^ to be saved?
44095 ^ -

44123 ^ i say
44124 ^ to you
44125 ^ that
44126 ^ no one

44161 ^ having taken aside
44162 ^ then
44163 ^ the twelve,
44165 ^ he said
44166 ^ to them,
44168 ^ behold,
44169 ^ we go up
44170 ^ to jerusalem,
44172 ^ and
44173 ^ will be accomplished
44174 ^ all things
44175 ^ - having been written
44177 ^ by the prophets
44180 ^ about the son
44182 ^ - of man.
44184 ^ he will be betrayed
44185 ^ for
44186 ^ to the gentiles,

44203 ^ he will rise again.
44204 ^ and
44205 ^ they
44206 ^ none of these things
44208 ^ understood;
44209 ^ and
44210 ^ was
44211 ^ the word this
44214 ^ hidden
44215 ^ from them,
44217 ^ and
44218 ^ neither
44219 ^ they knew
44220 ^ the things being spoken.
44222 ^ it came to pass
44223 ^ then
44224 ^ in the drawing near
44227 ^ of him
44228 ^ to jericho,
44230 ^ a blind [man] certain
44232 ^ was sitting
44233 ^ beside the road,
44236 ^ begging.
44237 ^ having heard
44238 ^ now
44239 ^ a crowd
44240 ^ passing along,
44241 ^ he was asking
44242 ^ what
44243 ^ might be
44244 ^ this.
44245 ^ they told
44246 ^ then
44247 ^ him
44248 ^ -,
44249 ^ jesus
44250 ^ of nazareth
44252 ^ is passing by.
44253 ^ and
44254 ^ he called out
44255 ^ saying,
44256 ^ jesus,
44257 ^ son of david,
44259 ^ have mercy on
44260 ^ me.
44261 ^ and
44262 ^ those going before
44264 ^ were rebuking
44265 ^ him,
44266 ^ that
44267 ^ he should be silent.
44268 ^ he
44269 ^ however
44270 ^ much more
44272 ^ kept crying out,
44273 ^ son of david,
44275 ^ have mercy on
44276 ^ me.
44277 ^ having stopped
44278 ^ then,
44279 ^ - jesus
44281 ^ commanded
44282 ^ him
44283 ^ to be brought
44284 ^ to him.
44286 ^ having drawn near
44287 ^ then
44288 ^ him,
44289 ^ he asked
44290 ^ him,
44291 ^ what
44292 ^ to you
44293 ^ desire you
44294 ^ i shall do?
44295 ^ -
44296 ^ and
44297 ^ he said,
44298 ^ lord,
44299 ^ that
44300 ^ i might receive sight.
44301 ^ and
44302 ^ - jesus
44304 ^ said
44305 ^ to him,
44306 ^ receive sight!
44307 ^ the faith of you
44310 ^ has healed
44311 ^ you.
44312 ^ and
44313 ^ immediately
44314 ^ he received sight
44315 ^ and
44316 ^ began following
44317 ^ him,
44318 ^ glorifying
44319 ^ - god.
44321 ^ and
44322 ^ all the people,
44325 ^ having seen [it],
44326 ^ gave
44327 ^ praise
44328 ^ - to god.
44330 ^ and
44331 ^ having entered,
44332 ^ he was passing through
44333 ^ - jericho.
44335 ^ and
44336 ^ behold,
44337 ^ a man
44338 ^ by name
44339 ^ called
44340 ^ zacchaeus,
44341 ^ and
44342 ^ he
44343 ^ was
44344 ^ a chief tax collector,
44345 ^ and
44346 ^ he [was]
44347 ^ rich.
44348 ^ and
44349 ^ he was seeking
44350 ^ to see
44351 ^ - jesus,
44353 ^ who
44354 ^ he is,
44355 ^ and
44356 ^ not
44357 ^ he was able
44358 ^ because of the crowd,
44361 ^ because
44362 ^ - in stature small
44365 ^ he was.
44366 ^ and
44367 ^ having run
44368 ^ to the front
44371 ^ he went up
44372 ^ into a sycamore-fig tree,
44374 ^ so that
44375 ^ he might see
44376 ^ him,
44377 ^ for
44378 ^ that [way]
44379 ^ he was about
44380 ^ to pass.
44381 ^ and
44382 ^ as
44383 ^ he came
44384 ^ to the place,
44387 ^ having looked up,
44388 ^ - jesus
44390 ^ said
44391 ^ to him,
44393 ^ zacchaeus,
44394 ^ having hurried
44395 ^ come down;
44396 ^ today
44397 ^ for
44398 ^ in the house of you
44402 ^ it behooves
44403 ^ me
44404 ^ to stay.
44405 ^ and
44406 ^ having hurried,
44407 ^ he came down
44408 ^ and
44409 ^ received
44410 ^ him,
44411 ^ rejoicing.
44412 ^ and
44413 ^ having seen [it],
44414 ^ all
44415 ^ were grumbling,
44416 ^ saying
44417 ^ -,
44418 ^ with a sinful man
44421 ^ he has entered
44422 ^ to stay.
44423 ^ having stood
44424 ^ then,
44425 ^ zacchaeus
44426 ^ said
44427 ^ to the lord,
44430 ^ behold,
44431 ^ the half
44433 ^ of me of the possessions,
44436 ^ lord,
44437 ^ to the poor
44439 ^ i give;
44440 ^ and
44441 ^ if
44442 ^ of anyone anything
44444 ^ i have defrauded,
44445 ^ i restore [it]
44446 ^ fourfold.
44447 ^ said
44448 ^ then
44449 ^ to him
44451 ^ - jesus
44453 ^ -,
44454 ^ today
44455 ^ salvation
44456 ^ to the house this
44459 ^ has come,
44460 ^ because
44461 ^ also
44462 ^ he
44463 ^ a son of abraham
44465 ^ is.
44466 ^ came
44467 ^ for
44468 ^ the son
44470 ^ - of man
44472 ^ to seek
44473 ^ and
44474 ^ to save
44475 ^ that having been lost.
44477 ^ were hearing
44478 ^ while
44479 ^ they
44480 ^ these things,
44481 ^ having proceeded,
44482 ^ he spoke
44483 ^ a parable,
44484 ^ because -
44486 ^ near
44487 ^ being
44488 ^ jerusalem
44489 ^ of his,
44490 ^ and
44491 ^ thinking
44492 ^ their
44493 ^ that
44494 ^ immediately
44495 ^ is about
44496 ^ the kingdom
44498 ^ - of god
44500 ^ to appear.
44501 ^ he said
44502 ^ therefore,
44503 ^ a man
44504 ^ certain of noble birth
44506 ^ proceeded
44507 ^ to a country distant,
44510 ^ to receive
44511 ^ for himself
44512 ^ a kingdom
44513 ^ and
44514 ^ to return.
44515 ^ having called
44516 ^ then
44517 ^ ten servants of himself,
44520 ^ he gave
44521 ^ to them
44522 ^ ten minas
44524 ^ and
44525 ^ said
44526 ^ to them,
44528 ^ do business
44529 ^ until that
44531 ^ i come back.
44532 ^ -
44533 ^ but
44534 ^ the citizens of him
44536 ^ hated
44537 ^ him
44538 ^ and
44539 ^ sent
44540 ^ a delegation
44541 ^ after him,
44543 ^ saying,
44544 ^ not
44545 ^ we are willing [for]
44546 ^ this [man]
44547 ^ to reign
44548 ^ over us.
44550 ^ and
44551 ^ it came to pass
44552 ^ on the returning
44555 ^ of him,
44556 ^ having received
44557 ^ the kingdom,
44559 ^ that
44560 ^ he directed
44561 ^ to be called
44562 ^ to him
44563 ^ the servants
44565 ^ these
44566 ^ to whom
44567 ^ he had given
44568 ^ the money,
44570 ^ in order that
44571 ^ he might know
44572 ^ what
44573 ^ they had gained by trading.
44574 ^ came up
44575 ^ then
44576 ^ the first,
44578 ^ saying,
44579 ^ lord,
44580 ^ the mina of you,
44583 ^ ten
44584 ^ has produced
44585 ^ more minas.
44586 ^ and
44587 ^ he said
44588 ^ to him,
44589 ^ well done,
44590 ^ good servant!
44592 ^ because
44593 ^ in very little,
44595 ^ faithful
44596 ^ you were,
44597 ^ to be
44598 ^ having authority
44599 ^ you are
44600 ^ over ten cities.
44603 ^ and
44604 ^ came
44605 ^ the second,
44607 ^ saying,
44608 ^ the mina of you,
44611 ^ lord,
44612 ^ has made
44613 ^ five minas.
44615 ^ he said
44616 ^ then
44617 ^ also
44618 ^ to this one,
44619 ^ and
44620 ^ you
44621 ^ over
44622 ^ are to be
44623 ^ five cities.
44625 ^ and
44626 ^ - another
44628 ^ came,
44629 ^ saying,
44630 ^ lord,
44631 ^ behold
44632 ^ the mina of you,
44635 ^ which
44636 ^ i kept
44637 ^ lying away
44638 ^ in a piece of cloth.
44640 ^ i was afraid
44641 ^ for
44642 ^ of you,
44643 ^ because
44644 ^ a man harsh
44646 ^ you are.
44647 ^ you take up
44648 ^ what
44649 ^ not
44650 ^ you did lay down,
44651 ^ and
44652 ^ you reap
44653 ^ what
44654 ^ not
44655 ^ you did sow.
44656 ^ he says
44657 ^ to him,
44658 ^ out of the mouth of you
44662 ^ i will judge
44663 ^ you,
44664 ^ evil servant.
44666 ^ you knew
44667 ^ that
44668 ^ i
44669 ^ a man harsh
44671 ^ am,
44672 ^ taking up
44673 ^ what
44674 ^ not
44675 ^ i did lay down
44676 ^ and
44677 ^ reaping
44678 ^ what
44679 ^ not
44680 ^ i did sow?
44681 ^ then
44682 ^ because of why
44684 ^ not
44685 ^ did you give
44686 ^ of me the money
44689 ^ to [the] bank,
44691 ^ and i
44692 ^ having come,
44693 ^ with interest
44695 ^ -
44696 ^ it
44697 ^ might have collected?
44698 ^ and
44699 ^ to those standing by
44701 ^ he said,
44702 ^ take
44703 ^ from him
44705 ^ the mina,
44707 ^ and
44708 ^ give [it]
44709 ^ to the [one]
44710 ^ the ten minas
44713 ^ having.
44714 ^ and
44715 ^ they said
44716 ^ to him,
44717 ^ master,
44718 ^ he has
44719 ^ ten minas.
44721 ^ i say
44722 ^ to you
44723 ^ that
44724 ^ to everyone - having
44727 ^ will be given;
44728 ^ from
44729 ^ however
44730 ^ the [one]
44731 ^ not
44732 ^ having,
44733 ^ even
44734 ^ that which
44735 ^ he has
44736 ^ will be taken away.
44737 ^ furthermore,
44738 ^ the enemies of mine
44741 ^ these,
44742 ^ those
44743 ^ not
44744 ^ having been willing [for]
44745 ^ me
44746 ^ to reign
44747 ^ over them,
44749 ^ bring
44750 ^ here
44751 ^ and
44752 ^ slay
44753 ^ them
44754 ^ before me.
44756 ^ and
44757 ^ having said
44758 ^ these things
44759 ^ he went on
44760 ^ ahead,
44761 ^ going up
44762 ^ to jerusalem.
44764 ^ and
44765 ^ it came to pass
44766 ^ as
44767 ^ he drew near
44768 ^ to bethphage
44770 ^ and bethany,
44772 ^ toward the mount
44775 ^ - called
44777 ^ olivet,
44778 ^ he sent
44779 ^ two
44780 ^ of the disciples,
44782 ^ saying,
44783 ^ go
44784 ^ into the ahead village,
44788 ^ in which
44790 ^ entering
44791 ^ you will find
44792 ^ a colt
44793 ^ having been tied,
44794 ^ on which
44796 ^ no one
44797 ^ ever yet
44798 ^ of men
44799 ^ has sat;
44800 ^ and
44801 ^ having untied
44802 ^ it,
44803 ^ bring [it].
44804 ^ and
44805 ^ if
44806 ^ anyone
44807 ^ you
44808 ^ asks,
44809 ^ because of why
44811 ^ do you untie [it]?
44812 ^ thus
44813 ^ will you say,
44814 ^ because
44815 ^ the lord
44817 ^ of it need
44819 ^ has.’
44820 ^ having departed
44821 ^ then,
44822 ^ those having been sent
44824 ^ found [it]
44825 ^ as
44826 ^ he had said
44827 ^ to them.
44828 ^ on untying
44829 ^ then
44830 ^ of them
44831 ^ the colt,
44833 ^ said
44834 ^ the masters of it
44837 ^ to them,
44839 ^ why
44840 ^ untie you
44841 ^ the colt?
44843 ^ -
44844 ^ and
44845 ^ they said
44846 ^ -,
44847 ^ the lord
44849 ^ of it need
44851 ^ has.
44852 ^ and
44853 ^ they led
44854 ^ it
44855 ^ to - jesus,
44858 ^ and
44859 ^ having cast
44860 ^ their - garments
44863 ^ on the colt,
44866 ^ they put on [it]
44867 ^ - jesus.
44869 ^ going
44870 ^ then
44871 ^ of him,
44872 ^ they were spreading
44873 ^ the garments of them
44876 ^ on the road.
44879 ^ drawing near
44880 ^ then
44881 ^ of him
44882 ^ already
44883 ^ at the descent
44886 ^ of the mount
44888 ^ - of olives,
44890 ^ began
44891 ^ all the multitude
44894 ^ of the disciples,
44896 ^ rejoicing,
44897 ^ to praise
44898 ^ - god
44900 ^ in a voice loud
44902 ^ for
44903 ^ all
44904 ^ which
44905 ^ they had seen [the] mighty works,
44907 ^ saying:
44908 ^ blessed is
44909 ^ the coming - king
44913 ^ in [the] name of [the] lord.”
44916 ^ in heaven
44918 ^ peace,
44919 ^ and
44920 ^ glory
44921 ^ in [the] highest.
44923 ^ and
44924 ^ some
44925 ^ of the pharisees
44927 ^ from the crowd
44930 ^ said
44931 ^ to him,
44933 ^ teacher,
44934 ^ rebuke
44935 ^ the disciples of you.
44938 ^ and
44939 ^ answering,
44940 ^ he said,
44941 ^ i say
44942 ^ to you
44943 ^ if
44944 ^ these
44945 ^ will be silent,
44946 ^ the stones
44948 ^ will cry out.
44949 ^ and
44950 ^ as
44951 ^ he drew near,
44952 ^ having seen
44953 ^ the city,
44955 ^ he wept
44956 ^ over it,
44958 ^ saying
44959 ^ -,
44960 ^ if
44961 ^ you had known
44962 ^ in the day this,
44966 ^ even
44967 ^ you,
44968 ^ the things
44969 ^ for peace!
44971 ^ now
44972 ^ however
44973 ^ they are hidden
44974 ^ from eyes of you.
44977 ^ for
44978 ^ will come
44979 ^ days
44980 ^ upon you
44982 ^ that
44983 ^ will cast around
44984 ^ the enemies of you
44987 ^ a barricade
44988 ^ you;
44989 ^ and
44990 ^ they will surround
44991 ^ you
44992 ^ and
44993 ^ will hem in
44994 ^ you
44995 ^ on every side,
44996 ^ and
44997 ^ will level to the ground
44998 ^ you
44999 ^ and the children of you
45003 ^ within you,
45005 ^ and
45006 ^ not
45007 ^ will leave
45008 ^ a stone
45009 ^ upon a stone
45011 ^ within you,
45013 ^ in place of which
45015 ^ not
45016 ^ you knew
45017 ^ the season
45019 ^ the of visitation of you.
45022 ^ and
45023 ^ having entered
45024 ^ into the temple,
45027 ^ he began
45028 ^ to cast out
45029 ^ those selling,
45031 ^ saying
45032 ^ to them,
45033 ^ it has been written:
45034 ^ and
45035 ^ will be
45036 ^ the house of me
45039 ^ a house of prayer.’
45041 ^ you
45042 ^ however
45043 ^ it
45044 ^ have made
45045 ^ a den of robbers.’
45047 ^ and
45048 ^ he was
45049 ^ teaching
45050 ^ -
45051 ^ every day
45053 ^ in the temple;
45056 ^ the
45057 ^ however
45058 ^ chief priests
45059 ^ and the scribes
45062 ^ were seeking
45063 ^ him
45064 ^ to destroy,
45065 ^ and
45066 ^ the foremost
45068 ^ of the people.
45070 ^ and
45071 ^ not
45072 ^ they found
45073 ^ - what
45075 ^ they might do;
45076 ^ the people
45078 ^ for
45079 ^ all
45080 ^ were hanging on
45081 ^ his [words],
45082 ^ listening.
45083 ^ and
45084 ^ it came to pass
45085 ^ on one
45087 ^ of the days,
45089 ^ as was teaching
45090 ^ he
45091 ^ the people
45093 ^ in the temple
45096 ^ and
45097 ^ proclaiming the gospel,
45098 ^ came up
45099 ^ the chief priests
45101 ^ and the scribes
45104 ^ with the elders
45107 ^ and
45108 ^ spoke,
45109 ^ saying
45110 ^ to him,
45112 ^ tell
45113 ^ us
45114 ^ by what authority
45117 ^ these things
45118 ^ you do,
45119 ^ or
45120 ^ who
45121 ^ is
45122 ^ the [one] having given
45124 ^ to you
45125 ^ the authority this?
45128 ^ answering
45129 ^ now,
45130 ^ he said
45131 ^ to them,
45133 ^ will ask
45134 ^ you
45135 ^ i also
45136 ^ one thing,
45137 ^ and
45138 ^ you tell
45139 ^ me:
45140 ^ the baptism of john,
45143 ^ from heaven
45145 ^ was it,
45146 ^ or from men?
45149 ^ -
45150 ^ and
45151 ^ they reasoned
45152 ^ among themselves,
45154 ^ saying
45155 ^ -,
45156 ^ if
45157 ^ we should say
45158 ^ from heaven,
45160 ^ he will say,
45161 ^ because of why
45163 ^ not
45164 ^ did you believe
45165 ^ him?
45166 ^ if
45167 ^ however
45168 ^ we should say,
45169 ^ from men,
45171 ^ the people all
45174 ^ will stone
45175 ^ us;
45176 ^ having been persuaded
45177 ^ for
45178 ^ they are,
45179 ^ john
45180 ^ a prophet
45181 ^ to be.
45182 ^ and
45183 ^ they answered,
45184 ^ not
45185 ^ they knew
45186 ^ from where.
45187 ^ and
45188 ^ - jesus
45190 ^ said
45191 ^ to them,
45192 ^ neither
45193 ^ i
45194 ^ tell
45195 ^ you
45196 ^ by what authority
45199 ^ these things
45200 ^ i am doing.
45201 ^ he began
45202 ^ then
45203 ^ to the people
45206 ^ to speak
45207 ^ the parable this:
45210 ^ a man certain
45212 ^ planted
45213 ^ a vineyard,
45214 ^ and
45215 ^ rented
45216 ^ it
45217 ^ to farmers,
45218 ^ and
45219 ^ went abroad
45220 ^ a time long.
45222 ^ and
45223 ^ [in the] season,
45224 ^ he sent
45225 ^ to the farmers
45228 ^ a servant,
45229 ^ that
45230 ^ from the fruit
45233 ^ of the vineyard
45235 ^ they will give
45236 ^ to him.
45237 ^ -
45238 ^ but
45239 ^ the farmers
45240 ^ sent away
45241 ^ him,
45242 ^ having beaten [him],
45243 ^ empty-handed.
45244 ^ and
45245 ^ he proceeded
45246 ^ another
45247 ^ to send
45248 ^ a servant;
45249 ^ -
45250 ^ but
45251 ^ him
45252 ^ having beaten
45253 ^ and
45254 ^ having dishonored,
45255 ^ they sent away
45256 ^ empty-handed.
45257 ^ and
45258 ^ he proceeded
45259 ^ a third
45260 ^ to send;
45261 ^ -
45262 ^ then
45263 ^ also
45264 ^ him
45265 ^ having wounded,
45266 ^ they cast out.
45267 ^ said
45268 ^ then
45269 ^ the master
45271 ^ of the vineyard,
45273 ^ what
45274 ^ shall i do?
45275 ^ i will send
45276 ^ the son of me,
45279 ^ the beloved;
45281 ^ perhaps
45282 ^ him
45283 ^ they will respect.
45284 ^ having seen
45285 ^ now
45286 ^ him,
45287 ^ the farmers
45289 ^ began reasoning
45290 ^ among themselves,
45292 ^ saying,
45293 ^ this
45294 ^ is
45295 ^ the heir;
45297 ^ let us kill
45298 ^ him,
45299 ^ so that
45300 ^ ours
45301 ^ might become
45302 ^ the inheritance.
45304 ^ and
45305 ^ having cast forth
45306 ^ him
45307 ^ outside the vineyard,
45310 ^ they killed [him].
45311 ^ what
45312 ^ therefore
45313 ^ will do
45314 ^ to them
45315 ^ the master
45317 ^ of the vineyard?
45319 ^ he will come
45320 ^ and
45321 ^ will destroy
45322 ^ the farmers these,
45325 ^ and
45326 ^ will give
45327 ^ the vineyard
45329 ^ to others.
45330 ^ having heard [it],
45331 ^ then
45332 ^ they said,
45333 ^ never
45334 ^ may it be!
45335 ^ -
45336 ^ but
45337 ^ having looked at
45338 ^ them,
45339 ^ he said,
45340 ^ what
45341 ^ then
45342 ^ is
45343 ^ that has been written this:
45346 ^ [the] stone
45347 ^ which
45348 ^ rejected
45349 ^ those building,
45351 ^ this
45352 ^ has become
45353 ^ into [the] head of [the] corner’
45356 ^ everyone
45357 ^ - falling
45359 ^ on that - stone
45363 ^ will be broken;
45364 ^ on whomever
45366 ^ but
45367 ^ -
45368 ^ it might fall,
45369 ^ it will grind into powder
45370 ^ him.
45371 ^ and
45372 ^ sought
45373 ^ the scribes
45375 ^ and the chief priests
45378 ^ to lay
45379 ^ on him
45381 ^ - hands
45383 ^ in that - hour;
45387 ^ and
45388 ^ they feared
45389 ^ the people;
45391 ^ they perceived
45392 ^ for
45393 ^ that
45394 ^ against them
45396 ^ he was speaking
45397 ^ the parable this.
45400 ^ and
45401 ^ having watched [him],
45402 ^ they sent
45403 ^ spies,
45404 ^ feigning
45405 ^ themselves
45406 ^ righteous
45407 ^ to be,
45408 ^ that
45409 ^ they might catch
45410 ^ him
45411 ^ in talk,
45412 ^ in order
45413 ^ to deliver
45414 ^ him
45415 ^ to the rule
45417 ^ and to the authority
45420 ^ of the governor.
45422 ^ and
45423 ^ they questioned
45424 ^ him,
45425 ^ saying,
45426 ^ teacher,
45427 ^ we know
45428 ^ that
45429 ^ rightly
45430 ^ you speak
45431 ^ and
45432 ^ teach,
45433 ^ and
45434 ^ not
45435 ^ receive
45436 ^ [any] person,
45437 ^ but
45438 ^ on the basis of truth
45440 ^ the way
45442 ^ - of god
45444 ^ teach.
45445 ^ is it lawful
45446 ^ for us
45447 ^ to caesar
45448 ^ tribute
45449 ^ to give,
45450 ^ or
45451 ^ not?
45452 ^ having perceived
45453 ^ however
45454 ^ of them the craftiness,
45457 ^ he said
45458 ^ to them,
45460 ^ show
45461 ^ me
45462 ^ a denarius.
45463 ^ of whom
45464 ^ has it
45465 ^ [the] image
45466 ^ and inscription?
45468 ^ -
45469 ^ and
45470 ^ they said,
45471 ^ caesar’s.
45472 ^ -
45473 ^ and
45474 ^ he said
45475 ^ to them,
45477 ^ therefore
45478 ^ give back
45479 ^ the things of caesar
45481 ^ to caesar,
45482 ^ and
45483 ^ the things
45484 ^ - of god
45486 ^ - to god.
45488 ^ and
45489 ^ not
45490 ^ they were able
45491 ^ to catch him in
45492 ^ his
45493 ^ word
45494 ^ before the people;
45497 ^ and
45498 ^ having marveled
45499 ^ at the answer of him,
45503 ^ they became silent.
45504 ^ having approached
45505 ^ then
45506 ^ some
45507 ^ of the sadducees,
45509 ^ the ones denying
45511 ^ a resurrection
45512 ^ not
45513 ^ there is,
45514 ^ they questioned
45515 ^ him,
45516 ^ saying,
45517 ^ teacher,
45518 ^ moses
45519 ^ wrote
45520 ^ to us
45521 ^ if
45522 ^ anyone’s brother
45524 ^ should die
45525 ^ having
45526 ^ a wife,
45527 ^ and
45528 ^ he
45529 ^ childless
45530 ^ is,
45531 ^ that
45532 ^ should take
45533 ^ the brother of him
45536 ^ the wife
45538 ^ and
45539 ^ should raise up
45540 ^ seed
45541 ^ to the brother of him.
45544 ^ seven
45545 ^ therefore
45546 ^ brothers
45547 ^ there were;
45548 ^ and
45549 ^ the first,
45551 ^ having taken
45552 ^ a wife,
45553 ^ died
45554 ^ childless;
45555 ^ and
45556 ^ the second,
45558 ^ and
45559 ^ the third
45561 ^ took
45562 ^ her;
45563 ^ likewise
45564 ^ then
45565 ^ also
45566 ^ the seven
45568 ^ not
45569 ^ did leave
45570 ^ children,
45571 ^ and
45572 ^ died.
45573 ^ finally
45574 ^ also
45575 ^ the woman
45577 ^ died.
45578 ^ the woman
45580 ^ therefore,
45581 ^ in the resurrection,
45584 ^ of which of them
45586 ^ does she become
45587 ^ wife?
45588 ^ -
45589 ^ for
45590 ^ the seven
45591 ^ had
45592 ^ her
45593 ^ as wife.
45594 ^ and
45595 ^ said
45596 ^ to them
45597 ^ - jesus,
45599 ^ the sons
45601 ^ of the age this
45604 ^ marry
45605 ^ and
45606 ^ are given in marriage;
45607 ^ those
45608 ^ however
45609 ^ having been considered worthy
45610 ^ to the age that which [is]
45613 ^ to obtain,
45614 ^ and the resurrection
45617 ^ which [is]
45618 ^ out from [the] dead,
45620 ^ neither
45621 ^ marry
45622 ^ nor
45623 ^ are given in marriage;
45624 ^ neither
45625 ^ for
45626 ^ to die
45627 ^ any more
45628 ^ are they able,
45629 ^ like [the] angels
45630 ^ for
45631 ^ they are;
45632 ^ and
45633 ^ sons
45634 ^ they are
45635 ^ of god,
45636 ^ of the resurrection sons
45639 ^ being.
45640 ^ that
45641 ^ however
45642 ^ are raised
45643 ^ the dead,
45645 ^ even
45646 ^ moses
45647 ^ showed
45648 ^ at the bush,
45651 ^ when
45652 ^ he calls
45653 ^ [the] lord
45654 ^ the god of abraham,
45657 ^ and god of isaac,
45660 ^ and god of jacob.’
45663 ^ god
45664 ^ now
45665 ^ not
45666 ^ he is
45667 ^ of [the] dead,
45668 ^ but
45669 ^ of [the] living;
45670 ^ all
45671 ^ for
45672 ^ to him
45673 ^ live.
45674 ^ answering
45675 ^ now,
45676 ^ some
45677 ^ of the scribes
45679 ^ said,
45680 ^ teacher,
45681 ^ well
45682 ^ you have spoken.
45683 ^ no longer
45684 ^ then
45685 ^ did they dare
45686 ^ to ask
45687 ^ him
45688 ^ anything.
45689 ^ he said
45690 ^ then
45691 ^ to them,
45693 ^ how
45694 ^ do they declare
45695 ^ the christ
45697 ^ to be
45698 ^ of david son?
45700 ^ himself
45701 ^ for
45702 ^ david
45703 ^ says
45704 ^ in [the] book of psalms:
45707 ^ said
45708 ^ [the] lord
45709 ^ to the lord of me,
45712 ^ sit
45713 ^ at [the] right hand of me,
45716 ^ until
45717 ^ -
45718 ^ i place
45719 ^ the enemies of you,
45722 ^ [as] a footstool of the feet of you.”’
45726 ^ david
45727 ^ therefore
45728 ^ lord
45729 ^ him
45730 ^ calls,
45731 ^ and
45732 ^ how
45733 ^ of him son
45735 ^ is he?
45736 ^ were listening
45737 ^ now
45738 ^ all the people,
45741 ^ he said
45742 ^ to the disciples of him,
45745 ^ beware
45746 ^ of the scribes,
45749 ^ - desiring
45751 ^ to walk
45752 ^ in long robes,
45754 ^ and
45755 ^ loving
45756 ^ greetings
45757 ^ in the marketplaces,
45760 ^ and first seats
45762 ^ in the synagogues,
45765 ^ and first places
45767 ^ in the banquets;
45770 ^ who
45771 ^ devour
45772 ^ the houses
45774 ^ of widows,
45776 ^ and
45777 ^ as a pretext
45778 ^ at great length
45779 ^ pray.
45780 ^ these
45781 ^ will receive
45782 ^ more abundant condemnation.
45784 ^ having looked up
45785 ^ now,
45786 ^ he saw
45787 ^ the ones
45788 ^ casting
45789 ^ into the treasury
45792 ^ the gifts of them rich.
45796 ^ he saw
45797 ^ then
45798 ^ a certain widow poor
45801 ^ casting
45802 ^ in
45803 ^ lepta two.
45805 ^ and
45806 ^ he said,
45807 ^ truly
45808 ^ i say
45809 ^ to you
45810 ^ that
45811 ^ the widow
45813 ^ this
45814 ^ - poor,
45816 ^ more than all
45818 ^ has cast in;
45819 ^ all
45820 ^ for
45821 ^ these
45822 ^ out of that which was abounding to them
45826 ^ cast
45827 ^ in the gifts;
45830 ^ she
45831 ^ however,
45832 ^ out of the poverty of her,
45836 ^ all the livelihood
45839 ^ that
45840 ^ she had
45841 ^ did cast.
45842 ^ and
45843 ^ as some
45844 ^ were speaking
45845 ^ about the temple,
45848 ^ that
45849 ^ with stones goodly
45851 ^ and consecrated gifts
45853 ^ it was adorned,
45854 ^ he said,
45855 ^ [as to] these things
45856 ^ which
45857 ^ you are beholding,
45858 ^ will come
45859 ^ [the] days
45860 ^ in which
45862 ^ not
45863 ^ will be left
45864 ^ stone
45865 ^ upon stone
45867 ^ which
45868 ^ not
45869 ^ will be thrown down.
45870 ^ they asked
45871 ^ then
45872 ^ him,
45873 ^ saying,
45874 ^ teacher,
45875 ^ when
45876 ^ then
45877 ^ these things
45878 ^ will be,
45879 ^ and
45880 ^ what [will be]
45881 ^ the sign
45883 ^ when
45884 ^ are about
45885 ^ these things
45886 ^ to take place?
45887 ^ -
45888 ^ and
45889 ^ he said,
45890 ^ take heed,
45891 ^ lest
45892 ^ you be led astray;
45893 ^ many
45894 ^ for
45895 ^ will come
45896 ^ in the name of me,
45900 ^ saying,
45901 ^ i
45902 ^ am [he],
45903 ^ and
45904 ^ the time
45906 ^ is drawn near.
45907 ^ not
45908 ^ go
45909 ^ after them.
45911 ^ when
45912 ^ then
45913 ^ you should hear of
45914 ^ wars
45915 ^ and commotions,
45917 ^ not
45918 ^ be terrified;
45919 ^ it behooves
45920 ^ for
45921 ^ these things
45922 ^ to take place
45923 ^ first,
45924 ^ but
45925 ^ not
45926 ^ immediately [is]
45927 ^ the end.
45929 ^ then
45930 ^ he was saying
45931 ^ to them,
45932 ^ will rise up
45933 ^ nation
45934 ^ against nation,
45936 ^ and
45937 ^ kingdom
45938 ^ against kingdom.
45940 ^ earthquakes both great,
45943 ^ and
45944 ^ in different places famines
45947 ^ and pestilences
45949 ^ there will be;
45950 ^ fearful sights also
45952 ^ and
45953 ^ from heaven signs great
45957 ^ will there be.
45958 ^ before
45959 ^ however
45960 ^ these things all,
45962 ^ they will lay
45963 ^ upon you
45965 ^ the hands of them,
45968 ^ and
45969 ^ will persecute [you],
45970 ^ delivering [you]
45971 ^ to the synagogues
45974 ^ and prisons,
45976 ^ bringing [you]
45977 ^ before kings
45979 ^ and governors
45981 ^ on account of the name of me.
45985 ^ it will result
45986 ^ to you
45987 ^ for a testimony.
45989 ^ settle
45990 ^ therefore
45991 ^ in the minds of you
45995 ^ not
45996 ^ to premeditate
45997 ^ to make a defense;
45998 ^ i
45999 ^ for
46000 ^ will give
46001 ^ you
46002 ^ a mouth
46003 ^ and wisdom,
46005 ^ which
46006 ^ not
46007 ^ will be able
46008 ^ to resist
46009 ^ nor
46010 ^ to reply to
46011 ^ all
46012 ^ those opposing
46014 ^ you.
46015 ^ you will be betrayed
46016 ^ then
46017 ^ even
46018 ^ by parents
46020 ^ and brothers
46022 ^ and relatives
46024 ^ and friends,
46026 ^ and
46027 ^ they will put to death
46028 ^ [some] from among you.
46030 ^ and
46031 ^ you will be
46032 ^ hated
46033 ^ by all
46035 ^ because of the name of me.
46039 ^ but
46040 ^ a hair
46041 ^ of the head of you
46045 ^ no not
46047 ^ should perish.
46048 ^ by the patient endurance of you,
46052 ^ you will gain
46053 ^ the souls of you.
46056 ^ when
46057 ^ then
46058 ^ you see
46059 ^ being encircled
46060 ^ by encampments jerusalem,
46063 ^ then
46064 ^ know
46065 ^ that
46066 ^ has drawn near
46067 ^ the desolation of her.
46070 ^ then
46071 ^ those
46072 ^ in - judea,
46075 ^ let them flee
46076 ^ to the mountains;
46079 ^ and

46097 ^ these
46098 ^ are,
46099 ^ - to fulfill
46101 ^ all things - having been written.
46104 ^ but woe
46105 ^ to those
46106 ^ in womb

46109 ^ and to the [ones] nursing
46112 ^ in those the days;
46116 ^ there will be
46117 ^ for
46118 ^ distress great
46120 ^ upon the land
46123 ^ and wrath
46125 ^ to the people this.
46128 ^ and
46129 ^ they will fall
46130 ^ by [the] edge of [the] sword,
46132 ^ and
46133 ^ will be led captive
46134 ^ into the nations; all
46138 ^ and
46139 ^ jerusalem
46140 ^ will be
46141 ^ trodden down
46142 ^ by [the] gentiles,
46144 ^ until that
46146 ^ are fulfilled
46147 ^ [the] times of [the] gentiles.
46149 ^ and
46150 ^ there will be
46151 ^ signs
46152 ^ in sun,
46154 ^ and moon,
46156 ^ and stars;
46158 ^ and
46159 ^ upon the earth
46162 ^ distress of nations
46164 ^ with perplexity,
46166 ^ [the] roaring
46167 ^ of [the] sea
46168 ^ and rolling surge,
46170 ^ fainting
46171 ^ men
46172 ^ from fear
46174 ^ and expectation
46176 ^ of that which is coming
46178 ^ on the earth;
46180 ^ -
46181 ^ for
46182 ^ the powers
46183 ^ of the heavens
46185 ^ will be shaken.
46186 ^ and
46187 ^ then
46188 ^ will they see
46189 ^ the son
46191 ^ - of man
46193 ^ coming
46194 ^ in a cloud,
46196 ^ with power
46198 ^ and glory great.
46201 ^ beginning
46202 ^ then
46203 ^ of these things
46204 ^ to come to pass,
46205 ^ look up
46206 ^ and
46207 ^ lift up
46208 ^ the heads of you,
46211 ^ because
46212 ^ draws near
46213 ^ the redemption of you.
46216 ^ and
46217 ^ he spoke
46218 ^ a parable
46219 ^ to them:
46220 ^ behold
46221 ^ the fig tree
46223 ^ and all the trees.
46227 ^ when
46228 ^ they sprout
46229 ^ already,
46230 ^ looking [on them]
46231 ^ for yourselves,
46233 ^ you know
46234 ^ that
46235 ^ already
46236 ^ near
46237 ^ the summer
46239 ^ is.
46240 ^ so
46241 ^ also
46242 ^ you,
46243 ^ when
46244 ^ you see
46245 ^ these things
46246 ^ coming to pass,
46247 ^ know
46248 ^ that
46249 ^ near
46250 ^ is
46251 ^ the kingdom
46253 ^ - of god.
46255 ^ truly
46256 ^ i say
46257 ^ to you,
46258 ^ that
46259 ^ no not
46261 ^ will have passed away
46262 ^ the generation this,
46265 ^ until
46266 ^ -
46267 ^ all [these things]
46268 ^ shall have taken place.
46269 ^ the heaven
46271 ^ and the earth
46274 ^ will pass away,
46275 ^ -
46276 ^ but
46277 ^ the words of me
46279 ^ no not
46281 ^ will pass away.
46282 ^ take heed
46283 ^ now
46284 ^ to yourselves,
46285 ^ lest ever
46286 ^ be burdened
46287 ^ of you the hearts
46290 ^ with dissipation
46292 ^ and drunkenness
46294 ^ and cares of life —
46297 ^ and
46298 ^ would come
46299 ^ upon you
46301 ^ suddenly
46302 ^ the day that
46305 ^ as a snare.
46307 ^ it will come
46308 ^ for
46309 ^ upon all those sitting
46313 ^ upon the face
46315 ^ of all the earth.
46318 ^ watch
46319 ^ also
46320 ^ at every season,
46323 ^ praying
46324 ^ that
46325 ^ you may have strength
46326 ^ to escape
46327 ^ these things
46328 ^ all
46329 ^ that are about
46331 ^ to come to pass
46332 ^ and
46333 ^ to stand
46334 ^ before the son
46337 ^ - of man.
46339 ^ he was
46340 ^ now
46341 ^ during the day
46343 ^ in the temple
46346 ^ teaching,
46347 ^ -
46348 ^ and
46349 ^ the evening
46350 ^ going out,
46351 ^ he was lodging
46352 ^ on the mount
46355 ^ - called
46357 ^ olivet.
46358 ^ and
46359 ^ all the people
46362 ^ would come early in the morning
46363 ^ to him
46365 ^ in the temple
46368 ^ to hear
46369 ^ him.
46370 ^ was drawing near
46371 ^ now
46372 ^ the feast
46374 ^ of unleavened [bread],
46376 ^ - called
46378 ^ passover.
46379 ^ and
46380 ^ were seeking
46381 ^ the chief priests
46383 ^ and the scribes
46386 ^ - how
46388 ^ they might put to death
46389 ^ him;
46390 ^ they were afraid
46391 ^ for
46392 ^ of the people.
46394 ^ entered
46395 ^ then
46396 ^ satan
46397 ^ into judas,
46399 ^ the [one] being called
46401 ^ iscariot,
46402 ^ being
46403 ^ of the number
46406 ^ of the twelve.
46408 ^ and
46409 ^ having gone away,
46410 ^ he spoke with
46411 ^ the chief priests
46413 ^ and captains,
46415 ^ the how
46417 ^ to them
46418 ^ he might betray
46419 ^ him.
46420 ^ and
46421 ^ they rejoiced
46422 ^ and
46423 ^ agreed
46424 ^ him
46425 ^ money
46426 ^ to give.
46427 ^ and
46428 ^ he promised,
46429 ^ and
46430 ^ began seeking
46431 ^ opportunity
46432 ^ - to betray
46434 ^ him
46435 ^ apart from [a] crowd
46437 ^ to them.
46438 ^ came
46439 ^ then
46440 ^ the day
46442 ^ of unleavened [bread]
46444 ^ on which
46446 ^ it was necessary for
46447 ^ to be sacrificed
46448 ^ the passover lamb.
46450 ^ and
46451 ^ he sent
46452 ^ peter
46453 ^ and john,
46455 ^ having said,
46456 ^ having gone,
46457 ^ prepare
46458 ^ for us
46459 ^ the passover,
46461 ^ that
46462 ^ we might eat [it].
46463 ^ -
46464 ^ and
46465 ^ they said
46466 ^ to him,
46467 ^ where
46468 ^ will you
46469 ^ we should prepare?
46470 ^ -
46471 ^ and
46472 ^ he said
46473 ^ to them,
46474 ^ behold,
46475 ^ having entered
46476 ^ of you
46477 ^ into the city,
46480 ^ will meet
46481 ^ you
46482 ^ a man,
46483 ^ a pitcher of water
46485 ^ carrying;
46486 ^ follow
46487 ^ him
46488 ^ into the house
46491 ^ into which
46493 ^ he enters;
46494 ^ and
46495 ^ you shall say
46496 ^ to the master
46498 ^ of the house,
46500 ^ says
46501 ^ to you
46502 ^ the teacher,
46504 ^ where
46505 ^ is
46506 ^ the guest room,
46508 ^ where
46509 ^ the passover
46511 ^ with the disciples of me
46515 ^ i may eat?
46516 ^ and he
46517 ^ you
46518 ^ will show
46519 ^ an upper room
46520 ^ large,
46521 ^ furnished;
46522 ^ there
46523 ^ prepare.
46524 ^ having gone
46525 ^ then,
46526 ^ they found [it]
46527 ^ as
46528 ^ he had said
46529 ^ to them;
46530 ^ and
46531 ^ they prepared
46532 ^ the passover.
46534 ^ and
46535 ^ when
46536 ^ was come
46537 ^ the hour,
46539 ^ he reclined,
46540 ^ and
46541 ^ the apostles
46543 ^ with him.
46545 ^ and
46546 ^ he said
46547 ^ to them,
46549 ^ with desire
46550 ^ i have desired
46551 ^ this - passover
46554 ^ to eat
46555 ^ with you
46557 ^ before -
46559 ^ i
46560 ^ suffer.
46561 ^ i say
46562 ^ for
46563 ^ to you
46564 ^ that
46565 ^ never not
46567 ^ will i eat
46568 ^ thereof,
46569 ^ until when
46571 ^ it is fulfilled
46572 ^ in the kingdom
46575 ^ - of god.
46577 ^ and
46578 ^ having received
46579 ^ [the] cup,
46580 ^ having given thanks,
46581 ^ he said,
46582 ^ take
46583 ^ this,
46584 ^ and
46585 ^ divide [it]
46586 ^ among yourselves.
46588 ^ i say
46589 ^ for
46590 ^ to you,
46591 ^ that
46592 ^ no not
46594 ^ will i drink
46595 ^ from - now
46598 ^ of the fruit
46601 ^ of the vine,
46603 ^ until that
46605 ^ the kingdom
46607 ^ - of god
46609 ^ shall come.
46610 ^ and
46611 ^ having taken
46612 ^ [the] bread,
46613 ^ having given thanks,
46614 ^ he broke [it]
46615 ^ and
46616 ^ gave
46617 ^ to them,
46618 ^ saying,
46619 ^ this
46620 ^ is
46621 ^ the body of me,
46624 ^ which
46625 ^ for you
46627 ^ is given;
46628 ^ this
46629 ^ do
46630 ^ in the of me remembrance,
46634 ^ and
46635 ^ the cup
46637 ^ likewise
46638 ^ after which having supped,
46641 ^ saying,
46642 ^ this - cup [is]
46645 ^ the new covenant
46648 ^ in the blood of me,
46652 ^ which
46653 ^ for you
46655 ^ is being poured out.
46656 ^ but,
46657 ^ behold,
46658 ^ the hand
46660 ^ of him betraying
46662 ^ me
46663 ^ [is] with me
46665 ^ on the table.
46668 ^ for
46669 ^ the son
46671 ^ indeed
46672 ^ of man,
46674 ^ according to that having been determined
46677 ^ goes,
46678 ^ but
46679 ^ woe
46680 ^ to the man that
46683 ^ by whom
46685 ^ he is betrayed.
46686 ^ and
46687 ^ they
46688 ^ began
46689 ^ to question
46690 ^ among themselves
46692 ^ - who
46694 ^ then
46695 ^ it might be
46696 ^ of them
46698 ^ who
46699 ^ this
46700 ^ is about
46701 ^ to do.
46702 ^ there was
46703 ^ then
46704 ^ also
46705 ^ a dispute
46706 ^ among them,
46708 ^ - which of them
46711 ^ is thought
46712 ^ to be
46713 ^ [the] greatest.
46714 ^ -
46715 ^ and
46716 ^ he said
46717 ^ to them,
46718 ^ the kings
46720 ^ of the gentiles
46722 ^ rule over
46723 ^ them,
46724 ^ and
46725 ^ those exercising authority over
46727 ^ them,
46728 ^ benefactors
46729 ^ are called.
46730 ^ you
46731 ^ however
46732 ^ not
46733 ^ thus [shall be].

46945 ^ here [are]
46946 ^ two.
46947 ^ -
46948 ^ and

46950 ^ to them,
46951 ^ enough
46952 ^ it is.
46953 ^ and
46954 ^ having gone forth,
46955 ^ he went
46956 ^ according to the custom
46959 ^ to the mount
46962 ^ - of olives;

46968 ^ the disciples.
46970 ^ having come
46971 ^ then
46972 ^ to the place,
46975 ^ he said
46976 ^ to them,
46977 ^ pray
46978 ^ not
46979 ^ to enter
46980 ^ into temptation.
46982 ^ and
46983 ^ he
46984 ^ withdrew
46985 ^ from them
46987 ^ about a stone’s throw,
46990 ^ and
46991 ^ having fallen on
46992 ^ the knees,
46994 ^ he was praying,
46995 ^ saying,
46996 ^ father,
46997 ^ if
46998 ^ you are willing,
46999 ^ take away
47000 ^ this - cup
47003 ^ from me.
47005 ^ yet
47006 ^ not
47007 ^ the will of me,
47010 ^ but
47011 ^ - of you
47013 ^ be done.
47014 ^ appeared
47015 ^ then
47016 ^ to him
47017 ^ an angel
47018 ^ from heaven,
47020 ^ strengthening
47021 ^ him.
47022 ^ and
47023 ^ having been
47024 ^ in agony,
47026 ^ more earnestly
47027 ^ he was praying.
47028 ^ and
47029 ^ became
47030 ^ the sweat of him
47033 ^ like great drops
47035 ^ of blood,
47036 ^ falling down
47037 ^ upon the ground.
47040 ^ and
47041 ^ having risen up
47042 ^ from the prayer,
47045 ^ having come
47046 ^ to the disciples,
47049 ^ he found
47050 ^ sleeping them
47052 ^ from the grief,
47055 ^ and
47056 ^ he said
47057 ^ to them,
47058 ^ why
47059 ^ are you sleeping?
47060 ^ having risen up
47061 ^ pray,
47062 ^ that
47063 ^ not
47064 ^ you might enter
47065 ^ into temptation.
47067 ^ while still
47068 ^ of him
47069 ^ speaking,
47070 ^ behold,
47071 ^ a crowd,
47072 ^ and he who is called
47075 ^ judas,
47076 ^ one
47077 ^ of the twelve,
47079 ^ was going before
47080 ^ them,
47081 ^ and
47082 ^ he drew near
47083 ^ - to jesus
47085 ^ to kiss
47086 ^ him.
47087 ^ jesus
47088 ^ then
47089 ^ said
47090 ^ to him,
47091 ^ judas,
47092 ^ with a kiss
47093 ^ the son
47095 ^ - of man
47097 ^ are you betraying?
47098 ^ having seen
47099 ^ then
47100 ^ those
47101 ^ around him
47103 ^ what would be,
47105 ^ they said,
47106 ^ lord,
47107 ^ if
47108 ^ will we strike
47109 ^ with [the] sword?
47111 ^ and
47112 ^ struck
47113 ^ one a certain
47115 ^ of them
47117 ^ of the high priest the servant,
47121 ^ and
47122 ^ cut off
47123 ^ the ear, his
47126 ^ - right.
47128 ^ answering
47129 ^ now,
47130 ^ - jesus
47132 ^ said,
47133 ^ allow you
47134 ^ as far as thus!
47136 ^ and
47137 ^ having touched
47138 ^ the ear,
47140 ^ he healed
47141 ^ him.
47142 ^ said
47143 ^ then
47144 ^ jesus
47145 ^ to those
47147 ^ having come out
47148 ^ against him, chief priests,
47151 ^ and captains
47153 ^ of the temple,
47155 ^ and elders,
47157 ^ as against a robber
47160 ^ have you come out
47161 ^ with swords
47163 ^ and clubs?
47165 ^ every day
47167 ^ being
47168 ^ of me
47169 ^ with you
47171 ^ in the temple,
47174 ^ not
47175 ^ did you stretch out
47176 ^ the hands
47178 ^ against me;
47180 ^ but
47181 ^ this
47182 ^ is
47183 ^ of you the hour,
47186 ^ and the power
47189 ^ of the darkness.
47191 ^ having seized
47192 ^ then
47193 ^ him,
47194 ^ they led [him] away,
47195 ^ and
47196 ^ led [him]
47197 ^ into the house
47200 ^ of the high priest.
47202 ^ -
47203 ^ and
47204 ^ peter
47205 ^ was following
47206 ^ afar off.
47207 ^ they having kindled
47208 ^ then
47209 ^ a fire
47210 ^ in [the] midst
47212 ^ of the courtyard,
47214 ^ and
47215 ^ having sat down together,
47216 ^ was sitting
47217 ^ - peter
47219 ^ among them.
47221 ^ having seen
47222 ^ then
47223 ^ him
47224 ^ a servant girl certain
47226 ^ sitting
47227 ^ by the light,
47230 ^ and
47231 ^ having looked intently on
47232 ^ him,
47233 ^ she said,
47234 ^ also
47235 ^ this one
47236 ^ with him
47238 ^ was.
47239 ^ -
47240 ^ but
47241 ^ he denied [it],
47242 ^ saying,
47243 ^ not
47244 ^ i do know
47245 ^ him,
47246 ^ woman.
47247 ^ and
47248 ^ after a little,
47250 ^ another
47251 ^ having seen
47252 ^ him,
47253 ^ was saying,
47254 ^ also
47255 ^ you
47256 ^ of them
47258 ^ are.
47259 ^ -
47260 ^ but
47261 ^ peter
47262 ^ was saying,
47263 ^ man,
47264 ^ not
47265 ^ i am.
47266 ^ and
47267 ^ having elapsed
47268 ^ about hour one,
47271 ^ other a certain
47273 ^ strongly affirmed [it],
47274 ^ saying,
47275 ^ of a truth,
47277 ^ also
47278 ^ this one
47279 ^ with him
47281 ^ was;
47282 ^ also
47283 ^ for
47284 ^ a galilean
47285 ^ he is.
47286 ^ said
47287 ^ however
47288 ^ - peter,
47290 ^ man,
47291 ^ not
47292 ^ i know
47293 ^ what
47294 ^ you say.
47295 ^ and
47296 ^ immediately
47297 ^ while
47298 ^ he was speaking
47299 ^ of him,
47300 ^ crowed
47301 ^ the rooster.
47302 ^ and
47303 ^ having turned,
47304 ^ the lord
47306 ^ looked at
47307 ^ - peter,
47309 ^ and
47310 ^ remembered
47311 ^ - peter
47313 ^ the word
47315 ^ of the lord,
47317 ^ how
47318 ^ he had said
47319 ^ to him
47320 ^ -,
47321 ^ before
47322 ^ [the] rooster
47323 ^ crows
47324 ^ today,
47325 ^ you will deny
47326 ^ me
47327 ^ three times.
47328 ^ and
47329 ^ having gone forth
47330 ^ outside,
47331 ^ he wept
47332 ^ bitterly.
47333 ^ and
47334 ^ the men
47336 ^ who are holding
47338 ^ him
47339 ^ began mocking
47340 ^ him,
47341 ^ beating [him].
47342 ^ and
47343 ^ having blindfolded
47344 ^ him,
47345 ^ they were questioning [him],
47346 ^ saying,
47347 ^ prophesy,
47348 ^ who
47349 ^ is
47350 ^ the [one] having struck
47352 ^ you?
47353 ^ and
47354 ^ other things many,
47356 ^ blaspheming,
47357 ^ they were saying
47358 ^ to him.
47360 ^ and
47361 ^ when
47362 ^ it became
47363 ^ day,
47364 ^ were gathered together
47365 ^ the elderhood
47367 ^ of the people,
47369 ^ chief priests both
47371 ^ and scribes,
47373 ^ and
47374 ^ they led
47375 ^ him
47376 ^ into the council of them,
47380 ^ saying,
47381 ^ if
47382 ^ you
47383 ^ are
47384 ^ the christ,
47386 ^ tell
47387 ^ us.
47388 ^ he said
47389 ^ then
47390 ^ to them,
47391 ^ if
47392 ^ you
47393 ^ i should tell,
47394 ^ no not
47396 ^ would you believe;
47397 ^ if
47398 ^ then
47399 ^ i should ask [you],
47400 ^ no not
47402 ^ would you answer.
47403 ^ from - now on
47406 ^ also
47407 ^ will be
47408 ^ the son
47410 ^ - of man
47412 ^ sitting
47413 ^ at [the] right hand
47415 ^ of the power
47417 ^ - of god.
47419 ^ they said
47420 ^ then
47421 ^ all,
47422 ^ you
47423 ^ then
47424 ^ are
47425 ^ the son
47427 ^ - of god?
47429 ^ -
47430 ^ and
47431 ^ to them
47433 ^ he was saying,
47434 ^ you
47435 ^ say
47436 ^ that
47437 ^ i
47438 ^ am.
47439 ^ -
47440 ^ and
47441 ^ they said,
47442 ^ what
47443 ^ any more
47444 ^ have we
47445 ^ of witness need?
47447 ^ we ourselves
47448 ^ for
47449 ^ have heard [it]
47450 ^ from the mouth of him.
47454 ^ and
47455 ^ having risen up,
47456 ^ all the multitude of them
47460 ^ led
47461 ^ him
47462 ^ to - pilate.
47465 ^ they began
47466 ^ then
47467 ^ to accuse
47468 ^ him,
47469 ^ saying,
47470 ^ this [man]
47471 ^ we found
47472 ^ misleading
47473 ^ the nation of us
47476 ^ and
47477 ^ forbidding
47478 ^ tribute
47479 ^ to caesar
47480 ^ to be given,
47481 ^ and
47482 ^ declaring
47483 ^ himself
47484 ^ christ, a king,
47486 ^ to be.
47487 ^ -
47488 ^ and
47489 ^ pilate
47490 ^ questioned
47491 ^ him,
47492 ^ saying,
47493 ^ you
47494 ^ are
47495 ^ the king
47497 ^ of the jews?
47499 ^ -
47500 ^ and
47501 ^ answering
47502 ^ him,
47503 ^ he was saying,
47504 ^ you
47505 ^ say.
47506 ^ -
47507 ^ and
47508 ^ pilate
47509 ^ said
47510 ^ to the chief priests
47513 ^ and the crowds,
47516 ^ not
47517 ^ find i
47518 ^ guilt
47519 ^ in the man this.
47523 ^ -
47524 ^ but
47525 ^ they kept insisting,
47526 ^ saying
47527 ^ -,
47528 ^ he stirs up
47529 ^ the people,
47531 ^ teaching
47532 ^ throughout all - of judea,
47536 ^ and
47537 ^ he has begun
47538 ^ from - galilee
47541 ^ even to here.
47543 ^ pilate
47544 ^ now
47545 ^ having heard,
47546 ^ asked
47547 ^ whether
47548 ^ the man
47550 ^ a galilean
47551 ^ is,
47552 ^ and
47553 ^ having learned
47554 ^ that
47555 ^ from the jurisdiction of herod
47559 ^ he is,
47560 ^ he sent up
47561 ^ him
47562 ^ to herod,
47564 ^ being
47565 ^ also
47566 ^ he himself
47567 ^ in jerusalem
47569 ^ in those - days.
47573 ^ -
47574 ^ and
47575 ^ herod,
47576 ^ having seen
47577 ^ - jesus,
47579 ^ [was] glad
47580 ^ exceedingly;
47581 ^ he was
47582 ^ for
47583 ^ of a long time
47586 ^ wishing
47587 ^ to see
47588 ^ him,
47589 ^ because of - hearing
47592 ^ concerning him;
47594 ^ and
47595 ^ he was hoping
47596 ^ some sign
47598 ^ to see
47599 ^ by him
47601 ^ done.
47602 ^ he kept questioning
47603 ^ then
47604 ^ him
47605 ^ in words many;
47608 ^ he
47609 ^ however
47610 ^ nothing
47611 ^ answered
47612 ^ him.
47613 ^ had been standing by
47614 ^ now
47615 ^ the chief priests
47617 ^ and the scribes,
47620 ^ vehemently
47621 ^ accusing
47622 ^ him.
47623 ^ having set at naught
47624 ^ then
47625 ^ him,
47626 ^ also
47627 ^ - herod
47629 ^ with the troops of him,
47633 ^ and
47634 ^ having mocked [him],
47635 ^ having put on [him]
47636 ^ apparel splendid,
47638 ^ sent back
47639 ^ him
47640 ^ to pilate.
47642 ^ became
47643 ^ then
47644 ^ friends
47645 ^ - both herod
47648 ^ and - pilate
47651 ^ on that - day
47655 ^ with one another;
47657 ^ previously it had been that

48282 ^ the tomb
48284 ^ and
48285 ^ how
48286 ^ was laid
48287 ^ the body of him.
48290 ^ having returned
48291 ^ then,
48292 ^ they prepared
48293 ^ spices
48294 ^ and anointing oils.
48296 ^ and
48297 ^ on the
48298 ^ indeed

48300 ^ they rested
48301 ^ according to the commandment.
48304 ^ the
48305 ^ however
48306 ^ first [day]
48307 ^ of the week,

48315 ^ bringing
48316 ^ that

48321 ^ the stone
48323 ^ having been rolled away
48324 ^ from the tomb.
48327 ^ having entered

48329 ^ not
48330 ^ they found
48331 ^ the body
48333 ^ of the lord jesus.
48336 ^ and
48337 ^ it came to pass
48338 ^ while - are perplexed

48342 ^ about this,
48344 ^ that
48345 ^ behold,
48346 ^ men two

48350 ^ in garments
48352 ^ dazzling.
48353 ^ terrified
48354 ^ then
48355 ^ having become
48356 ^ of them
48357 ^ and
48358 ^ bowing
48359 ^ the faces
48361 ^ to the ground,
48364 ^ they said
48365 ^ to them,
48367 ^ why
48368 ^ seek you
48369 ^ the living
48371 ^ among the dead?
48374 ^ not
48375 ^ he is
48376 ^ here,
48377 ^ but
48378 ^ he is risen!
48379 ^ remember
48380 ^ how
48381 ^ he spoke
48382 ^ to you,
48383 ^ yet
48384 ^ being
48385 ^ in - galilee,
48388 ^ saying,
48389 ^ the son
48391 ^ - of man
48393 ^ -
48394 ^ it behooves
48395 ^ to be delivered
48396 ^ into hands
48398 ^ of men sinful,
48400 ^ and
48401 ^ to be crucified,
48402 ^ and
48403 ^ the third day
48406 ^ to arise.
48407 ^ and
48408 ^ they remembered
48409 ^ the words of him.
48412 ^ and
48413 ^ having returned
48414 ^ from the tomb,
48417 ^ they related
48418 ^ these things all
48420 ^ to the eleven
48422 ^ and to all the rest.
48426 ^ it was
48427 ^ now
48428 ^ - magdalene mary,
48431 ^ and joanna,
48433 ^ and mary
48435 ^ the [mother] of james,
48437 ^ and the other women
48440 ^ with them,
48442 ^ telling
48443 ^ to the apostles
48446 ^ these things.
48447 ^ and
48448 ^ appeared
48449 ^ before them
48451 ^ like folly
48453 ^ the words of them,
48456 ^ and
48457 ^ they did not believe
48458 ^ them.
48459 ^ -
48460 ^ but
48461 ^ peter,
48462 ^ having risen up,
48463 ^ ran
48464 ^ to the tomb,
48467 ^ and
48468 ^ having stooped down,
48469 ^ he sees
48470 ^ the linen strips only,
48473 ^ and
48474 ^ he went away,
48475 ^ in himself
48477 ^ wondering at
48478 ^ that having come to pass.
48480 ^ and
48481 ^ behold,
48482 ^ two
48483 ^ of them
48485 ^ on same the day
48489 ^ were
48490 ^ going
48491 ^ to a village
48493 ^ being distant,
48494 ^ stadia sixty
48496 ^ from jerusalem,
48498 ^ whose name [is]
48500 ^ emmaus;
48501 ^ and
48502 ^ they
48503 ^ were talking
48504 ^ with one another
48506 ^ about all -
48509 ^ having taken place these things.
48511 ^ and
48512 ^ it came to pass
48513 ^ in the talking
48516 ^ of them
48517 ^ and
48518 ^ reasoning,
48519 ^ that
48520 ^ himself
48521 ^ jesus,
48522 ^ having drawn near,
48523 ^ was walking along with
48524 ^ them;
48525 ^ -
48526 ^ but
48527 ^ the eyes of them
48529 ^ were held
48530 ^ -
48531 ^ not
48532 ^ to know
48533 ^ him.
48534 ^ he said
48535 ^ then
48536 ^ to them,
48538 ^ what
48539 ^ - words [are]
48541 ^ these
48542 ^ that
48543 ^ you exchange
48544 ^ with one another
48546 ^ walking?
48547 ^ and
48548 ^ they stood still,
48549 ^ looking sad.
48550 ^ answering
48551 ^ now,
48552 ^ [the] one
48553 ^ named cleopas
48555 ^ said
48556 ^ to him,
48558 ^ you
48559 ^ alone
48560 ^ visit
48561 ^ jerusalem
48562 ^ and
48563 ^ not
48564 ^ have known
48565 ^ the things having come to pass
48567 ^ in it
48569 ^ in the days these?
48573 ^ and
48574 ^ he said
48575 ^ to them,
48576 ^ what things?
48577 ^ -
48578 ^ and
48579 ^ they said
48580 ^ to him,
48581 ^ the things
48582 ^ concerning jesus
48584 ^ of nazareth,
48586 ^ who
48587 ^ was
48588 ^ a man,
48589 ^ a prophet
48590 ^ mighty
48591 ^ in deed
48593 ^ and word
48595 ^ before - god
48598 ^ and all the people;
48602 ^ that
48603 ^ then
48604 ^ delivered up
48605 ^ him
48606 ^ the chief priests
48608 ^ and the rulers of us
48612 ^ to [the] judgment of death,
48615 ^ and
48616 ^ crucified
48617 ^ him.
48618 ^ we
48619 ^ however
48620 ^ were hoping
48621 ^ -
48622 ^ he
48623 ^ it is
48624 ^ who is about
48626 ^ to redeem
48627 ^ - israel.
48629 ^ but
48630 ^ indeed
48631 ^ also
48632 ^ with all these things,
48635 ^ [the] third this day
48638 ^ brings,
48639 ^ away from which
48641 ^ these things
48642 ^ came to pass.
48643 ^ however
48644 ^ also
48645 ^ women certain
48647 ^ out from us
48649 ^ astonished
48650 ^ us.
48651 ^ having been
48652 ^ early
48653 ^ to the tomb
48656 ^ and
48657 ^ not
48658 ^ having found
48659 ^ the body of him,
48662 ^ they came
48663 ^ declaring
48664 ^ also
48665 ^ a vision of angels
48667 ^ to have seen,
48668 ^ who
48669 ^ say
48670 ^ he
48671 ^ is alive.
48672 ^ and
48673 ^ went
48674 ^ some
48675 ^ of those
48676 ^ with us
48678 ^ to the tomb
48681 ^ and
48682 ^ found [it]
48683 ^ so,
48684 ^ as
48685 ^ also
48686 ^ the women
48688 ^ said;
48689 ^ him
48690 ^ however
48691 ^ not
48692 ^ they saw.
48693 ^ and
48694 ^ he
48695 ^ said
48696 ^ to them,
48698 ^ o foolish
48700 ^ and
48701 ^ slow
48702 ^ - of heart
48704 ^ - to believe
48706 ^ in all
48708 ^ that
48709 ^ have spoken
48710 ^ the prophets.
48712 ^ not
48713 ^ these things
48714 ^ was it necessary for
48715 ^ to suffer
48716 ^ the christ
48718 ^ and
48719 ^ to enter
48720 ^ into the glory of him?
48724 ^ and
48725 ^ having begun
48726 ^ from moses
48728 ^ and from all the prophets,
48733 ^ he interpreted
48734 ^ to them
48735 ^ in all the scriptures
48739 ^ the things
48740 ^ concerning himself.
48742 ^ and
48743 ^ they drew near
48744 ^ to the village
48747 ^ where
48748 ^ they were going,
48749 ^ and
48750 ^ he
48751 ^ appeared
48752 ^ farther
48753 ^ to be going.
48754 ^ and
48755 ^ they constrained
48756 ^ him,
48757 ^ saying,
48758 ^ abide
48759 ^ with us,
48761 ^ for
48762 ^ toward evening
48764 ^ it is,
48765 ^ and
48766 ^ has declined
48767 ^ now
48768 ^ the day.
48770 ^ and
48771 ^ he entered in
48772 ^ - to abide
48774 ^ with them.
48776 ^ and
48777 ^ it came to pass
48778 ^ in the reclining
48781 ^ of him
48782 ^ with them,
48784 ^ having taken
48785 ^ the bread
48787 ^ he blessed [it],
48788 ^ and
48789 ^ having broken [it],
48790 ^ he began giving [it]
48791 ^ to them.
48792 ^ of them
48793 ^ then
48794 ^ were opened
48795 ^ the eyes,
48797 ^ and
48798 ^ they knew
48799 ^ him.
48800 ^ and
48801 ^ he
48802 ^ vanished
48803 ^ being seen
48804 ^ from them.
48806 ^ and
48807 ^ they said
48808 ^ to one another,
48810 ^ not
48811 ^ the heart of us
48814 ^ burning
48815 ^ was
48816 ^ within us
48818 ^ as
48819 ^ he was speaking
48820 ^ with us
48821 ^ on the road,
48824 ^ as
48825 ^ he was opening
48826 ^ to us
48827 ^ the scriptures?
48829 ^ and
48830 ^ having risen up
48831 ^ [that] same - hour,
48834 ^ they returned
48835 ^ to jerusalem,
48837 ^ and
48838 ^ they found
48839 ^ gathered together the eleven
48842 ^ and
48843 ^ those with them,
48846 ^ saying
48847 ^ -,
48848 ^ indeed
48849 ^ has risen
48850 ^ the lord
48852 ^ and
48853 ^ he has appeared
48854 ^ to simon.
48855 ^ and
48856 ^ they
48857 ^ began relating
48858 ^ the things
48859 ^ on the road,
48862 ^ and
48863 ^ how
48864 ^ he was known
48865 ^ to them
48866 ^ in the breaking
48869 ^ of the bread.
48871 ^ these things
48872 ^ now
48873 ^ of them
48874 ^ as they were telling,
48875 ^ he himself
48876 ^ stood
48877 ^ in midst of them
48880 ^ and
48881 ^ says
48882 ^ to them,
48883 ^ peace
48884 ^ to you.
48885 ^ having been terrified
48886 ^ however,
48887 ^ and
48888 ^ filled with fear
48889 ^ having been,
48890 ^ they were thinking [themselves]
48891 ^ a spirit
48892 ^ to see.
48893 ^ and
48894 ^ he said
48895 ^ to them,
48896 ^ why
48897 ^ troubled
48898 ^ are you,
48899 ^ and
48900 ^ through why
48902 ^ doubts
48903 ^ do come up
48904 ^ in the hearts of you?
48908 ^ see
48909 ^ the hands of me
48912 ^ and the feet of me,
48916 ^ that
48917 ^ i
48918 ^ am
48919 ^ he.
48920 ^ touch
48921 ^ me
48922 ^ and
48923 ^ see,
48924 ^ for
48925 ^ a spirit
48926 ^ flesh
48927 ^ and bones
48929 ^ not
48930 ^ has,
48931 ^ as
48932 ^ me
48933 ^ you see
48934 ^ having.
48935 ^ and
48936 ^ this
48937 ^ having said,
48938 ^ he showed
48939 ^ to them
48940 ^ the hands
48942 ^ and the feet.
48945 ^ still
48946 ^ now,
48947 ^ while they were disbelieving
48948 ^ of them
48949 ^ for the joy
48952 ^ and
48953 ^ amazement,
48954 ^ he said
48955 ^ to them,
48956 ^ have you
48957 ^ anything to eat
48959 ^ here?
48960 ^ -
48961 ^ and
48962 ^ they gave
48963 ^ to him
48964 ^ of a fish broiled part.
48967 ^ and
48968 ^ having taken [it],
48969 ^ before them
48971 ^ he ate [it].
48972 ^ he said
48973 ^ now
48974 ^ unto to them,
48976 ^ these [are]
48977 ^ the words of me,
48980 ^ which
48981 ^ i spoke
48982 ^ to you
48984 ^ still
48985 ^ being
48986 ^ with you,
48988 ^ that
48989 ^ it behooves
48990 ^ to be fulfilled
48991 ^ all things
48992 ^ - having been written
48994 ^ in the law of moses,
48998 ^ and the prophets
49001 ^ and [the] psalms
49003 ^ concerning me.
49005 ^ then
49006 ^ he opened
49007 ^ their - mind
49010 ^ - to understand
49012 ^ the scriptures.
49014 ^ and
49015 ^ he said
49016 ^ to them
49017 ^ -,
49018 ^ thus
49019 ^ it has been written:
49020 ^ was to suffer
49021 ^ the christ,
49023 ^ and
49024 ^ to rise
49025 ^ out from [the] dead
49027 ^ the
49028 ^ third day;
49030 ^ and
49031 ^ to be proclaimed
49032 ^ in the name of him
49036 ^ repentance
49037 ^ and forgiveness of sins
49040 ^ to all - nations,
49044 ^ having begun
49045 ^ from jerusalem.
49047 ^ you [are]
49048 ^ witnesses of these things.
49050 ^ and
49051 ^ behold,
49052 ^ i
49053 ^ am sending
49054 ^ the promise
49056 ^ of the father of me
49059 ^ upon you;
49061 ^ you
49062 ^ however
49063 ^ remain
49064 ^ in the city
49067 ^ until that
49069 ^ you should be clothed with
49070 ^ from on high
49072 ^ power.
49073 ^ he led
49074 ^ now
49075 ^ them
49076 ^ out
49077 ^ as far as to bethany,
49080 ^ and
49081 ^ having lifted up
49082 ^ the hands of him,
49085 ^ he blessed
49086 ^ them.
49087 ^ and
49088 ^ it came to pass
49089 ^ in the blessing
49092 ^ of him
49093 ^ them,
49094 ^ he was separated
49095 ^ from them
49097 ^ and
49098 ^ was carried up
49099 ^ into - heaven.
49102 ^ and
49103 ^ they
49104 ^ having worshiped
49105 ^ him,
49106 ^ returned
49107 ^ to jerusalem
49109 ^ with joy great,
49112 ^ and
49113 ^ were
49114 ^ continually all
49116 ^ in the temple,
49119 ^ blessing
49120 ^ - god.
49122 ^ in [the] beginning
49124 ^ was
49125 ^ the word,
49127 ^ and
49128 ^ the word
49130 ^ was
49131 ^ with - god,
49134 ^ and
49135 ^ god
49136 ^ was
49137 ^ the word.
49139 ^ he
49140 ^ was
49141 ^ in [the] beginning
49143 ^ with - god.
49146 ^ all things
49147 ^ through him
49149 ^ came into being,
49150 ^ and
49151 ^ without him
49153 ^ came into being
49154 ^ not even
49155 ^ one [thing]
49156 ^ that
49157 ^ has come into being.
49158 ^ in him
49160 ^ life
49161 ^ was,
49162 ^ and
49163 ^ the life
49165 ^ was
49166 ^ the light
49168 ^ - of men.
49170 ^ and
49171 ^ the light
49173 ^ in the darkness
49176 ^ shines,
49177 ^ and
49178 ^ the darkness
49180 ^ it
49181 ^ not
49182 ^ overcame.
49183 ^ there came
49184 ^ a man
49185 ^ having been sent
49186 ^ from god;
49188 ^ [the] name to him
49190 ^ [was] john.
49191 ^ he
49192 ^ came
49193 ^ as a witness,
49195 ^ that
49196 ^ he might testify
49197 ^ concerning the light,
49200 ^ that
49201 ^ all
49202 ^ might believe
49203 ^ through him.
49205 ^ not
49206 ^ was
49207 ^ he
49208 ^ the light,
49210 ^ but
49211 ^ that
49212 ^ he might witness
49213 ^ concerning the light.
49216 ^ was
49217 ^ the light
49219 ^ - true,
49221 ^ who
49222 ^ enlightens
49223 ^ every man,
49225 ^ coming
49226 ^ into the world.
49229 ^ in the world
49232 ^ he was,
49233 ^ and
49234 ^ the world
49236 ^ through him
49238 ^ came into being,
49239 ^ and
49240 ^ the world
49242 ^ him
49243 ^ not
49244 ^ knew.
49245 ^ to the own
49248 ^ he came,
49249 ^ and
49250 ^ the own
49252 ^ him
49253 ^ not
49254 ^ received.
49255 ^ as many as
49256 ^ however
49257 ^ received
49258 ^ him,
49259 ^ he gave
49260 ^ to them
49261 ^ authority
49262 ^ children of god
49264 ^ to be,
49265 ^ to those believing
49267 ^ in the name of him,
49271 ^ who
49272 ^ not
49273 ^ of blood,
49275 ^ nor of will of flesh,
49279 ^ nor of will of man,
49283 ^ but
49284 ^ of god
49286 ^ were born.
49287 ^ and
49288 ^ the word
49290 ^ flesh
49291 ^ became
49292 ^ and
49293 ^ dwelt
49294 ^ among us,
49296 ^ and
49297 ^ we beheld
49298 ^ the glory of him,
49301 ^ a glory
49302 ^ as of an only begotten
49304 ^ from [the] father,
49306 ^ full
49307 ^ of grace
49308 ^ and truth.
49310 ^ john
49311 ^ witnesses
49312 ^ concerning him,
49314 ^ and
49315 ^ he cried out,
49316 ^ saying,
49317 ^ this
49318 ^ was he
49319 ^ of whom
49320 ^ i was saying,
49321 ^ the [one]
49322 ^ after me
49324 ^ coming,
49325 ^ precedence over me
49327 ^ has,
49328 ^ because
49329 ^ before me
49331 ^ he was.’
49332 ^ for
49333 ^ from the fullness of him,
49337 ^ we all
49339 ^ have received
49340 ^ then
49341 ^ grace
49342 ^ for grace.
49344 ^ for
49345 ^ the law
49347 ^ through moses
49349 ^ was given;
49350 ^ - grace
49352 ^ and - truth
49355 ^ through jesus christ
49358 ^ came.
49359 ^ god
49360 ^ no one
49361 ^ has seen
49362 ^ ever yet;
49363 ^ [the] only begotten god,
49365 ^ the [one] being
49367 ^ in the bosom
49370 ^ of the father,
49372 ^ he
49373 ^ has made [him] known.
49374 ^ and
49375 ^ this
49376 ^ is
49377 ^ the testimony
49379 ^ - of john,
49381 ^ when
49382 ^ sent
49383 ^ to him
49385 ^ the jews
49387 ^ from jerusalem,
49389 ^ priests
49390 ^ and levites,
49392 ^ that
49393 ^ they might ask
49394 ^ him,
49395 ^ you,
49396 ^ who
49397 ^ are?
49398 ^ and
49399 ^ he confessed
49400 ^ and
49401 ^ not
49402 ^ denied,
49403 ^ but
49404 ^ confessed
49405 ^ -,
49406 ^ i
49407 ^ not
49408 ^ am
49409 ^ the christ.
49411 ^ and
49412 ^ they asked
49413 ^ him,
49414 ^ what
49415 ^ then?
49416 ^ you
49417 ^ elijah
49418 ^ are?
49419 ^ and
49420 ^ he says,
49421 ^ not
49422 ^ i am.
49423 ^ the prophet
49425 ^ are
49426 ^ you?
49427 ^ and
49428 ^ he answered,
49429 ^ no.
49430 ^ they said
49431 ^ therefore
49432 ^ to him,
49433 ^ who
49434 ^ are you?
49435 ^ that
49436 ^ an answer
49437 ^ we might give
49438 ^ to those having sent
49440 ^ us;
49441 ^ what
49442 ^ say you
49443 ^ about yourself?
49445 ^ he was saying,
49446 ^ i [am]
49447 ^ a voice
49448 ^ crying
49449 ^ in the wilderness,
49452 ^ make straight
49453 ^ the way of [the] lord,’”
49456 ^ as
49457 ^ said
49458 ^ isaiah
49459 ^ the prophet.
49461 ^ and
49462 ^ [those] having been sent
49463 ^ were
49464 ^ out from the pharisees.
49467 ^ and
49468 ^ they asked
49469 ^ him
49470 ^ and
49471 ^ said
49472 ^ to him,
49473 ^ why
49474 ^ then
49475 ^ baptize you,
49476 ^ if
49477 ^ you
49478 ^ not
49479 ^ are
49480 ^ the christ,
49482 ^ nor
49483 ^ elijah,
49484 ^ nor
49485 ^ the prophet?
49487 ^ answered
49488 ^ them
49489 ^ - john
49491 ^ saying,
49492 ^ i
49493 ^ baptize
49494 ^ with water;
49496 ^ but in [the] midst of you
49498 ^ stands [one]
49499 ^ whom
49500 ^ you
49501 ^ not
49502 ^ know,
49503 ^ the [one]
49504 ^ after me

49507 ^ of whom
49508 ^ not
49509 ^ am
49510 ^ i
49511 ^ worthy
49512 ^ that
49513 ^ i should untie
49514 ^ of him the strap
49517 ^ of the sandal.
49519 ^ these things
49520 ^ in bethany
49522 ^ took place,
49523 ^ across the jordan,
49526 ^ where
49527 ^ was
49528 ^ - john
49530 ^ baptizing.
49531 ^ on the next day

49534 ^ - jesus
49536 ^ coming
49537 ^ to him
49539 ^ and

52309 ^ so that
52310 ^ you
52311 ^ may marvel.
52312 ^ even as

52316 ^ raises up
52317 ^ the dead
52319 ^ and
52320 ^ gives life,
52321 ^ thus
52322 ^ also
52323 ^ the son
52325 ^ to whom
52326 ^ he will,
52327 ^ gives life.
52328 ^ not even
52329 ^ for
52330 ^ the father
52332 ^ judges
52333 ^ no one,
52334 ^ but

54237 ^ then
54238 ^ the jews,
54240 ^ saying,
54241 ^ how
54242 ^ this one
54243 ^ writings
54244 ^ knows,
54245 ^ not
54246 ^ having studied?
54247 ^ answered
54248 ^ therefore
54249 ^ them
54250 ^ - jesus
54252 ^ and
54253 ^ said
54254 ^ -, my teaching

54267 ^ the will of him
54270 ^ to do,
54271 ^ he will know
54272 ^ concerning the teaching,
54275 ^ whether
54276 ^ from - god
54279 ^ it is,
54280 ^ or
54281 ^ i
54282 ^ from myself
54284 ^ speak.
54285 ^ the [one]
54286 ^ from himself
54288 ^ speaking,
54289 ^ the glory

54296 ^ seeking
54297 ^ the glory
54299 ^ of the [one] having sent
54301 ^ him,
54302 ^ he
54303 ^ true

54305 ^ and
54306 ^ unrighteousness
54307 ^ in him

54321 ^ keeps
54322 ^ the law?
54324 ^ why
54325 ^ me
54326 ^ do you seek
54327 ^ to kill?
54328 ^ answered
54329 ^ the crowd,
54331 ^ a demon
54332 ^ you have;
54333 ^ who
54334 ^ you

54338 ^ jesus
54339 ^ and
54340 ^ said
54341 ^ to them,
54342 ^ one work
54344 ^ i did,
54345 ^ and
54346 ^ all
54347 ^ you marvel.

54351 ^ has given
54352 ^ you
54353 ^ - circumcision —
54355 ^ not
54356 ^ that
54357 ^ of - moses

54361 ^ but
54362 ^ of the fathers —
54365 ^ also
54366 ^ on sabbath
54368 ^ you circumcise

54371 ^ circumcision
54372 ^ receives
54373 ^ a man
54374 ^ on sabbath
54376 ^ so that

54378 ^ might be broken
54379 ^ the law of moses,
54382 ^ with me

56270 ^ answered
56271 ^ therefore
56272 ^ the parents of him

56310 ^ he will speak.
56311 ^ these things
56312 ^ said
56313 ^ the parents of him
56316 ^ because
56317 ^ they were afraid
56318 ^ of the jews;
56320 ^ already
56321 ^ for
56322 ^ had agreed together
56323 ^ the jews
56325 ^ that
56326 ^ if
56327 ^ anyone
56328 ^ him
56329 ^ should confess

56369 ^ then
56370 ^ he,
56371 ^ whether

56388 ^ to you?

56404 ^ do you wish
56405 ^ to hear?
56406 ^ not
56407 ^ also
56408 ^ you
56409 ^ do wish
56410 ^ his disciples
56412 ^ to become?
56413 ^ and
56414 ^ they railed at
56415 ^ him
56416 ^ and
56417 ^ said,
56418 ^ you
56419 ^ a disciple

56442 ^ the man
56444 ^ and
56445 ^ said
56446 ^ to them,
56447 ^ in this
56449 ^ for
56450 ^ - an amazing thing

56458 ^ he is,
56459 ^ and yet
56460 ^ he opened
56461 ^ my - eyes.
56464 ^ we know
56465 ^ that
56466 ^ sinners
56467 ^ - god
56469 ^ not

56507 ^ to him,
56508 ^ in sins
56510 ^ you

56512 ^ entirely,
56513 ^ and
56514 ^ you

56917 ^ because of this,
56919 ^ me

57365 ^ the sisters
57367 ^ to him,
57369 ^ saying,
57370 ^ lord,
57371 ^ behold,
57372 ^ [he] whom
57373 ^ you love
57374 ^ is sick.
57375 ^ having heard
57376 ^ then,
57377 ^ - jesus
57379 ^ said,
57380 ^ this - sickness
57383 ^ not
57384 ^ is
57385 ^ unto death,
57387 ^ but
57388 ^ for the glory
57391 ^ - of god,
57393 ^ that
57394 ^ may be glorified
57395 ^ the son
57397 ^ - of god
57399 ^ by it.
57401 ^ loved
57402 ^ now
57403 ^ - jesus
57405 ^ - martha,
57407 ^ and the sister of her,
57411 ^ and - lazarus.
57414 ^ when
57415 ^ therefore
57416 ^ he heard
57417 ^ that
57418 ^ he is sick,
57419 ^ then
57420 ^ indeed
57421 ^ he remained
57422 ^ in which
57424 ^ he was
57425 ^ [the] place
57426 ^ two days.
57428 ^ then
57429 ^ after this
57431 ^ he says
57432 ^ to the disciples,
57434 ^ let us go
57435 ^ into - judea
57438 ^ again.
57439 ^ say
57440 ^ to him
57441 ^ the disciples,
57443 ^ rabbi,
57444 ^ just now
57445 ^ were seeking
57446 ^ you
57447 ^ to stone
57448 ^ the jews,
57450 ^ and
57451 ^ again
57452 ^ you are going
57453 ^ there?
57454 ^ answered
57455 ^ jesus,
57456 ^ not
57457 ^ twelve hours
57459 ^ are there
57460 ^ in the day?
57462 ^ if
57463 ^ anyone
57464 ^ walks
57465 ^ in the day,
57468 ^ not
57469 ^ he stumbles,
57470 ^ because
57471 ^ the light
57473 ^ the world of this
57476 ^ he sees;
57477 ^ if
57478 ^ however
57479 ^ anyone
57480 ^ walks
57481 ^ in the night,
57484 ^ he stumbles,
57485 ^ because
57486 ^ the light
57488 ^ not
57489 ^ is
57490 ^ in him.
57492 ^ these things
57493 ^ he said,
57494 ^ and
57495 ^ after this
57497 ^ he says
57498 ^ to them,
57499 ^ lazarus
57500 ^ the friend of us
57503 ^ has fallen asleep,
57504 ^ but
57505 ^ i go
57506 ^ that
57507 ^ i may awaken
57508 ^ him.
57509 ^ said
57510 ^ therefore
57511 ^ the disciples
57513 ^ of him,
57514 ^ lord,
57515 ^ if
57516 ^ he has fallen asleep,
57517 ^ he will get well.
57518 ^ had spoken
57519 ^ however
57520 ^ - jesus
57522 ^ of the death of him;
57526 ^ they
57527 ^ however
57528 ^ thought
57529 ^ that
57530 ^ of the rest
57533 ^ - of sleep
57535 ^ he speaks.
57536 ^ then
57537 ^ therefore
57538 ^ said
57539 ^ to them
57540 ^ - jesus
57542 ^ plainly,
57543 ^ lazarus
57544 ^ has died.
57545 ^ and
57546 ^ i rejoice

57549 ^ in order that
57550 ^ you might believe,
57551 ^ that
57552 ^ not
57553 ^ i was
57554 ^ there.
57555 ^ but
57556 ^ let us go
57557 ^ to him.
57559 ^ said
57560 ^ therefore
57561 ^ thomas,
57562 ^ - called
57564 ^ didymus,
57565 ^ to the fellow disciples,
57567 ^ let go
57568 ^ also
57569 ^ us,
57570 ^ that
57571 ^ we may die
57572 ^ with him.
57574 ^ having come
57575 ^ therefore,
57576 ^ - jesus
57578 ^ found
57579 ^ him,
57580 ^ four
57581 ^ already
57582 ^ days
57583 ^ having been
57584 ^ in the tomb.
57587 ^ was
57588 ^ now
57589 ^ - bethany
57591 ^ near - jerusalem,
57594 ^ about away stadia fifteen.
57598 ^ many
57599 ^ now
57600 ^ of the jews
57603 ^ had come
57604 ^ unto - martha
57607 ^ and mary
57609 ^ that
57610 ^ they might console
57611 ^ them
57612 ^ concerning the brother.
57615 ^ -
57616 ^ therefore
57617 ^ martha,
57618 ^ when
57619 ^ she heard
57620 ^ that
57621 ^ jesus
57622 ^ is coming,

57624 ^ him;
57625 ^ mary
57626 ^ however
57627 ^ in the house
57630 ^ was sitting.
57631 ^ said
57632 ^ then
57633 ^ - martha
57635 ^ to - jesus,
57638 ^ lord,
57639 ^ if
57640 ^ you had been
57641 ^ here,
57642 ^ not
57643 ^ -
57644 ^ would have died
57645 ^ the brother of me.
57648 ^ nevertheless
57649 ^ even
57650 ^ now
57651 ^ i know
57652 ^ that
57653 ^ whatever
57654 ^ -
57655 ^ you might ask
57656 ^ - god,
57658 ^ will give
57659 ^ you
57660 ^ - god.
57662 ^ says
57663 ^ to her
57664 ^ - jesus,
57666 ^ will rise again
57667 ^ the brother of you.
57670 ^ says
57671 ^ to him
57672 ^ - martha,
57674 ^ i know
57675 ^ that
57676 ^ he will rise again
57677 ^ in the resurrection
57680 ^ in the last day.

57685 ^ to her
57686 ^ - jesus,
57688 ^ i

57697 ^ in me,
57699 ^ even if
57700 ^ he should die,
57701 ^ he will live;
57702 ^ and
57703 ^ everyone - living
57706 ^ and
57707 ^ believing
57708 ^ in me,
57710 ^ never not
57712 ^ shall die,
57713 ^ to the age.
57716 ^ believe you
57717 ^ this?
57718 ^ she says
57719 ^ to him,

57737 ^ coming.
57738 ^ and
57739 ^ these things
57740 ^ having said,
57741 ^ she went away
57742 ^ and
57743 ^ called
57744 ^ mary,
57745 ^ the sister of her,
57748 ^ secretly,
57749 ^ having said,
57750 ^ the teacher
57752 ^ is come,
57753 ^ and
57754 ^ he calls

58093 ^ will take away
58094 ^ of us both the place
58098 ^ and the nation.
58101 ^ one
58102 ^ however
58103 ^ certain
58104 ^ of them, caiaphas,
58107 ^ high priest
58108 ^ being
58109 ^ the year same,
58112 ^ said
58113 ^ to them,
58114 ^ you
58115 ^ not
58116 ^ know
58117 ^ nothing,
58118 ^ nor
58119 ^ consider you
58120 ^ that
58121 ^ it is profitable
58122 ^ for you
58123 ^ that
58124 ^ one man
58126 ^ should die
58127 ^ for the people,
58130 ^ and

58136 ^ this
58137 ^ now
58138 ^ from himself
58140 ^ not
58141 ^ he said,
58142 ^ but
58143 ^ high priest
58144 ^ being
58145 ^ the year that,
58148 ^ he prophesied
58149 ^ that
58150 ^ was about

58152 ^ to die
58153 ^ for the nation,
58156 ^ and
58157 ^ not

58162 ^ but
58163 ^ that
58164 ^ also
58165 ^ the children
58167 ^ - of god,
58169 ^ those having been scattered,
58171 ^ he might gather together
58172 ^ into one.
58174 ^ from that
58176 ^ therefore
58177 ^ - day
58179 ^ they took counsel together
58180 ^ that
58181 ^ they might kill
58182 ^ him.
58183 ^ -
58184 ^ therefore
58185 ^ jesus
58186 ^ no longer
58187 ^ publicly
58188 ^ walked
58189 ^ among the jews,
58192 ^ but
58193 ^ went away
58194 ^ from there
58195 ^ into the region
58198 ^ near the wilderness,
58201 ^ to
58202 ^ ephraim
58203 ^ called a city.
58205 ^ and there
58206 ^ he stayed
58207 ^ with the disciples.
58210 ^ was
58211 ^ now
58212 ^ near
58213 ^ the passover
58215 ^ of the jews,
58217 ^ and
58218 ^ went up
58219 ^ many
58220 ^ to jerusalem
58222 ^ out of the region
58225 ^ before the passover,
58228 ^ so that
58229 ^ they might purify
58230 ^ themselves.
58231 ^ they were seeking
58232 ^ therefore
58233 ^ - jesus
58235 ^ and
58236 ^ were saying
58237 ^ among one another
58239 ^ in the temple
58242 ^ standing,
58243 ^ what
58244 ^ does it seem
58245 ^ to you,
58246 ^ that
58247 ^ no not
58249 ^ he will come
58250 ^ to the feast?
58253 ^ had given
58254 ^ now
58255 ^ the chief priests
58257 ^ and the pharisees
58260 ^ a command
58261 ^ that
58262 ^ if
58263 ^ anyone
58264 ^ should know
58265 ^ where
58266 ^ he is,
58267 ^ he should show [it],
58268 ^ so that
58269 ^ they might seize
58270 ^ him.
58271 ^ -
58272 ^ therefore
58273 ^ jesus,
58274 ^ before six days
58277 ^ the passover,
58279 ^ came
58280 ^ to bethany,
58282 ^ where
58283 ^ was
58284 ^ lazarus,
58285 ^ whom
58286 ^ had raised
58287 ^ out from [the] dead
58289 ^ jesus.
58290 ^ they made
58291 ^ therefore
58292 ^ him
58293 ^ a supper
58294 ^ there,
58295 ^ and
58296 ^ - martha
58298 ^ was serving,
58299 ^ -
58300 ^ and
58301 ^ lazarus
58302 ^ one
58303 ^ was
58304 ^ of those reclining
58307 ^ with him.
58309 ^ -
58310 ^ therefore
58311 ^ mary,
58312 ^ having taken
58313 ^ a litra
58314 ^ of fragrant oil
58315 ^ of nard pure of great price,
58318 ^ anointed
58319 ^ the feet
58321 ^ - of jesus
58323 ^ and
58324 ^ wiped
58325 ^ with the hair of her
58328 ^ the feet of him;
58331 ^ the
58332 ^ now
58333 ^ house
58334 ^ was filled
58335 ^ with the fragrance
58338 ^ of the oil.
58340 ^ says
58341 ^ however
58342 ^ judas
58343 ^ - iscariot,
58345 ^ one
58346 ^ of the disciples of him,
58350 ^ - being about
58352 ^ him
58353 ^ to betray,
58354 ^ because of why
58356 ^ this - fragrant oil
58359 ^ not
58360 ^ was sold
58361 ^ for three hundred denarii
58363 ^ and
58364 ^ given
58365 ^ to [the] poor?
58366 ^ he said
58367 ^ however
58368 ^ this,
58369 ^ not
58370 ^ because
58371 ^ for the poor
58374 ^ he was caring
58375 ^ to him,
58376 ^ but
58377 ^ because
58378 ^ a thief
58379 ^ he was,
58380 ^ and
58381 ^ the money bag
58383 ^ having,
58384 ^ that being put into [it]
58386 ^ he used to pilfer.
58387 ^ said
58388 ^ therefore
58389 ^ - jesus,
58391 ^ leave alone
58392 ^ her,
58393 ^ so that
58394 ^ for the day
58397 ^ of the burial of me
58400 ^ she may keep
58401 ^ it;
58402 ^ the poor
58404 ^ for
58405 ^ always
58406 ^ you have
58407 ^ with you;
58409 ^ me
58410 ^ however

58413 ^ you have.
58414 ^ knew
58415 ^ therefore
58416 ^ - a crowd great
58419 ^ of the jews
58422 ^ that
58423 ^ there
58424 ^ he is;
58425 ^ and
58426 ^ they came,
58427 ^ not
58428 ^ because of - jesus
58431 ^ only,
58432 ^ but
58433 ^ that
58434 ^ also
58435 ^ - lazarus
58437 ^ they might see,
58438 ^ whom
58439 ^ he had raised
58440 ^ out from [the] dead.
58442 ^ took counsel
58443 ^ however
58444 ^ the chief priests
58446 ^ that
58447 ^ also
58448 ^ - lazarus
58450 ^ they might kill,
58451 ^ because
58452 ^ many
58453 ^ on account of him
58455 ^ were going away
58456 ^ of the jews
58458 ^ and
58459 ^ were believing
58460 ^ in - jesus.
58463 ^ on the next day
58465 ^ the crowd
58467 ^ great
58468 ^ - having come
58470 ^ to the feast,

58474 ^ that
58475 ^ is coming
58476 ^ - jesus
58478 ^ into jerusalem,
58480 ^ took
58481 ^ the branches
58483 ^ of the palm trees
58485 ^ and
58486 ^ went out
58487 ^ to meet him,
58490 ^ and
58491 ^ were shouting:

58493 ^ blessed is
58494 ^ the [one] coming
58496 ^ in [the] name of [the] lord!”
58499 ^ and
58500 ^ the king
58502 ^ - of israel!”
58504 ^ having found
58505 ^ then
58506 ^ - jesus
58508 ^ a young donkey,
58509 ^ he sat
58510 ^ upon it,
58512 ^ as
58513 ^ it is
58514 ^ written:

58517 ^ daughter of zion.
58519 ^ behold,
58520 ^ the king of you
58523 ^ comes,
58524 ^ sitting
58525 ^ on a colt of a donkey.”
58528 ^ these things
58529 ^ not
58530 ^ knew
58531 ^ of him the disciples
58534 ^ from the first,
58536 ^ but
58537 ^ when
58538 ^ was glorified
58539 ^ jesus,
58540 ^ then
58541 ^ they remembered
58542 ^ that
58543 ^ these things
58544 ^ were
58545 ^ of him
58547 ^ written,
58548 ^ and
58549 ^ these things
58550 ^ they had done
58551 ^ to him.
58552 ^ continued to bear witness
58553 ^ therefore
58554 ^ the crowd
58556 ^ - being
58558 ^ with him
58560 ^ when
58561 ^ - lazarus
58563 ^ he called
58564 ^ out of the tomb
58567 ^ and
58568 ^ raised
58569 ^ him
58570 ^ out from [the] dead.
58572 ^ on account of this
58574 ^ also
58575 ^ met
58576 ^ him
58577 ^ the crowd,
58579 ^ because
58580 ^ they heard
58581 ^ this
58582 ^ of his
58583 ^ having done
58584 ^ the sign.
58586 ^ -
58587 ^ therefore
58588 ^ the pharisees
58589 ^ said
58590 ^ among themselves,
58592 ^ you see
58593 ^ that
58594 ^ not
58595 ^ you gain
58596 ^ nothing.
58597 ^ behold,
58598 ^ the world
58600 ^ after him
58602 ^ has gone.
58603 ^ there were
58604 ^ now
58605 ^ greeks certain
58607 ^ among those coming up
58610 ^ that
58611 ^ they might worship
58612 ^ at the feast;
58615 ^ these
58616 ^ therefore
58617 ^ came
58618 ^ to philip,
58619 ^ who was
58620 ^ from bethsaida
58622 ^ - of galilee,
58624 ^ and
58625 ^ they were asking
58626 ^ him
58627 ^ saying,
58628 ^ sir,
58629 ^ we desire
58630 ^ - jesus
58632 ^ to see.
58633 ^ comes

58653 ^ saying,
58654 ^ has come
58655 ^ the hour
58657 ^ that

58695 ^ the [one] hating
58697 ^ the life of him
58700 ^ in the world this,

58750 ^ on account of this
58752 ^ i came
58753 ^ to the hour this.
58757 ^ father,
58758 ^ glorify
58759 ^ of you the name.
58762 ^ came
58763 ^ therefore
58764 ^ a voice
58765 ^ from - heaven:
58768 ^ both
58769 ^ i have glorified [it],
58770 ^ and
58771 ^ again
58772 ^ i will glorify [it].
58773 ^ -
58774 ^ therefore
58775 ^ the crowd
58776 ^ - having stood
58778 ^ and
58779 ^ having heard
58780 ^ was saying,
58781 ^ thunder
58782 ^ there has been.
58783 ^ others
58784 ^ were saying,
58785 ^ an angel
58786 ^ to him
58787 ^ has spoken.
58788 ^ answered
58789 ^ jesus
58790 ^ and
58791 ^ said
58792 ^ not
58793 ^ because of me
58795 ^ the voice this
58798 ^ has come,
58799 ^ but
58800 ^ because of you.
58802 ^ now
58803 ^ [the] judgment
58804 ^ is
58805 ^ the world of this;
58808 ^ now
58809 ^ the prince
58811 ^ of the world this
58814 ^ will be cast
58815 ^ out.
58816 ^ and i,
58817 ^ if
58818 ^ i am lifted up
58819 ^ from the earth,
58822 ^ all
58823 ^ will draw
58824 ^ to myself.
58826 ^ this
58827 ^ now
58828 ^ he was saying,
58829 ^ signifying
58830 ^ by what death
58832 ^ he was about
58833 ^ to die.
58834 ^ answered
58835 ^ then
58836 ^ him
58837 ^ the crowd,
58839 ^ we
58840 ^ have heard
58841 ^ from the law
58844 ^ that
58845 ^ the christ
58847 ^ abides
58848 ^ to the age,
58851 ^ and
58852 ^ how
58853 ^ say
58854 ^ you
58855 ^ that
58856 ^ it behooves
58857 ^ to be lifted up
58858 ^ the son
58860 ^ - of man?
58862 ^ who
58863 ^ is
58864 ^ this - son
58867 ^ - of man?
58869 ^ said
58870 ^ therefore
58871 ^ to them
58872 ^ - jesus,
58874 ^ yet
58875 ^ a little while
58877 ^ the light
58879 ^ with you
58881 ^ is.
58882 ^ walk
58883 ^ while
58884 ^ the light
58886 ^ you have,
58887 ^ so that
58888 ^ not
58889 ^ darkness
58890 ^ you
58891 ^ might overtake.
58892 ^ and
58893 ^ the [one] walking
58895 ^ in the darkness
58898 ^ not
58899 ^ knows
58900 ^ where
58901 ^ he is going.
58902 ^ while
58903 ^ the light
58905 ^ you have,
58906 ^ believe
58907 ^ in the light,
58910 ^ so that
58911 ^ sons of light
58913 ^ you may become.
58914 ^ these things
58915 ^ spoke
58916 ^ jesus,
58917 ^ and
58918 ^ having gone away,
58919 ^ he was hidden
58920 ^ from them.
58922 ^ so many
58923 ^ however
58924 ^ of him
58925 ^ signs
58926 ^ having been done
58927 ^ before them,
58929 ^ not
58930 ^ they believed
58931 ^ in him,
58933 ^ so that
58934 ^ the word
58936 ^ of isaiah
58937 ^ the prophet
58939 ^ might be fulfilled
58940 ^ that
58941 ^ said:
58942 ^ lord,
58943 ^ who
58944 ^ has believed
58945 ^ the report of us?
58948 ^ and
58949 ^ the arm of [the] lord
58952 ^ to whom
58953 ^ has been revealed?”
58954 ^ because of this,
58956 ^ not
58957 ^ they were able
58958 ^ to believe,
58959 ^ for
58960 ^ again
58961 ^ said
58962 ^ isaiah:
58963 ^ he has blinded
58964 ^ of them the eyes,
58967 ^ and
58968 ^ has hardened
58969 ^ of them the heart,
58972 ^ that
58973 ^ not
58974 ^ they should see
58975 ^ with the eyes,
58977 ^ and
58978 ^ understand
58979 ^ with the heart,
58981 ^ and
58982 ^ turn,
58983 ^ and
58984 ^ i will heal
58985 ^ them.”
58986 ^ these things
58987 ^ said
58988 ^ isaiah
58989 ^ because
58990 ^ he saw
58991 ^ the glory of him
58994 ^ and
58995 ^ spoke
58996 ^ concerning him.
58998 ^ nevertheless,
58999 ^ indeed
59000 ^ even
59001 ^ of the rulers many
59005 ^ believed
59006 ^ in him;
59008 ^ but
59009 ^ on account of the pharisees
59012 ^ not
59013 ^ they were confessing,
59014 ^ so that
59015 ^ not
59016 ^ put out of the synagogue
59017 ^ they might be;
59018 ^ they loved
59019 ^ for
59020 ^ the glory
59022 ^ - of men
59024 ^ more
59025 ^ than
59026 ^ the glory
59028 ^ - of god.
59030 ^ jesus
59031 ^ then
59032 ^ cried out
59033 ^ and
59034 ^ said,
59035 ^ the [one] believing
59037 ^ in me,
59039 ^ not

59041 ^ in me,
59043 ^ but
59044 ^ in the [one] having sent
59047 ^ me;
59048 ^ and
59049 ^ the [one] beholding
59051 ^ me,
59052 ^ beholds
59053 ^ the [one] having sent
59055 ^ me.
59056 ^ i
59057 ^ a light
59058 ^ into the world
59061 ^ have come,
59062 ^ so that
59063 ^ everyone - believing
59066 ^ in me,
59068 ^ in the darkness
59071 ^ not
59072 ^ should abide.
59073 ^ and
59074 ^ if
59075 ^ anyone
59076 ^ of me
59077 ^ hears
59078 ^ the words
59080 ^ and

59097 ^ the world.
59099 ^ the [one] rejecting

59105 ^ the words of me
59108 ^ has
59109 ^ [one] judging
59111 ^ him:
59112 ^ the word
59114 ^ which

59131 ^ having sent
59132 ^ me father himself,
59135 ^ me
59136 ^ a commandment
59137 ^ gave
59138 ^ what
59139 ^ i should say
59140 ^ and
59141 ^ what
59142 ^ i should speak.
59143 ^ and

59163 ^ before
59164 ^ now
59165 ^ the feast
59167 ^ of the passover,
59169 ^ knowing
59170 ^ - jesus
59172 ^ that

59174 ^ his - hour,
59177 ^ that
59178 ^ he would depart
59179 ^ out of the world this
59183 ^ to the father,

59239 ^ the garments.
59241 ^ and
59242 ^ having taken
59243 ^ a towel,
59244 ^ he girded
59245 ^ himself.
59246 ^ after that,
59247 ^ he pours
59248 ^ water
59249 ^ into the basin,
59252 ^ and
59253 ^ he began
59254 ^ to wash

59274 ^ you
59275 ^ of me
59276 ^ do wash
59277 ^ the feet?
59279 ^ answered

59282 ^ said
59283 ^ to him,
59284 ^ what
59285 ^ i
59286 ^ do
59287 ^ you

59298 ^ no not
59300 ^ shall you wash
59301 ^ of me the feet

59356 ^ clean
59357 ^ are,
59358 ^ but
59359 ^ not

59361 ^ he knew
59362 ^ for
59363 ^ the [one who] was betraying

59429 ^ you,
59430 ^ that
59431 ^ as
59432 ^ i
59433 ^ did
59434 ^ to you,

59470 ^ whom
59471 ^ i chose,
59472 ^ but
59473 ^ that
59474 ^ the scripture
59476 ^ may be fulfilled:
59477 ^ the [one] eating
59479 ^ of me the bread
59482 ^ lifted up
59483 ^ against me
59485 ^ the heel of him.’
59488 ^ from this time
59490 ^ i am telling
59491 ^ you

59500 ^ i
59501 ^ am [he].
59502 ^ truly,
59503 ^ truly,
59504 ^ i say
59505 ^ to you,
59506 ^ the [one] receiving

59515 ^ me
59516 ^ receiving,
59517 ^ receives
59518 ^ the [one] having sent
59520 ^ me.
59521 ^ these things

59526 ^ - in spirit,
59528 ^ and
59529 ^ he testified
59530 ^ and

59579 ^ having leaned
59580 ^ then
59581 ^ he
59582 ^ thus
59583 ^ on the breast
59586 ^ - of jesus,
59588 ^ he says
59589 ^ to him,
59590 ^ lord,
59591 ^ who

59605 ^ him.
59606 ^ having dipped
59607 ^ then
59608 ^ the morsel,
59610 ^ he takes [it]

59644 ^ to him.
59645 ^ some
59646 ^ for

60801 ^ me.
60802 ^ if

60804 ^ i had come
60805 ^ and
60806 ^ spoken
60807 ^ to them,

60816 ^ for the sin of them.
60820 ^ the [one]

60823 ^ also
60824 ^ the father of me

60828 ^ if
60829 ^ the works
60831 ^ not
60832 ^ i had done
60833 ^ among them
60835 ^ that
60836 ^ no other
60838 ^ has done,
60839 ^ sin
60840 ^ not
60841 ^ they would have had;
60842 ^ now
60843 ^ however
60844 ^ both
60845 ^ they have seen
60846 ^ and
60847 ^ have hated
60848 ^ both me
60850 ^ and the father of me.
60854 ^ but [this is]
60855 ^ that
60856 ^ may be fulfilled
60857 ^ the word
60859 ^ -
60860 ^ in the law of them
60864 ^ having been written
60865 ^ -:
60866 ^ they hated
60867 ^ me

60869 ^ when
60870 ^ comes
60871 ^ the helper,
60873 ^ whom
60874 ^ i
60875 ^ will send
60876 ^ to you

60882 ^ - of truth,
60884 ^ who
60885 ^ from the father
60888 ^ goes forth,
60889 ^ he
60890 ^ will bear witness
60891 ^ concerning me.
60893 ^ also
60894 ^ you
60895 ^ now
60896 ^ bear witness,
60897 ^ because
60898 ^ from [the] beginning
60900 ^ with me
60902 ^ you are.
60903 ^ these things
60904 ^ i have spoken
60905 ^ to you
60906 ^ that
60907 ^ not
60908 ^ you might fall away.
60909 ^ out of the synagogues
60910 ^ they will put
60911 ^ you;
60912 ^ but
60913 ^ is coming
60914 ^ an hour
60915 ^ that
60916 ^ everyone - having killed
60919 ^ you
60920 ^ will think
60921 ^ [it is] a service
60922 ^ to offer
60923 ^ - to god.
60925 ^ and
60926 ^ these things
60927 ^ they will do,
60928 ^ because
60929 ^ not
60930 ^ they know
60931 ^ the father,
60933 ^ nor me.
60935 ^ but
60936 ^ these things
60937 ^ i have said
60938 ^ to you,
60939 ^ so that
60940 ^ when
60941 ^ might have come
60942 ^ the hour of them,
60945 ^ you may remember
60946 ^ them,
60947 ^ that
60948 ^ i
60949 ^ said [them]
60950 ^ to you.
60951 ^ these things
60952 ^ now
60953 ^ to you
60954 ^ from [the] beginning
60956 ^ not
60957 ^ i said,
60958 ^ because
60959 ^ with you
60961 ^ i was.
60962 ^ now
60963 ^ however
60964 ^ i go
60965 ^ to the [one] having sent
60968 ^ me,
60969 ^ and
60970 ^ none
60971 ^ of you

60974 ^ me,
60975 ^ where

60981 ^ to you,
60982 ^ - sorrow

60989 ^ i
60990 ^ the truth

60993 ^ to you,
60994 ^ it is profitable
60995 ^ for you
60996 ^ that
60997 ^ i
60998 ^ should go away.
60999 ^ if
61000 ^ for
61001 ^ not
61002 ^ i go away,
61003 ^ the helper
61005 ^ no
61006 ^ will come
61007 ^ to you;
61009 ^ if

61018 ^ he
61019 ^ will convict
61020 ^ the world
61022 ^ concerning sin,
61024 ^ and concerning righteousness,
61027 ^ and concerning judgment:
61030 ^ concerning sin
61032 ^ indeed,
61033 ^ because
61034 ^ not
61035 ^ do they believe
61036 ^ in me;
61038 ^ concerning righteousness
61040 ^ now,
61041 ^ because
61042 ^ to the father
61045 ^ i go away,
61046 ^ and
61047 ^ no more
61048 ^ you behold
61049 ^ me;
61050 ^ concerning
61051 ^ now

61079 ^ you
61080 ^ into the truth all;
61084 ^ not
61085 ^ for
61086 ^ he will speak
61087 ^ from himself,
61089 ^ but
61090 ^ whatever
61091 ^ he may hear,
61092 ^ he will speak;
61093 ^ and
61094 ^ the things coming
61096 ^ he will declare
61097 ^ to you.

64259 ^ also
64260 ^ we
64261 ^ with you.
64263 ^ they went forth
64264 ^ and

64266 ^ into the boat,
64269 ^ and
64270 ^ during that - night
64274 ^ they caught
64275 ^ nothing.
64276 ^ morning
64277 ^ now
64278 ^ already
64279 ^ having come,
64280 ^ stood

64327 ^ were they able,
64328 ^ from the multitude
64331 ^ of the fish.

64335 ^ the disciple
64337 ^ that
64338 ^ whom
64339 ^ loved
64340 ^ - jesus
64342 ^ - to peter,
64344 ^ the lord

64377 ^ far
64378 ^ from the land,
64381 ^ but
64382 ^ about away cubits two hundred,
64386 ^ dragging
64387 ^ the net
64389 ^ with the fish.
64391 ^ when
64392 ^ therefore
64393 ^ they got out
64394 ^ onto the land,
64397 ^ they see
64398 ^ a fire of coals
64399 ^ lying,
64400 ^ and fish
64402 ^ lying on [it],

64448 ^ dared
64449 ^ of the disciples
64451 ^ to ask
64452 ^ him,
64453 ^ you
64454 ^ who

64532 ^ to him,
64533 ^ shepherd
64534 ^ the sheep of me.
64537 ^ he says
64538 ^ to him
64539 ^ the third time,
64541 ^ simon [son] of john,
64543 ^ do you dearly love
64544 ^ me?
64545 ^ was grieved
64546 ^ - peter
64548 ^ because
64549 ^ he said
64550 ^ to him
64551 ^ the third time,
64553 ^ do you dearly love
64554 ^ me?
64555 ^ and
64556 ^ he said
64557 ^ to him,
64558 ^ lord,

64572 ^ the sheep of me.
64575 ^ truly,
64576 ^ truly,
64577 ^ i say
64578 ^ to you,
64579 ^ when
64580 ^ you were
64581 ^ younger,
64582 ^ you dressed
64583 ^ yourself
64584 ^ and
64585 ^ walked
64586 ^ where
64587 ^ you desired;
64588 ^ when
64589 ^ however
64590 ^ you shall be old,
64591 ^ you will stretch forth
64592 ^ the hands of you,
64595 ^ and
64596 ^ another
64597 ^ you
64598 ^ will dress
64599 ^ and
64600 ^ will bring [you]
64601 ^ where
64602 ^ not
64603 ^ you do desire.
64604 ^ this
64605 ^ now
64606 ^ he said
64607 ^ signifying
64608 ^ by what death
64610 ^ he will glorify
64611 ^ - god.
64613 ^ and
64614 ^ this
64615 ^ having said,
64616 ^ he says
64617 ^ to him,
64618 ^ follow
64619 ^ me.
64620 ^ having turned,
64621 ^ - peter

64631 ^ who
64632 ^ also
64633 ^ had reclined
64634 ^ at the supper
64637 ^ on the bosom of him,
64641 ^ and
64642 ^ said,
64643 ^ lord,
64644 ^ who
64645 ^ is it
64646 ^ who is betraying
64648 ^ you?
64649 ^ him
64650 ^ therefore
64651 ^ having seen,
64652 ^ - peter
64654 ^ says
64655 ^ - to jesus,
64657 ^ lord,
64658 ^ this man
64659 ^ and
64660 ^ what about?
64661 ^ says
64662 ^ to him
64663 ^ - jesus,
64665 ^ if
64666 ^ him
64667 ^ i desire
64668 ^ to remain
64669 ^ until

64671 ^ what [is it]
64672 ^ to you?
64674 ^ you
64675 ^ me
64676 ^ follow!
64677 ^ went out
64678 ^ therefore
64679 ^ this - saying
64682 ^ among the brothers,
64685 ^ that
64686 ^ the disciple that,
64689 ^ not
64690 ^ dies.
64691 ^ not
64692 ^ said
64693 ^ however
64694 ^ to him
64695 ^ - jesus
64697 ^ that
64698 ^ not
64699 ^ he dies,
64700 ^ but,
64701 ^ if
64702 ^ him
64703 ^ i desire
64704 ^ to remain
64705 ^ until
64706 ^ i come,
64707 ^ what [is it]
64708 ^ to you?
64710 ^ this
64711 ^ is
64712 ^ the disciple
64714 ^ - bearing witness
64716 ^ concerning these things,
64718 ^ and
64719 ^ the [one] having written
64721 ^ these things,
64722 ^ and
64723 ^ we know
64724 ^ that
64725 ^ true
64726 ^ of him the testimony
64729 ^ is.
64730 ^ there are
64731 ^ now
64732 ^ also
64733 ^ other things
64734 ^ many
64735 ^ that
64736 ^ did
64737 ^ - jesus,
64739 ^ which
64740 ^ if
64741 ^ they should be written
64742 ^ every one,
64744 ^ not even
64745 ^ itself
64746 ^ i suppose
64747 ^ the world
64749 ^ to have space
64750 ^ for the
64751 ^ to be written books.
64753 ^ the
64754 ^ indeed
64755 ^ first account
64757 ^ i composed
64758 ^ concerning all the things,
64760 ^ o theophilus,
64762 ^ which
64763 ^ began
64764 ^ - jesus
64766 ^ to do
64767 ^ both
64768 ^ and
64769 ^ to teach,
64770 ^ until the day,
64773 ^ having given orders
64774 ^ to the apostles
64776 ^ by [the] spirit holy
64779 ^ whom
64780 ^ he had chosen,
64781 ^ he was taken up,
64782 ^ to whom
64783 ^ also
64784 ^ he presented
64785 ^ himself
64786 ^ alive
64787 ^ after the suffering
64790 ^ of him
64791 ^ with many proofs,
64794 ^ during days forty
64797 ^ being seen
64798 ^ by them
64799 ^ and
64800 ^ speaking
64801 ^ the things
64802 ^ concerning the kingdom
64805 ^ - of god.
64807 ^ and
64808 ^ being assembled together,
64809 ^ he instructed
64810 ^ them
64811 ^ from jerusalem
64813 ^ not
64814 ^ to depart,
64815 ^ but
64816 ^ to await
64817 ^ the promise
64819 ^ of the father:
64821 ^ that which
64822 ^ you heard
64823 ^ of me;
64824 ^ for
64825 ^ john
64826 ^ indeed
64827 ^ baptized
64828 ^ with water;
64829 ^ you
64830 ^ however
64831 ^ with [the] spirit
64833 ^ will be baptized
64834 ^ holy,
64835 ^ not after
64837 ^ many these days.
64840 ^ those
64841 ^ indeed
64842 ^ therefore
64843 ^ having come together,
64844 ^ were asking
64845 ^ him,
64846 ^ saying,
64847 ^ lord,
64848 ^ if
64849 ^ at the time this,
64853 ^ are you restoring
64854 ^ the kingdom
64856 ^ - to israel?
64858 ^ he said
64859 ^ then
64860 ^ to them,
64862 ^ not
64863 ^ yours
64864 ^ it is
64865 ^ to know
64866 ^ times
64867 ^ or seasons
64869 ^ which
64870 ^ the father
64872 ^ put in place
64873 ^ by - his own authority.
64877 ^ but
64878 ^ you will receive
64879 ^ power,
64880 ^ having come
64881 ^ the holy spirit
64884 ^ upon you,
64886 ^ and
64887 ^ you will be
64888 ^ for me witnesses,
64890 ^ in both jerusalem,
64893 ^ and in all - judea,
64898 ^ and samaria,
64900 ^ and to [the] uttermost part
64903 ^ of the earth.
64905 ^ and
64906 ^ these things
64907 ^ having said,
64908 ^ beholding
64909 ^ they,
64910 ^ he was taken up,
64911 ^ and
64912 ^ a cloud
64913 ^ hid
64914 ^ him
64915 ^ from the eyes of them.
64919 ^ and
64920 ^ as
64921 ^ looking intently
64922 ^ they were
64923 ^ into the heaven
64926 ^ as was going
64927 ^ he,
64928 ^ then
64929 ^ behold
64930 ^ men two
64932 ^ stood by
64933 ^ them
64934 ^ in apparel white,
64937 ^ who
64938 ^ also
64939 ^ said,
64940 ^ men,
64941 ^ galileans,
64942 ^ why
64943 ^ do you stand
64944 ^ looking
64945 ^ into - heaven?
64948 ^ this - jesus,
64951 ^ - having been taken up
64953 ^ from you
64955 ^ into - heaven,
64958 ^ thus
64959 ^ will come
64960 ^ in that manner
64962 ^ you beheld
64963 ^ him
64964 ^ going
64965 ^ into - heaven.
64968 ^ then
64969 ^ they returned
64970 ^ to jerusalem
64972 ^ from [the] mount
64974 ^ - called
64976 ^ olivet,
64977 ^ which
64978 ^ is
64979 ^ near jerusalem,
64981 ^ a sabbath day’s
64982 ^ holding
64983 ^ journey.
64984 ^ and
64985 ^ when
64986 ^ they had entered
64987 ^ into the upper room,
64990 ^ they went up
64991 ^ where
64992 ^ they were
64993 ^ staying,
64994 ^ - both peter
64997 ^ and john,
64999 ^ and james
65001 ^ and andrew,
65003 ^ philip
65004 ^ and thomas,
65006 ^ bartholomew
65007 ^ and matthew,
65009 ^ james [son] of alphaeus,
65011 ^ and simon
65013 ^ the zealot,
65015 ^ and judas [son] of james.
65018 ^ these all
65020 ^ were
65021 ^ steadfastly continuing
65022 ^ with one accord
65023 ^ - in prayer,
65025 ^ with [the] women,
65027 ^ and mary
65029 ^ the mother
65031 ^ - of jesus,
65033 ^ and the brothers of him.
65037 ^ and
65038 ^ in the days these,
65042 ^ having stood up
65043 ^ peter
65044 ^ in [the] midst
65046 ^ of the brothers,
65048 ^ he said —
65049 ^ was
65050 ^ then
65051 ^ [the] number of names
65053 ^ together the same
65056 ^ about a hundred twenty —
65059 ^ men, brothers,
65061 ^ it was necessary for
65062 ^ to have been fulfilled
65063 ^ the scripture
65065 ^ which
65066 ^ spoke beforehand
65067 ^ the spirit
65069 ^ - holy
65071 ^ by [the] mouth of david
65074 ^ concerning judas,
65076 ^ the [one] having become
65078 ^ guide
65079 ^ to those having arrested
65081 ^ jesus;
65082 ^ for
65083 ^ numbered
65084 ^ he was
65085 ^ with us,
65087 ^ and
65088 ^ was allotted
65089 ^ - a share
65091 ^ of the ministry this.
65094 ^ this [man]
65095 ^ indeed
65096 ^ then
65097 ^ acquired
65098 ^ a field
65099 ^ out of [the] reward
65101 ^ - of unrighteousness,
65103 ^ and
65104 ^ headlong
65105 ^ having fallen,
65106 ^ he burst open
65107 ^ in [the] middle,
65108 ^ and
65109 ^ gushed out
65110 ^ all the intestines of him.
65114 ^ and
65115 ^ known
65116 ^ it became
65117 ^ to all those dwelling
65120 ^ in jerusalem,
65121 ^ so that
65122 ^ was called
65123 ^ the field that
65126 ^ in the own language of them
65130 ^ akeldama,
65131 ^ that
65132 ^ is,
65133 ^ field of blood.
65135 ^ it has been written

66171 ^ from them
66173 ^ to receive.
66174 ^ said

66176 ^ peter,
66177 ^ silver
66178 ^ and gold
66180 ^ none
66181 ^ there is
66182 ^ to me;

66199 ^ and

66209 ^ were strengthened
66210 ^ the feet of him,
66213 ^ and the ankles.
66216 ^ and
66217 ^ leaping up,
66218 ^ he stood
66219 ^ and
66220 ^ began walking,
66221 ^ and
66222 ^ he entered
66223 ^ with them
66225 ^ into the temple,

66293 ^ having seen [it]
66294 ^ however,
66295 ^ - peter
66297 ^ answered
66298 ^ to the people:
66301 ^ men,
66302 ^ israelites,
66303 ^ why
66304 ^ wonder you
66305 ^ at this?
66307 ^ or
66308 ^ on us
66309 ^ why
66310 ^ you look intently,
66311 ^ as if
66312 ^ by [our] own power
66314 ^ or godliness
66316 ^ [we] have made
66317 ^ - to walk
66319 ^ him?
66320 ^ the god of abraham,
66323 ^ and the god of isaac,

66331 ^ the god
66333 ^ of the fathers of us,
66336 ^ has glorified
66337 ^ the servant of him, jesus,
66341 ^ whom
66342 ^ you
66343 ^ indeed
66344 ^ betrayed
66345 ^ and
66346 ^ disowned
66347 ^ in [the] presence of pilate,
66350 ^ having adjudged
66351 ^ that one
66352 ^ to release [him].
66353 ^ you
66354 ^ however
66355 ^ the holy
66357 ^ and righteous one
66359 ^ denied,
66360 ^ and
66361 ^ requested
66362 ^ a man, a murderer,
66364 ^ to be granted
66365 ^ to you;
66366 ^ -
66367 ^ and
66368 ^ the author
66369 ^ - of life
66371 ^ you killed,
66372 ^ whom
66373 ^ - god
66375 ^ has raised up
66376 ^ out from [the] dead,
66378 ^ whereof
66379 ^ we
66380 ^ witnesses
66381 ^ are.
66382 ^ and

66389 ^ this [man]

66402 ^ through him
66404 ^ has given
66405 ^ to him
66406 ^ the complete soundness this
66409 ^ before all of you.
66412 ^ and

66414 ^ brothers,
66415 ^ i know
66416 ^ that
66417 ^ in ignorance
66419 ^ you acted,
66420 ^ as
66421 ^ also
66422 ^ the rulers of you.
66425 ^ -
66426 ^ but
66427 ^ god
66428 ^ what

66557 ^ - god
66559 ^ with the fathers of you,
66563 ^ saying
66564 ^ to abraham,
66566 ^ and
66567 ^ in the seed of you
66571 ^ will be blessed
66572 ^ all the families

66577 ^ to you
66578 ^ first,
66579 ^ having raised up
66580 ^ - god
66582 ^ the servant of him,
66585 ^ sent
66586 ^ him,
66587 ^ blessing
66588 ^ you

66599 ^ of them
66600 ^ to the people,
66603 ^ came
66604 ^ upon them
66605 ^ the priests
66607 ^ and the captain
66610 ^ of the temple
66612 ^ and the sadducees,

66620 ^ the people
66622 ^ and

66624 ^ in - jesus
66627 ^ the resurrection
66629 ^ -
66630 ^ out from [the] dead;
66632 ^ and
66633 ^ they laid
66634 ^ on them
66635 ^ the hands
66637 ^ and
66638 ^ put [them]
66639 ^ in custody
66641 ^ until the next day;
66644 ^ it was
66645 ^ for
66646 ^ evening
66647 ^ already.
66648 ^ many
66649 ^ however
66650 ^ of those having heard
66652 ^ the word
66654 ^ believed,
66655 ^ and
66656 ^ became
66657 ^ the number
66659 ^ of the men
66661 ^ about thousand five.
66664 ^ it came to pass
66665 ^ then
66666 ^ on the next day

66697 ^ and
66698 ^ having placed
66699 ^ them
66700 ^ in the midst,
66703 ^ they began to inquire,

66707 ^ or in what name
66711 ^ did
66712 ^ this
66713 ^ you?
66714 ^ then
66715 ^ peter,

66748 ^ that
66749 ^ in the name
66752 ^ of jesus
66753 ^ christ
66754 ^ of nazareth,
66756 ^ whom
66757 ^ you
66758 ^ crucified,
66759 ^ whom

66772 ^ this
66773 ^ is
66774 ^ the stone
66776 ^ - having been rejected

66807 ^ by which
66809 ^ it behooves
66810 ^ to be saved
66811 ^ us.
66812 ^ seeing
66813 ^ now
66814 ^ the
66815 ^ - of peter boldness,
66818 ^ and of john,
66820 ^ and
66821 ^ having understood
66822 ^ that
66823 ^ men unschooled
66825 ^ they are,
66826 ^ and ordinary,
66828 ^ they were astonished.
66829 ^ they recognized
66830 ^ then
66831 ^ them,
66832 ^ that
66833 ^ with - jesus
66836 ^ they had been.
66837 ^ -
66838 ^ and
66839 ^ the man
66840 ^ beholding
66841 ^ with them
66843 ^ standing
66844 ^ - having been healed,
66846 ^ nothing
66847 ^ they had
66848 ^ to contradict.

66850 ^ however
66851 ^ them
66852 ^ outside
66853 ^ the council
66855 ^ to go,
66856 ^ they began to confer
66857 ^ with one another,
66859 ^ saying,
66860 ^ what
66861 ^ shall we do
66862 ^ to the men these?
66865 ^ that
66866 ^ truly
66867 ^ for
66868 ^ a noteworthy sign

66882 ^ but
66883 ^ that
66884 ^ not
66885 ^ on further
66887 ^ it might spread
66888 ^ among the people,
66891 ^ let us warn
66892 ^ them
66893 ^ no longer
66894 ^ to speak
66895 ^ in the name this
66899 ^ to no man.
66901 ^ and
66902 ^ having called

66940 ^ for
66941 ^ we,
66942 ^ what
66943 ^ we have seen

66955 ^ the
66956 ^ how
66957 ^ they might punish
66958 ^ them,

67002 ^ -
67003 ^ and
67004 ^ having heard,
67005 ^ with one accord
67006 ^ they lifted up
67007 ^ [their] voice
67008 ^ to - god
67011 ^ and
67012 ^ said,

67320 ^ because of why

67343 ^ to you

67346 ^ having been sold,
67347 ^ in the own authority
67351 ^ it was?
67352 ^ why

67381 ^ upon all those hearing.
67385 ^ having arisen
67386 ^ then,
67387 ^ the younger [men]

67434 ^ you
67435 ^ to test

67519 ^ but
67520 ^ were magnifying
67521 ^ them
67522 ^ the people;
67524 ^ more
67525 ^ now
67526 ^ were added
67527 ^ believing
67528 ^ in the lord,
67530 ^ multitudes
67531 ^ of men both,
67533 ^ and women,
67535 ^ so as
67536 ^ even
67537 ^ into the streets
67540 ^ to bring out
67541 ^ the sick,
67543 ^ and
67544 ^ to put [them]
67545 ^ on cots
67547 ^ and mats,
67549 ^ that
67550 ^ coming
67551 ^ of peter,
67552 ^ at least
67553 ^ the shadow

67556 ^ some of them.
67558 ^ were coming together
67559 ^ now
67560 ^ also
67561 ^ the multitude
67563 ^ from the
67564 ^ surrounding cities

67567 ^ bringing
67568 ^ [the] sick
67569 ^ and [those] being tormented
67571 ^ by spirits unclean,
67574 ^ who
67575 ^ were healed
67576 ^ all.
67577 ^ having risen up
67578 ^ however
67579 ^ the high priest
67581 ^ and all those
67584 ^ with him,
67586 ^ - being
67588 ^ the sect
67589 ^ of the sadducees,
67591 ^ were filled
67592 ^ with jealousy,
67593 ^ and
67594 ^ they laid
67595 ^ the hands
67597 ^ on the apostles
67600 ^ and
67601 ^ put
67602 ^ them
67603 ^ in [the] jail public.
67606 ^ an angel
67607 ^ however
67608 ^ of [the] lord,
67609 ^ during the night
67611 ^ having opened
67612 ^ the doors
67614 ^ of the prison,
67616 ^ having brought out
67617 ^ then
67618 ^ them,
67619 ^ said,
67620 ^ go,
67621 ^ and
67622 ^ having stood,
67623 ^ speak
67624 ^ in the temple
67627 ^ to the people
67629 ^ all the words
67632 ^ of the life this.
67635 ^ having heard
67636 ^ now,
67637 ^ they entered
67638 ^ at the dawn
67641 ^ into the temple
67644 ^ and
67645 ^ were teaching.
67646 ^ having come
67647 ^ now
67648 ^ the high priest
67650 ^ and those
67652 ^ with him,
67654 ^ they called together
67655 ^ the council,
67657 ^ even all the senate
67661 ^ of the sons of israel,
67664 ^ and
67665 ^ sent
67666 ^ to the prison house
67669 ^ to bring
67670 ^ them.
67671 ^ -
67672 ^ and
67673 ^ having come, [the] officers
67675 ^ not
67676 ^ did find
67677 ^ them
67678 ^ in the prison;
67681 ^ having returned
67682 ^ then
67683 ^ they reported back,
67684 ^ saying
67685 ^ -,
67686 ^ the prison house
67688 ^ we found
67689 ^ shut,
67690 ^ with all security,
67693 ^ and the guards
67696 ^ standing
67697 ^ before the doors;
67700 ^ having opened [them]
67701 ^ however,
67702 ^ inside
67703 ^ no one
67704 ^ we found.
67705 ^ when
67706 ^ now
67707 ^ they heard
67708 ^ the words these,
67711 ^ -
67712 ^ both
67713 ^ the captain
67714 ^ of the temple
67716 ^ and the chief priests
67719 ^ were perplexed
67720 ^ concerning them,
67722 ^ what
67723 ^ -
67724 ^ might be
67725 ^ this.
67726 ^ having come
67727 ^ then,
67728 ^ a certain one
67729 ^ reported
67730 ^ to them
67731 ^ -,
67732 ^ behold,
67733 ^ the men
67735 ^ whom
67736 ^ you put
67737 ^ in the prison
67740 ^ are
67741 ^ in the temple,
67744 ^ standing
67745 ^ and
67746 ^ teaching
67747 ^ the people!
67749 ^ then
67750 ^ having gone,
67751 ^ the captain
67753 ^ with the officers
67756 ^ was bringing
67757 ^ them,
67758 ^ not
67759 ^ with force;
67761 ^ they were afraid of
67762 ^ for
67763 ^ the people
67765 ^ lest
67766 ^ they might be stoned.
67767 ^ having brought
67768 ^ then
67769 ^ them,
67770 ^ they set [them]
67771 ^ in the council.
67774 ^ and
67775 ^ asked
67776 ^ them
67777 ^ the high priest,
67779 ^ saying,
67780 ^ not
67781 ^ by a charge
67782 ^ we commanded
67783 ^ you
67784 ^ not
67785 ^ to teach
67786 ^ in the name this?
67790 ^ and
67791 ^ behold,
67792 ^ you have filled
67793 ^ - jerusalem
67795 ^ with the teaching of you,
67798 ^ and
67799 ^ you intend
67800 ^ to bring
67801 ^ upon us
67803 ^ the blood
67805 ^ of the man this.
67808 ^ answering
67809 ^ however,
67810 ^ peter
67811 ^ and the apostles
67814 ^ said,
67815 ^ to obey
67816 ^ it is necessary
67817 ^ god,
67818 ^ rather than men.
67821 ^ the god
67823 ^ of the fathers of us
67826 ^ raised up
67827 ^ jesus,
67828 ^ whom
67829 ^ you
67830 ^ killed,
67831 ^ having hanged [him]
67832 ^ on a tree.
67834 ^ him
67835 ^ - god
67837 ^ [as] prince
67838 ^ and savior
67840 ^ exalted
67841 ^ by the right hand of him,
67844 ^ - to give
67846 ^ repentance
67847 ^ - to israel
67849 ^ and forgiveness of sins.
67852 ^ and
67853 ^ we
67854 ^ are
67855 ^ witnesses
67856 ^ of the things these,
67859 ^ and also
67860 ^ the spirit
67862 ^ - holy,
67864 ^ whom
67865 ^ has given
67866 ^ - god
67868 ^ to those obeying
67870 ^ him.
67871 ^ -
67872 ^ and
67873 ^ having heard,
67874 ^ they were cut [to the heart]
67875 ^ and
67876 ^ were desiring
67877 ^ to put to death
67878 ^ them.
67879 ^ having risen up
67880 ^ however
67881 ^ a certain [man]
67882 ^ in the council, a pharisee
67886 ^ named gamaliel,
67888 ^ a teacher of the law
67889 ^ honored
67890 ^ by all the people,
67893 ^ he commanded [them]
67894 ^ outside
67895 ^ for a short while
67896 ^ the men
67898 ^ to put.
67899 ^ he said
67900 ^ then
67901 ^ to them,
67903 ^ men,
67904 ^ israelites,
67905 ^ take heed
67906 ^ to yourselves
67907 ^ with the men these,
67911 ^ what
67912 ^ you are about
67913 ^ to do.
67914 ^ before
67915 ^ for
67916 ^ these - days
67919 ^ rose up
67920 ^ theudas,
67921 ^ affirming
67922 ^ to be
67923 ^ somebody
67924 ^ himself,
67925 ^ to whom
67926 ^ were joined
67927 ^ of men number
67929 ^ about four hundred,
67931 ^ who
67932 ^ was put to death,
67933 ^ and
67934 ^ all,
67935 ^ as many as
67936 ^ were persuaded
67937 ^ by him,
67938 ^ were dispersed,
67939 ^ and
67940 ^ it came
67941 ^ to nothing.
67943 ^ after this man
67945 ^ rose up
67946 ^ judas
67947 ^ the galilean
67949 ^ in the days
67952 ^ of the registration
67954 ^ and
67955 ^ drew away
67956 ^ people
67957 ^ after him.
67959 ^ and he
67960 ^ perished,
67961 ^ and
67962 ^ all
67963 ^ as many as
67964 ^ were persuaded
67965 ^ by him,
67966 ^ were scattered.
67967 ^ and
67968 ^ - now
67970 ^ i say
67971 ^ to you,
67972 ^ withdraw
67973 ^ from the men these,
67977 ^ and
67978 ^ let alone
67979 ^ them,
67980 ^ for
67981 ^ if
67982 ^ be
67983 ^ from men,
67985 ^ the plan this
67988 ^ or the work this,
67992 ^ it will be overthrown;
67993 ^ if
67994 ^ however
67995 ^ from god
67997 ^ it is,
67998 ^ not
67999 ^ you will be able
68000 ^ to overthrow
68001 ^ them,
68002 ^ lest ever
68003 ^ also
68004 ^ fighting against god
68005 ^ you would be found.
68006 ^ they were persuaded
68007 ^ now
68008 ^ by him;
68009 ^ and
68010 ^ having called in
68011 ^ the apostles,
68013 ^ having beaten,
68014 ^ they commanded [them]
68015 ^ not
68016 ^ to speak
68017 ^ in the name
68020 ^ - of jesus,
68022 ^ and
68023 ^ released [them].
68024 ^ they
68025 ^ indeed
68026 ^ therefore
68027 ^ departed,
68028 ^ rejoicing,
68029 ^ from [the] presence
68031 ^ of the council,
68033 ^ that
68034 ^ they had been counted worthy
68035 ^ for the name
68038 ^ to suffer dishonor.
68039 ^ every
68040 ^ then
68041 ^ day,
68042 ^ in the temple
68045 ^ and in house,
68048 ^ not
68049 ^ they ceased
68050 ^ teaching
68051 ^ and
68052 ^ proclaiming the good news that
68053 ^ the christ
68055 ^ [is] jesus.
68056 ^ in
68057 ^ now
68058 ^ the days these,
68061 ^ [as] are multiplying
68062 ^ the disciples,
68064 ^ there arose
68065 ^ a grumbling
68066 ^ of the hellenists
68068 ^ against the hebrews,
68071 ^ because
68072 ^ were being overlooked
68073 ^ in the distribution
68076 ^ - daily
68078 ^ the widows of them.
68081 ^ having called near
68082 ^ then
68083 ^ the twelve
68085 ^ the multitude
68087 ^ of the disciples,
68089 ^ they said,
68090 ^ not
68091 ^ desirable
68092 ^ it is [for]
68093 ^ us,
68094 ^ having neglected
68095 ^ the word
68097 ^ - of god,
68099 ^ to attend
68100 ^ tables.
68101 ^ select
68102 ^ therefore,
68103 ^ brothers,
68104 ^ men
68105 ^ out from yourselves
68107 ^ being well attested, seven
68109 ^ full
68110 ^ of [the] spirit
68111 ^ and wisdom,
68113 ^ whom
68114 ^ we will appoint
68115 ^ over the task this.
68119 ^ we
68120 ^ now
68121 ^ in the prayer
68123 ^ and the ministry
68126 ^ of the word
68128 ^ will steadfastly continue.
68129 ^ and
68130 ^ was pleasing
68131 ^ the statement
68133 ^ before all the multitude;
68137 ^ and
68138 ^ they chose
68139 ^ stephen,
68140 ^ a man
68141 ^ full
68142 ^ of faith
68143 ^ and [of the] spirit holy,
68146 ^ and philip,
68148 ^ and prochorus,
68150 ^ and nicanor,
68152 ^ and timon,
68154 ^ and parmenas,
68156 ^ and nicolas
68158 ^ a convert of antioch,
68160 ^ whom
68161 ^ they set
68162 ^ before the apostles;
68165 ^ and
68166 ^ having prayed,
68167 ^ they laid
68168 ^ on them
68169 ^ the hands.
68171 ^ and
68172 ^ the word
68174 ^ - of god
68176 ^ continued to increase,
68177 ^ and
68178 ^ was multiplied
68179 ^ the number
68181 ^ of the disciples
68183 ^ in jerusalem
68185 ^ exceedingly;
68186 ^ a great
68187 ^ then
68188 ^ multitude
68189 ^ of the priests
68191 ^ were becoming obedient
68192 ^ to the faith.
68194 ^ stephen
68195 ^ now,
68196 ^ full
68197 ^ grace
68198 ^ and power,
68200 ^ was performing
68201 ^ wonders
68202 ^ and signs great
68205 ^ among the people.
68208 ^ arose
68209 ^ however
68210 ^ certain
68211 ^ of those
68212 ^ from the synagogue
68215 ^ - called
68217 ^ freedmen, including cyrenians
68220 ^ and alexandrians
68222 ^ and of those
68224 ^ from cilicia
68226 ^ and asia,
68228 ^ disputing
68229 ^ with stephen.
68231 ^ and
68232 ^ not
68233 ^ they were able
68234 ^ to withstand
68235 ^ the wisdom
68237 ^ and the spirit
68240 ^ by whom
68241 ^ he was speaking.
68242 ^ then
68243 ^ they suborned
68244 ^ men,
68245 ^ saying
68246 ^ -,
68247 ^ we have heard
68248 ^ him
68249 ^ speaking
68250 ^ words blasphemous
68252 ^ against moses
68254 ^ and - god.
68257 ^ they stirred up
68258 ^ then
68259 ^ the people
68261 ^ and the elders
68264 ^ and the scribes,
68267 ^ and
68268 ^ having come upon [him],
68269 ^ they seized
68270 ^ him
68271 ^ and
68272 ^ brought [him]
68273 ^ to the council.
68276 ^ they set
68277 ^ also
68278 ^ witnesses
68279 ^ false,
68280 ^ saying,
68281 ^ the man this,
68284 ^ not
68285 ^ does stop
68286 ^ speaking
68287 ^ words
68288 ^ against the place
68291 ^ - holy this
68294 ^ and the law;
68297 ^ we have heard
68298 ^ for
68299 ^ him
68300 ^ saying
68301 ^ that
68302 ^ jesus
68303 ^ of nazareth this
68306 ^ will destroy
68307 ^ the place this
68310 ^ and
68311 ^ will change
68312 ^ the customs
68314 ^ that
68315 ^ delivered
68316 ^ to us
68317 ^ moses.
68318 ^ and
68319 ^ having looked intently
68320 ^ on him,
68322 ^ all - sitting
68325 ^ in the council
68328 ^ saw
68329 ^ the face of him
68332 ^ as [the] face of an angel.
68335 ^ said
68336 ^ then
68337 ^ the high priest,
68339 ^ if
68340 ^ these things
68341 ^ so
68342 ^ are?
68343 ^ -
68344 ^ and
68345 ^ he began to speak:

68347 ^ brothers,
68348 ^ and fathers,
68350 ^ listen!
68351 ^ the god
68353 ^ - of glory
68355 ^ appeared
68356 ^ to the father of us abraham,
68360 ^ being
68361 ^ in - mesopotamia,
68364 ^ before rather
68366 ^ dwelling
68367 ^ his
68368 ^ in haran,
68370 ^ and
68371 ^ he said
68372 ^ to him,

68375 ^ from the country of you
68379 ^ and from the kindred of you,
68384 ^ and

68386 ^ into the land
68389 ^ which
68390 ^ -
68391 ^ to you
68392 ^ i will show.’
68393 ^ then
68394 ^ having gone out
68395 ^ from [the] land of chaldeans,
68398 ^ he dwelt
68399 ^ in haran.
68401 ^ and from there,
68402 ^ after - died
68405 ^ the father of him,
68408 ^ he removed
68409 ^ him
68410 ^ into the land this,
68414 ^ in which
68416 ^ you
68417 ^ now
68418 ^ dwell.
68419 ^ and
68420 ^ not
68421 ^ he did give
68422 ^ to him
68423 ^ an inheritance
68424 ^ in it,
68426 ^ not even
68427 ^ [the] length of a foot;
68429 ^ but
68430 ^ he promised
68431 ^ to give
68432 ^ to him
68433 ^ for a possession
68435 ^ it,
68436 ^ and to the descendants of him
68440 ^ after him,
68442 ^ not
68443 ^ there being
68444 ^ to him
68445 ^ a child.
68446 ^ spoke
68447 ^ however
68448 ^ thus
68449 ^ - god
68451 ^ that
68452 ^ will be
68453 ^ the seed of him
68456 ^ a sojourner
68457 ^ in a land strange,
68460 ^ and
68461 ^ they will enslave
68462 ^ it,
68463 ^ and
68464 ^ will mistreat [it]
68465 ^ years four hundred.
68467 ^ and
68468 ^ the nation
68470 ^ to which
68471 ^ if
68472 ^ they will be in bondage,
68473 ^ will judge
68474 ^ i,
68475 ^ - god
68477 ^ said,
68478 ^ and
68479 ^ after these things
68481 ^ they will come forth
68482 ^ and
68483 ^ will serve
68484 ^ me
68485 ^ in the place this.’
68489 ^ and
68490 ^ he gave
68491 ^ to him
68492 ^ [the] covenant of circumcision;
68494 ^ and
68495 ^ thus
68496 ^ he begat
68497 ^ - isaac
68499 ^ and
68500 ^ circumcised
68501 ^ him
68502 ^ on the day

68506 ^ and
68507 ^ isaac
68508 ^ - jacob,
68510 ^ and

68524 ^ but
68525 ^ was
68526 ^ - god
68528 ^ with him,
68530 ^ and
68531 ^ rescued
68532 ^ him
68533 ^ out of all the tribulations of him,
68538 ^ and
68539 ^ gave
68540 ^ him
68541 ^ favor
68542 ^ and wisdom
68544 ^ before pharaoh,

68551 ^ ruler
68552 ^ over egypt,
68554 ^ and over all the house of him.
68560 ^ came
68561 ^ then
68562 ^ a famine
68563 ^ upon all - of egypt

68581 ^ jacob
68582 ^ [there] is grain
68584 ^ in egypt,
68586 ^ he sent forth

68590 ^ first;
68591 ^ and
68592 ^ on the second time,
68595 ^ was made known

68623 ^ seventy five.
68625 ^ and

68632 ^ he
68633 ^ and
68634 ^ the fathers of us,
68637 ^ and
68638 ^ they were carried over
68639 ^ into shechem
68641 ^ and
68642 ^ were placed
68643 ^ in the tomb
68646 ^ which
68647 ^ had bought
68648 ^ abraham
68649 ^ for a sum of silver
68651 ^ from the sons of hamor
68655 ^ in shechem.
68657 ^ as
68658 ^ now

68666 ^ - god
68668 ^ - to abraham,

68671 ^ the people
68673 ^ and
68674 ^ multiplied
68675 ^ in egypt,
68677 ^ until that
68679 ^ there arose
68680 ^ king another
68682 ^ over egypt,
68684 ^ who
68685 ^ not
68686 ^ knew
68687 ^ - joseph.
68689 ^ he
68690 ^ having dealt treacherously with
68691 ^ the race of us,
68694 ^ he mistreated
68695 ^ the fathers of us,
68698 ^ - making [them]

68706 ^ not
68707 ^ they would live.
68708 ^ in that time
68711 ^ was born
68712 ^ moses,
68713 ^ and
68714 ^ he was
68715 ^ beautiful
68716 ^ - to god,
68718 ^ who
68719 ^ was brought up
68720 ^ months three
68722 ^ in the house
68725 ^ of the father.
68727 ^ having been set outside
68728 ^ then
68729 ^ he,
68730 ^ took up
68731 ^ him
68732 ^ the daughter of pharaoh,
68735 ^ and
68736 ^ brought up
68737 ^ him
68738 ^ for herself
68739 ^ for a son.
68741 ^ and
68742 ^ was instructed
68743 ^ moses
68744 ^ in all [the] wisdom of [the] egyptians;
68748 ^ he was
68749 ^ now
68750 ^ mighty
68751 ^ in words
68753 ^ and deeds of him.
68756 ^ when
68757 ^ then
68758 ^ was fulfilled
68759 ^ to him
68760 ^ of forty years a period,
68762 ^ it came
68763 ^ into the mind of him
68767 ^ to visit
68768 ^ the brothers of him,
68771 ^ the sons of israel.
68774 ^ and
68775 ^ having seen
68776 ^ a certain one
68777 ^ being wronged,
68778 ^ he defended [him]
68779 ^ and
68780 ^ did
68781 ^ vengeance
68782 ^ for the [one] being oppressed,
68784 ^ having struck down
68785 ^ the egyptian.
68787 ^ he was supposing
68788 ^ now
68789 ^ to understand
68790 ^ the brothers of him
68793 ^ that
68794 ^ - god
68796 ^ by [the] hand of him
68799 ^ is giving
68800 ^ salvation
68801 ^ them,
68802 ^ -
68803 ^ but
68804 ^ not
68805 ^ they understood.
68806 ^ on the
68807 ^ and
68808 ^ following day,
68810 ^ he appeared
68811 ^ to those who
68812 ^ were quarreling
68813 ^ and
68814 ^ urged
68815 ^ them
68816 ^ to peace,
68818 ^ having said,
68819 ^ men,
68820 ^ brothers
68821 ^ you are.
68822 ^ so that why
68823 ^ wrong you
68824 ^ one another?
68825 ^ the [one]
68826 ^ however
68827 ^ mistreating
68828 ^ the neighbor
68830 ^ pushed away
68831 ^ him,
68832 ^ having said,
68833 ^ who
68834 ^ you
68835 ^ appointed,
68836 ^ ruler
68837 ^ and judge
68839 ^ over us?
68841 ^ not
68842 ^ to kill
68843 ^ me

68852 ^ fled
68853 ^ then
68854 ^ moses
68855 ^ at the remark this,
68859 ^ and
68860 ^ became
68861 ^ exiled
68862 ^ in [the] land of midian,

69726 ^ and
69727 ^ they received
69728 ^ [the] spirit holy.
69730 ^ having seen
69731 ^ now
69732 ^ - of simon
69734 ^ that
69735 ^ through the laying on
69738 ^ of the hands
69740 ^ of the apostles

69765 ^ said
69766 ^ to him,
69768 ^ the silver of you,
69771 ^ with you
69773 ^ may it be
69774 ^ to destruction,

69806 ^ therefore
69807 ^ of the wickedness of yours this,
69812 ^ and
69813 ^ pray earnestly to

69829 ^ and [the] bond of iniquity,
69832 ^ i see
69833 ^ you
69834 ^ being.
69835 ^ answering

69841 ^ you
69842 ^ on behalf of me
69844 ^ to the lord,
69847 ^ so that

69850 ^ upon me
69852 ^ of which
69853 ^ you have spoken.
69854 ^ they
69855 ^ indeed

69860 ^ the word
69862 ^ of the lord,
69864 ^ traveled back
69865 ^ to jerusalem,
69867 ^ to many
69868 ^ then
69869 ^ villages
69870 ^ of the samaritans
69872 ^ they were preaching the gospel.
69873 ^ an angel
69874 ^ now
69875 ^ of [the] lord
69876 ^ spoke
69877 ^ to philip,
69879 ^ saying,
69880 ^ rise up
69881 ^ and
69882 ^ go
69883 ^ toward [the] south,
69885 ^ to the road

69917 ^ had come
69918 ^ to worship
69919 ^ to jerusalem,
69921 ^ he was
69922 ^ then
69923 ^ returning
69924 ^ and

69948 ^ then,
69949 ^ - philip
69951 ^ heard
69952 ^ him
69953 ^ reading
69954 ^ isaiah
69955 ^ the prophet,

69962 ^ what
69963 ^ you are reading?
69964 ^ -
69965 ^ and
69966 ^ he said,

69976 ^ he invited
69977 ^ then
69978 ^ - philip,
69980 ^ having come up,
69981 ^ to sit
69982 ^ with him.
69984 ^ -
69985 ^ now
69986 ^ the passage

69989 ^ which
69990 ^ he was reading

69992 ^ this:
69993 ^ as a sheep
69995 ^ to slaughter
69997 ^ he was led,
69998 ^ and

70033 ^ answering
70034 ^ now,
70035 ^ the eunuch
70037 ^ - to philip
70039 ^ said,
70040 ^ i pray
70041 ^ you,
70042 ^ concerning whom
70044 ^ the prophet
70046 ^ says
70047 ^ this?

70056 ^ - philip
70058 ^ the mouth of him
70061 ^ and

70096 ^ and
70097 ^ they went down
70098 ^ both
70099 ^ to the water,
70102 ^ - both philip
70105 ^ and the eunuch,
70108 ^ and
70109 ^ he baptized
70110 ^ him.
70111 ^ when

72027 ^ then
72028 ^ the word
72030 ^ of the lord,

72033 ^ he had said,

72070 ^ then
72071 ^ these things,
72072 ^ they were silent
72073 ^ and
72074 ^ glorified
72075 ^ - god,
72077 ^ saying,
72078 ^ then indeed
72079 ^ also
72080 ^ to the gentiles
72082 ^ - god
72084 ^ - repentance
72086 ^ unto life
72088 ^ has given.
72089 ^ those

72098 ^ over stephen,

72122 ^ and of cyrene,
72124 ^ who
72125 ^ having come

72186 ^ with resolute purpose
72188 ^ - of heart
72190 ^ to abide

72196 ^ good,
72197 ^ and full
72199 ^ of [the] spirit holy,
72201 ^ and of faith.
72203 ^ and

72207 ^ to the lord.
72209 ^ he went forth
72210 ^ then

72213 ^ to seek
72214 ^ saul,
72215 ^ and

72222 ^ they
72223 ^ also
72224 ^ a year whole
72226 ^ gathered together

72250 ^ prophets
72251 ^ to antioch.
72253 ^ having risen up
72254 ^ now
72255 ^ one
72256 ^ of them
72258 ^ named agabus,
72260 ^ he signified
72261 ^ by the spirit [that]
72264 ^ a famine great
72266 ^ is about
72267 ^ to be
72268 ^ over all the world —
72272 ^ which
72273 ^ came to pass
72274 ^ under claudius.
72276 ^ -
72277 ^ and
72278 ^ the disciples,
72279 ^ as
72280 ^ was prospered
72281 ^ anyone,
72282 ^ determined
72283 ^ each of them,
72285 ^ for ministry,
72287 ^ to send
72288 ^ to the
72289 ^ dwelling
72290 ^ in - judea brothers,
72294 ^ which
72295 ^ also
72296 ^ they did,
72297 ^ having sent [it]
72298 ^ to the elders
72301 ^ by [the] hand
72303 ^ of barnabas
72304 ^ and saul.
72306 ^ at that
72308 ^ now
72309 ^ - time,
72311 ^ put forth
72312 ^ herod
72313 ^ the king
72315 ^ the hands
72317 ^ to mistreat
72318 ^ some
72319 ^ of those
72320 ^ of the church.
72323 ^ he put to death
72324 ^ then
72325 ^ james,
72326 ^ the brother of john,
72329 ^ with the sword.
72330 ^ having seen
72331 ^ now
72332 ^ that
72333 ^ pleasing
72334 ^ it is
72335 ^ to the jews,
72337 ^ he proceeded
72338 ^ to take
72339 ^ also
72340 ^ peter —
72341 ^ these were
72342 ^ now
72343 ^ the days
72345 ^ of the unleavened [bread] —
72347 ^ whom
72348 ^ also
72349 ^ having seized,
72350 ^ he put
72351 ^ in prison,
72353 ^ having delivered [him]
72354 ^ to four sets of four soldiers
72357 ^ to guard
72358 ^ him,
72359 ^ intending
72360 ^ after the passover
72363 ^ to bring out
72364 ^ him
72365 ^ to the people.
72367 ^ -
72368 ^ indeed
72369 ^ therefore
72370 ^ peter
72371 ^ was kept
72372 ^ in the prison;
72375 ^ prayer
72376 ^ however
72377 ^ was
72378 ^ fervent
72379 ^ being made
72380 ^ by the church
72383 ^ to - god
72386 ^ concerning him.
72388 ^ when
72389 ^ then
72390 ^ was about
72391 ^ to bring forth
72392 ^ him
72393 ^ - herod,
72395 ^ the night that,
72398 ^ was
72399 ^ - peter
72401 ^ sleeping
72402 ^ between two soldiers,
72405 ^ having been bound
72406 ^ with chains two,
72408 ^ guards
72409 ^ also
72410 ^ before the door
72413 ^ were watching
72414 ^ the prison.
72416 ^ and
72417 ^ behold,
72418 ^ an angel of [the] lord
72420 ^ stood by,
72421 ^ and
72422 ^ a light
72423 ^ shone
72424 ^ in the cell.
72427 ^ having struck
72428 ^ then
72429 ^ the side
72431 ^ - of peter,
72433 ^ he woke up
72434 ^ him,
72435 ^ saying,
72436 ^ rise up
72437 ^ in haste.
72439 ^ and
72440 ^ fell
72441 ^ of him the chains
72444 ^ off the hands.
72447 ^ said
72448 ^ then
72449 ^ the angel
72451 ^ to him,
72453 ^ gird yourself about
72454 ^ and
72455 ^ put on
72456 ^ the sandals of you.
72459 ^ he did
72460 ^ and
72461 ^ so.
72462 ^ and
72463 ^ he says
72464 ^ to him,
72465 ^ wrap around [you]
72466 ^ the cloak of you
72469 ^ and
72470 ^ follow
72471 ^ me.
72472 ^ and
72473 ^ having gone forth,
72474 ^ he was following
72475 ^ and
72476 ^ not
72477 ^ did know
72478 ^ that
72479 ^ real
72480 ^ is
72481 ^ what is happening
72483 ^ by means of the angel;
72486 ^ he was thinking
72487 ^ however
72488 ^ a vision
72489 ^ he saw.
72490 ^ having passed through
72491 ^ then
72492 ^ a first guard
72494 ^ and a second,
72496 ^ they came
72497 ^ to the gate
72500 ^ - iron
72502 ^ - leading
72504 ^ into the city,
72507 ^ which
72508 ^ by itself
72509 ^ opened
72510 ^ to them.
72511 ^ and
72512 ^ having gone out
72513 ^ they went on through
72514 ^ street one,
72516 ^ and
72517 ^ immediately
72518 ^ departed
72519 ^ the angel
72521 ^ from him.
72523 ^ and
72524 ^ - peter
72526 ^ to himself
72528 ^ having come,
72529 ^ said,
72530 ^ now
72531 ^ i know
72532 ^ truly
72533 ^ that
72534 ^ has sent forth
72535 ^ the lord
72537 ^ the angel of him
72540 ^ and
72541 ^ delivered
72542 ^ me
72543 ^ out of [the] hand of herod
72546 ^ and all the expectation
72550 ^ of the people
72552 ^ of the jews.
72554 ^ having considered [it]
72555 ^ also,
72556 ^ he came
72557 ^ to the house
72560 ^ of mary
72562 ^ the mother
72564 ^ of john,
72565 ^ who is called
72567 ^ mark,
72568 ^ where
72569 ^ were
72570 ^ many
72571 ^ having gathered together
72572 ^ and
72573 ^ praying.
72574 ^ having knocked
72575 ^ then
72576 ^ of him
72577 ^ [at] the door
72579 ^ of the gate,
72581 ^ came
72582 ^ a girl
72583 ^ to answer,
72584 ^ named rhoda.
72586 ^ and
72587 ^ having recognized
72588 ^ the voice
72590 ^ - of peter,
72592 ^ from - joy
72595 ^ not
72596 ^ she opened
72597 ^ the gate,
72599 ^ having run in;
72600 ^ but
72601 ^ she reported
72602 ^ to be standing
72603 ^ - peter
72605 ^ before the gate.
72608 ^ -
72609 ^ and
72610 ^ to her
72612 ^ they said,
72613 ^ you are out of your mind.
72614 ^ -
72615 ^ but
72616 ^ she kept insisting
72617 ^ [it] so
72618 ^ to be.
72619 ^ -
72620 ^ and
72621 ^ they kept saying,
72622 ^ the angel
72624 ^ it is
72625 ^ of him.
72626 ^ -
72627 ^ but
72628 ^ peter
72629 ^ continued
72630 ^ knocking;
72631 ^ having opened [it]
72632 ^ then,
72633 ^ they saw
72634 ^ him
72635 ^ and
72636 ^ were amazed.
72637 ^ having made a sign
72638 ^ then
72639 ^ to them
72640 ^ with the hand
72642 ^ to be silent,
72643 ^ he related
72644 ^ to them
72645 ^ how
72646 ^ the lord
72648 ^ him
72649 ^ had brought
72650 ^ out of the prison.
72653 ^ he said
72654 ^ then,
72655 ^ report
72656 ^ to james
72657 ^ and to the brothers
72660 ^ these things.
72661 ^ and
72662 ^ having gone out,
72663 ^ he went
72664 ^ to another place.
72667 ^ having come
72668 ^ now
72669 ^ day,
72670 ^ there was
72671 ^ disturbance
72672 ^ no small
72674 ^ among the soldiers,
72677 ^ what
72678 ^ then [of]
72679 ^ - peter
72681 ^ has become.
72682 ^ herod
72683 ^ then
72684 ^ having sought after
72685 ^ him,
72686 ^ and
72687 ^ not
72688 ^ having found [him],
72689 ^ having examined
72690 ^ the guards,
72692 ^ he commanded [them]
72693 ^ to be led away [to death].
72694 ^ and
72695 ^ having gone down
72696 ^ from - judea
72699 ^ to caesarea,
72701 ^ he stayed [there].
72702 ^ he had been
72703 ^ now
72704 ^ furiously angry
72705 ^ with [the] tyrians
72706 ^ and sidonians;
72708 ^ with one accord
72709 ^ then
72710 ^ they came
72711 ^ to him.
72713 ^ and
72714 ^ having gained
72715 ^ blastus,
72716 ^ who [was]
72717 ^ over the bedchamber
72720 ^ of the king,
72722 ^ they were seeking
72723 ^ peace,
72724 ^ because of - being nourished
72727 ^ their - region
72730 ^ by the king’s.
72733 ^ on the appointed
72734 ^ now
72735 ^ day,
72736 ^ - herod,
72738 ^ having put on
72739 ^ apparel royal
72741 ^ and
72742 ^ having sat
72743 ^ on the throne,
72746 ^ was making an address
72747 ^ to them.
72749 ^ -
72750 ^ and
72751 ^ the people
72752 ^ were crying out,
72753 ^ of a god [this is the] voice,
72755 ^ and
72756 ^ not
72757 ^ of a man!
72758 ^ immediately
72759 ^ then
72760 ^ struck
72761 ^ him
72762 ^ an angel of [the] lord,
72764 ^ in return for that
72766 ^ not
72767 ^ he gave
72768 ^ the glory
72770 ^ - to god;
72772 ^ and
72773 ^ having been
72774 ^ eaten by worms,
72775 ^ he breathed his last.
72776 ^ -
72777 ^ but
72778 ^ the word
72779 ^ - of god
72781 ^ continued to grow
72782 ^ and
72783 ^ to multiply.
72784 ^ barnabas
72785 ^ then
72786 ^ and saul
72788 ^ returned,
72789 ^ to jerusalem
72791 ^ having fulfilled
72792 ^ the mission,
72794 ^ having taken with [them]
72795 ^ john,
72796 ^ the [one] having been called

72824 ^ herod
72825 ^ the tetrarch brought up with —
72828 ^ and saul.
72830 ^ as were ministering
72831 ^ now
72832 ^ they
72833 ^ to the lord
72835 ^ and
72836 ^ fasting,
72837 ^ said
72838 ^ the spirit
72840 ^ - holy,
72842 ^ set apart
72843 ^ then
72844 ^ to me
72845 ^ - barnabas
72847 ^ and saul
72849 ^ for the work
72852 ^ to which
72853 ^ i have called
72854 ^ them.
72855 ^ then
72856 ^ having fasted,
72857 ^ and
72858 ^ having prayed,
72859 ^ and
72860 ^ having laid
72861 ^ the hands
72863 ^ on them,
72864 ^ they sent [them] off.
72865 ^ they
72866 ^ indeed
72867 ^ therefore
72868 ^ having been sent forth
72869 ^ by the holy spirit,
72873 ^ went down
72874 ^ to seleucia.
72876 ^ from there
72877 ^ then
72878 ^ they sailed
72879 ^ to cyprus.
72881 ^ and
72882 ^ having come
72883 ^ into salamis,
72885 ^ they began proclaiming
72886 ^ the word
72888 ^ - of god
72890 ^ in the synagogues
72893 ^ of the jews.
72895 ^ they had
72896 ^ now
72897 ^ also
72898 ^ john [as]
72899 ^ a helper.
72900 ^ having passed through
72901 ^ now
72902 ^ all the island,
72905 ^ as far as paphos,
72907 ^ they found
72908 ^ a man —
72909 ^ a certain magician,
72911 ^ a false prophet jewish —
72913 ^ whose name
72915 ^ [was] bar-jesus,

72930 ^ desired
72931 ^ to hear

72938 ^ them
72939 ^ elymas
72940 ^ the magician —
72942 ^ thus
72943 ^ for

72949 ^ to turn away
72950 ^ the proconsul
72952 ^ from the faith.
72955 ^ saul
72956 ^ then,
72957 ^ -
72958 ^ also [called]
72959 ^ paul,
72960 ^ having been filled

73007 ^ upon him
73009 ^ mist
73010 ^ and darkness,
73012 ^ and
73013 ^ going about
73014 ^ he was seeking
73015 ^ someone to lead [him] by the hand.
73016 ^ then
73017 ^ having seen
73018 ^ the proconsul
73020 ^ that having happened,
73022 ^ he believed,
73023 ^ being astonished
73024 ^ at the teaching
73027 ^ of the lord.
73029 ^ having sailed
73030 ^ then
73031 ^ from - paphos

73053 ^ from - perga,
73056 ^ came
73057 ^ to antioch
73059 ^ - of pisidia,
73061 ^ and
73062 ^ having gone
73063 ^ into the synagogue
73066 ^ on the day
73068 ^ of the sabbaths,
73070 ^ they sat down.
73071 ^ after
73072 ^ then
73073 ^ the reading
73075 ^ of the law
73077 ^ and of the prophets,
73080 ^ sent
73081 ^ the rulers of the synagogue
73083 ^ to them,
73085 ^ saying,
73086 ^ men,
73087 ^ brothers,
73088 ^ if

73100 ^ then
73101 ^ paul,
73102 ^ and
73103 ^ having made a sign
73104 ^ with the hand,
73106 ^ he said,
73107 ^ men,

73129 ^ in the sojourn
73132 ^ in [the] land of egypt,
73135 ^ and
73136 ^ with arm uplifted,
73139 ^ brought
73140 ^ them
73141 ^ out of it,
73143 ^ and
73144 ^ of about forty years for a period
73147 ^ he endured the ways

73149 ^ in the wilderness,
73152 ^ and
73153 ^ having destroyed
73154 ^ nations seven
73156 ^ in [the] land of canaan,
73159 ^ he gave as an inheritance
73160 ^ the land of them —
73163 ^ during years
73165 ^ four hundred
73166 ^ and fifty.
73168 ^ and
73169 ^ after these things,
73171 ^ he gave [them]
73172 ^ judges
73173 ^ until samuel
73175 ^ the prophet.
73177 ^ then
73178 ^ they asked for
73179 ^ a king,
73180 ^ and
73181 ^ gave
73182 ^ to them
73183 ^ - god,

73201 ^ to them
73202 ^ as king,
73204 ^ to whom
73205 ^ also
73206 ^ he said,

73246 ^ to all the people of israel.
73250 ^ while
73251 ^ then
73252 ^ was fulfilling
73253 ^ john
73254 ^ the course,
73256 ^ he was saying,
73257 ^ whom

73259 ^ do you suppose
73260 ^ to be?
73261 ^ not
73262 ^ am
73263 ^ i [he],
73264 ^ but
73265 ^ behold,
73266 ^ he comes
73267 ^ after me,
73269 ^ of whom
73270 ^ not
73271 ^ i am
73272 ^ worthy
73273 ^ a sandal

73283 ^ and those
73285 ^ among you
73287 ^ fearing
73288 ^ - god,
73290 ^ to us
73291 ^ the message
73293 ^ of the salvation this
73296 ^ has been sent.
73297 ^ those
73298 ^ for

73313 ^ that
73314 ^ on every sabbath
73317 ^ are being read,
73318 ^ having condemned [him]
73319 ^ they fulfilled [them].
73320 ^ and
73321 ^ no cause of death
73324 ^ having found,
73325 ^ they begged
73326 ^ pilate
73327 ^ to put to death
73328 ^ him.
73329 ^ when
73330 ^ then
73331 ^ they had finished
73332 ^ all the things
73334 ^ about him
73336 ^ having been written,
73337 ^ having taken [him] down
73338 ^ from the tree,
73341 ^ they put [him]
73342 ^ in a tomb.
73344 ^ -
73345 ^ but
73346 ^ god
73347 ^ raised
73348 ^ him
73349 ^ out from [the] dead,
73351 ^ who
73352 ^ appeared
73353 ^ for days many
73356 ^ to those having come up with
73358 ^ him
73359 ^ from - galilee
73362 ^ to jerusalem,
73364 ^ who
73365 ^ now
73366 ^ are
73367 ^ witnesses of him
73369 ^ to the people.
73372 ^ and
73373 ^ we
73374 ^ to you
73375 ^ preach the gospel,
73376 ^ the
73377 ^ to the fathers promise
73381 ^ having been made,
73382 ^ that
73383 ^ this
73384 ^ - god
73386 ^ has fulfilled,
73387 ^ to the children of them, to us,
73391 ^ having raised up
73392 ^ jesus,
73393 ^ as
73394 ^ also
73395 ^ in the psalm
73398 ^ it has been written,
73399 ^ the second:

73408 ^ you.’
73409 ^ that
73410 ^ then
73411 ^ he raised
73412 ^ him
73413 ^ out from [the] dead,
73415 ^ no more
73416 ^ being about
73417 ^ to return
73418 ^ to decay,
73420 ^ thus
73421 ^ he spoke
73422 ^ -:
73423 ^ i will give
73424 ^ to you
73425 ^ the holy [blessings] of david,
73428 ^ the sure [blessings].’
73430 ^ therefore
73431 ^ also
73432 ^ in another
73434 ^ he says:

73449 ^ - of god purpose,
73452 ^ fell asleep
73453 ^ and
73454 ^ was added
73455 ^ to the fathers of him,
73459 ^ and
73460 ^ saw
73461 ^ decay.

73472 ^ be it
73473 ^ to you,
73474 ^ men,
73475 ^ brothers,
73476 ^ that
73477 ^ through this one,
73479 ^ to you
73480 ^ forgiveness of sins
73482 ^ is proclaimed.
73483 ^ and
73484 ^ from all things

73499 ^ take heed
73500 ^ therefore,
73501 ^ lest
73502 ^ might come about
73503 ^ that having been said
73505 ^ in the prophets:

73513 ^ and

73524 ^ that
73525 ^ never not
73527 ^ you would believe,
73528 ^ even if
73529 ^ one
73530 ^ should declare it
73531 ^ to you.’
73532 ^ having departed
73533 ^ then,
73534 ^ they
73535 ^ were begging
73536 ^ on the next sabbath
73540 ^ to be spoken
73541 ^ to them
73542 ^ the words these.
73545 ^ having broken up
73546 ^ then
73547 ^ the synagogue,
73549 ^ followed
73550 ^ many
73551 ^ of the jews
73553 ^ and of the
73555 ^ worshipping converts
73557 ^ - paul
73559 ^ and - barnabas,
73562 ^ who
73563 ^ speaking
73564 ^ to them
73565 ^ kept persuading
73566 ^ them
73567 ^ to continue
73568 ^ in the grace
73570 ^ - of god.
73572 ^ on the
73573 ^ now
73574 ^ coming sabbath,
73576 ^ almost
73577 ^ all the city
73580 ^ was gathered together
73581 ^ to hear
73582 ^ the word
73584 ^ - of the lord.
73586 ^ having seen
73587 ^ however
73588 ^ the jews
73590 ^ the crowds,
73592 ^ they were filled
73593 ^ with jealousy
73594 ^ and
73595 ^ began contradicting
73596 ^ the things
73597 ^ by paul
73599 ^ spoken,
73600 ^ blaspheming.
73601 ^ having spoken boldly
73602 ^ also, - paul
73605 ^ and - barnabas
73608 ^ said,
73609 ^ to you
73610 ^ it was
73611 ^ necessary
73612 ^ first
73613 ^ to be spoken
73614 ^ the word
73616 ^ - of god;
73618 ^ but since
73619 ^ you thrust away
73620 ^ it
73621 ^ and
73622 ^ not

73624 ^ you judge
73625 ^ yourselves
73626 ^ - of eternal life,
73629 ^ behold,
73630 ^ we are turning
73631 ^ to the gentiles.
73634 ^ thus
73635 ^ for
73636 ^ has commanded
73637 ^ us
73638 ^ the lord:

73641 ^ you
73642 ^ for a light of [the] gentiles,
73645 ^ - to be
73647 ^ you
73648 ^ for salvation
73650 ^ to [the] uttermost part
73652 ^ of the earth.’
73654 ^ hearing [it]
73655 ^ then,
73656 ^ the gentiles
73658 ^ were rejoicing
73659 ^ and
73660 ^ glorifying
73661 ^ the word
73663 ^ of the lord,
73665 ^ and
73666 ^ believed
73667 ^ as many as
73668 ^ were
73669 ^ appointed
73670 ^ to life eternal.
73673 ^ was carried
73674 ^ then
73675 ^ the word
73677 ^ of the lord
73679 ^ through all the region.

73687 ^ the
73688 ^ worshipping women
73690 ^ - of honorable position,
73692 ^ and the principals
73695 ^ of the city,
73697 ^ and
73698 ^ they stirred up
73699 ^ a persecution
73700 ^ against - paul
73703 ^ and barnabas,
73705 ^ and
73706 ^ expelled
73707 ^ them
73708 ^ from the district of them.
73712 ^ -
73713 ^ but
73714 ^ having shaken off
73715 ^ the dust
73717 ^ of the feet
73719 ^ against them,
73721 ^ they went
73722 ^ to iconium;
73724 ^ -
73725 ^ and
73726 ^ the disciples
73727 ^ were filled
73728 ^ with joy
73729 ^ and [the] spirit holy.
73732 ^ it came to pass
73733 ^ now
73734 ^ in iconium,
73736 ^ according to the same
73739 ^ entered
73740 ^ they
73741 ^ into the synagogue
73744 ^ of the jews
73746 ^ and

73753 ^ and greeks a great number.
73757 ^ the
73758 ^ however
73759 ^ unbelieving jews
73761 ^ stirred up
73762 ^ and
73763 ^ poisoned
73764 ^ the minds
73766 ^ of the gentiles
73768 ^ against the brothers.
73771 ^ a long
73772 ^ indeed
73773 ^ therefore
73774 ^ time
73775 ^ they stayed,
73776 ^ speaking boldly
73777 ^ for the lord,
73780 ^ the [one] bearing witness
73782 ^ to the word
73785 ^ of the grace of him,
73788 ^ granting
73789 ^ signs
73790 ^ and wonders
73792 ^ to be done
73793 ^ through the hands of them.
73797 ^ was divided
73798 ^ now
73799 ^ the multitude
73801 ^ of the city,
73803 ^ and
73804 ^ some
73805 ^ indeed
73806 ^ were
73807 ^ with the jews;
73810 ^ some
73811 ^ however
73812 ^ with the apostles.
73815 ^ when
73816 ^ then
73817 ^ there was
73818 ^ a rush
73819 ^ of the gentiles both
73822 ^ and jews,
73824 ^ with the rulers of them,
73828 ^ to mistreat
73829 ^ and
73830 ^ to stone
73831 ^ them,
73832 ^ having become aware,
73833 ^ they fled
73834 ^ to the cities
73837 ^ - of lycaonia,
73839 ^ lystra,
73840 ^ and derbe,
73842 ^ and the surrounding region,
73845 ^ and there
73846 ^ preaching the gospel
73847 ^ they continued.
73848 ^ and
73849 ^ a certain man
73851 ^ crippled,
73852 ^ in lystra,
73854 ^ in the feet,
73856 ^ was sitting,
73857 ^ lame
73858 ^ from [the] womb

73875 ^ that
73876 ^ he has
73877 ^ faith
73878 ^ - to be healed,
73880 ^ said
73881 ^ in a loud voice,
73883 ^ stand
73884 ^ on the feet of you
73888 ^ upright!
73889 ^ and
73890 ^ he sprang up
73891 ^ and
73892 ^ began to walk.
73893 ^ -
73894 ^ and
73895 ^ the crowds
73896 ^ having seen
73897 ^ what
73898 ^ had done
73899 ^ paul,
73900 ^ lifted up
73901 ^ the voice of them
73904 ^ in lycaonian,
73905 ^ saying,
73906 ^ the gods,
73908 ^ having become like
73909 ^ men,
73910 ^ have come down
73911 ^ to us.

73915 ^ - barnabas
73917 ^ zeus,
73918 ^ -
73919 ^ and
73920 ^ paul

73953 ^ the apostles
73955 ^ barnabas
73956 ^ and paul,
73958 ^ having torn
73959 ^ the garments of them,
73962 ^ rushed out
73963 ^ into the crowd,
73966 ^ crying out
73967 ^ and
73968 ^ saying,
73969 ^ men,
73970 ^ why
73971 ^ these things
73972 ^ do you?
73973 ^ also
73974 ^ we

73977 ^ with you men,
73979 ^ proclaiming the gospel
73980 ^ to you,
73981 ^ from these - vanities
73985 ^ to turn
73986 ^ to god
73988 ^ [the] living,
73989 ^ who
73990 ^ made
73991 ^ the heaven
73993 ^ and the earth
73996 ^ and the sea
73999 ^ and all the things
74002 ^ in them,
74004 ^ who
74005 ^ in the
74007 ^ past generations
74009 ^ allowed
74010 ^ all the nations
74013 ^ to go
74014 ^ the ways of them.
74017 ^ and yet
74018 ^ not

74037 ^ and
74038 ^ these things
74039 ^ saying,
74040 ^ hardly
74041 ^ they stopped
74042 ^ the crowds

74069 ^ to have died.

74071 ^ however
74072 ^ the disciples
74074 ^ him,
74075 ^ having risen up,
74076 ^ he entered
74077 ^ into the city.
74080 ^ and

74097 ^ they returned
74098 ^ to - lystra,
74101 ^ and to iconium,
74104 ^ and to antioch,
74107 ^ strengthening
74108 ^ the souls

74112 ^ exhorting [them]
74113 ^ to continue
74114 ^ in the faith,
74116 ^ and
74117 ^ that

74138 ^ they committed
74139 ^ them
74140 ^ to the lord,
74142 ^ in whom
74144 ^ they had believed.
74145 ^ and
74146 ^ having passed through

74149 ^ they came
74150 ^ to - pamphylia,
74153 ^ and
74154 ^ having spoken
74155 ^ in perga
74157 ^ the word,
74159 ^ they went down
74160 ^ to attalia.
74162 ^ and from there
74163 ^ they sailed
74164 ^ to antioch,
74166 ^ from where
74167 ^ they had
74168 ^ been committed

74179 ^ now
74180 ^ and

74182 ^ the church,
74184 ^ they began declaring

74186 ^ had done
74187 ^ - god
74189 ^ with them,
74191 ^ and
74192 ^ that
74193 ^ he had opened
74194 ^ to the gentiles
74196 ^ a door of faith.
74198 ^ they remained
74199 ^ then
74200 ^ time
74201 ^ no little
74203 ^ with the disciples.
74206 ^ and
74207 ^ certain ones
74208 ^ having come down
74209 ^ from - judea
74212 ^ were teaching
74213 ^ the brothers
74215 ^ -,
74216 ^ if

74218 ^ you are circumcised
74219 ^ according to the custom
74221 ^ - of moses,
74223 ^ not
74224 ^ you are able
74225 ^ to be saved.
74226 ^ having been brought about
74227 ^ then
74228 ^ commotion
74229 ^ and discussion
74231 ^ no small
74233 ^ - by paul
74235 ^ and - barnabas
74238 ^ with them,
74240 ^ they appointed
74241 ^ to go up

74243 ^ and barnabas
74245 ^ and certain others
74248 ^ out from them,
74250 ^ to the apostles
74253 ^ and elders,
74255 ^ to jerusalem,
74257 ^ about the question this.
74261 ^ they
74262 ^ indeed
74263 ^ therefore
74264 ^ having been sent forward
74265 ^ by the church
74268 ^ were passing through
74269 ^ - both phoenicia
74272 ^ and samaria,
74274 ^ relating in detail
74275 ^ the conversion
74277 ^ of the gentiles,
74279 ^ and
74280 ^ they were bringing
74281 ^ joy great
74283 ^ to all the brothers.
74286 ^ having come
74287 ^ then
74288 ^ to jerusalem,
74290 ^ they were welcomed
74291 ^ by the church
74294 ^ and the apostles
74297 ^ and the elders.
74300 ^ they declared
74301 ^ then
74302 ^ all that
74303 ^ - god
74305 ^ had done
74306 ^ with them.
74308 ^ rose up
74309 ^ now
74310 ^ certain
74311 ^ of those
74312 ^ of the sect
74315 ^ of the pharisees
74317 ^ who believed,
74318 ^ saying
74319 ^ -,
74320 ^ it is necessary
74321 ^ to circumcise
74322 ^ them,
74323 ^ to command [them]
74324 ^ then
74325 ^ to keep
74326 ^ the law of moses.
74329 ^ were gathered together
74330 ^ then
74331 ^ the apostles
74333 ^ and the elders
74336 ^ to see
74337 ^ about the matter this.
74341 ^ of much
74342 ^ now
74343 ^ discussion
74344 ^ having taken place,
74345 ^ having risen up,
74346 ^ peter
74347 ^ said
74348 ^ to them,
74350 ^ men,
74351 ^ brothers,
74352 ^ you
74353 ^ know
74354 ^ that
74355 ^ from days early,
74358 ^ among you
74360 ^ chose
74361 ^ - god
74363 ^ by the mouth of me
74367 ^ to hear
74368 ^ the gentiles
74370 ^ the word
74372 ^ of the gospel,
74374 ^ and
74375 ^ to believe.
74376 ^ and
74377 ^ the heart-knowing god
74380 ^ bore witness
74381 ^ to them,
74382 ^ having given [them]
74383 ^ the spirit
74385 ^ - holy,
74387 ^ as
74388 ^ also
74389 ^ to us,
74390 ^ and
74391 ^ not one
74392 ^ he made distinction
74393 ^ between us also
74396 ^ and them,
74398 ^ by the faith
74400 ^ having purified
74401 ^ the hearts of them.
74404 ^ now
74405 ^ therefore,
74406 ^ why
74407 ^ are you testing
74408 ^ - god,
74410 ^ to put
74411 ^ a yoke
74412 ^ upon the neck
74415 ^ of the disciples
74417 ^ that
74418 ^ neither
74419 ^ the fathers of us,
74422 ^ nor we,
74424 ^ have been able
74425 ^ to bear?
74426 ^ but
74427 ^ by the grace
74430 ^ of [the] lord jesus,
74433 ^ we believe
74434 ^ to be saved,
74435 ^ in [the] same manner [as]
74438 ^ they also.
74439 ^ kept silent
74440 ^ now
74441 ^ all the multitude,
74444 ^ and
74445 ^ were listening to
74446 ^ barnabas
74447 ^ and paul
74449 ^ relating
74450 ^ what
74451 ^ had done
74452 ^ - god,
74454 ^ signs
74455 ^ and wonders,
74457 ^ among the gentiles
74460 ^ by them.
74462 ^ after
74463 ^ now
74464 ^ - were silent
74466 ^ they,
74467 ^ answered
74468 ^ james,
74469 ^ saying,
74470 ^ men,
74471 ^ brothers,
74472 ^ hear
74473 ^ me.
74474 ^ simeon
74475 ^ has related
74476 ^ how
74477 ^ first
74478 ^ - god
74480 ^ visited,
74481 ^ to take
74482 ^ out of [the] gentiles
74484 ^ a people
74485 ^ for the name of him.
74488 ^ and
74489 ^ with this
74490 ^ agree
74491 ^ the words
74493 ^ of the prophets,
74495 ^ as
74496 ^ it is written:
74497 ^ after these things
74499 ^ i will return
74500 ^ and
74501 ^ will rebuild
74502 ^ the tabernacle of david
74505 ^ which has fallen,
74507 ^ and
74508 ^ the ruins of it
74511 ^ i will rebuild,
74512 ^ and
74513 ^ i will set upright
74514 ^ it,
74515 ^ so that
74516 ^ -
74517 ^ may seek out
74518 ^ the remnant
74520 ^ - of men
74522 ^ the lord,
74524 ^ and
74525 ^ all the gentiles,
74528 ^ upon whom
74530 ^ has been called
74531 ^ the name of me
74534 ^ upon them,
74536 ^ says
74537 ^ [the] lord,
74538 ^ doing
74539 ^ these things,
74540 ^ known
74541 ^ from eternity.’
74543 ^ therefore
74544 ^ i
74545 ^ judge
74546 ^ not
74547 ^ to trouble
74548 ^ those who,
74549 ^ from the gentiles,
74552 ^ are turning
74553 ^ to - god,
74556 ^ but
74557 ^ to write
74558 ^ to them
74559 ^ - to abstain from
74561 ^ the pollutions
74563 ^ of the idols,
74565 ^ and - sexual immorality,
74568 ^ and that which is strangled,
74571 ^ and from blood.
74574 ^ moses
74575 ^ for
74576 ^ from generations of old,
74579 ^ in every city
74581 ^ [ones] proclaiming
74583 ^ him
74584 ^ has,
74585 ^ in the synagogues
74588 ^ on every sabbath
74591 ^ being read.
74592 ^ then
74593 ^ it seemed good
74594 ^ to the apostles
74596 ^ and to the elders,
74599 ^ with all the church,
74603 ^ having chosen
74604 ^ men
74605 ^ out from them,
74607 ^ to send
74608 ^ to antioch
74610 ^ with - paul
74613 ^ and barnabas:
74615 ^ judas
74616 ^ - called
74618 ^ barsabbas,
74619 ^ and silas,
74621 ^ men
74622 ^ leading
74623 ^ among the brothers,
74626 ^ having written
74627 ^ by [the] hand of them:
74630 ^ the apostles
74632 ^ and the elders, brothers,
74636 ^ to those
74637 ^ in - antioch
74640 ^ and syria
74642 ^ and cilicia, brothers
74645 ^ -
74646 ^ among the gentiles:
74648 ^ greetings.
74649 ^ inasmuch as
74650 ^ we have heard
74651 ^ that
74652 ^ some
74653 ^ from us
74655 ^ went out
74656 ^ troubled
74657 ^ you
74658 ^ by words,
74659 ^ upsetting
74660 ^ the minds of you,
74663 ^ to whom
74664 ^ not
74665 ^ we had given instructions,
74666 ^ it seemed good
74667 ^ to us
74668 ^ having come
74669 ^ with one accord,
74670 ^ having chosen
74671 ^ men,
74672 ^ to send
74673 ^ to you,
74675 ^ with the
74677 ^ beloved of us, barnabas
74680 ^ and paul,
74682 ^ men
74683 ^ having handed over
74684 ^ the lives of them
74687 ^ for the name
74690 ^ of the lord of us,
74693 ^ jesus christ.
74695 ^ we have sent
74696 ^ therefore
74697 ^ judas
74698 ^ and silas,
74700 ^ and
74701 ^ they
74702 ^ by word [of mouth]
74704 ^ are telling [you]
74705 ^ the same things.
74707 ^ it seemed good
74708 ^ for
74709 ^ to the spirit
74711 ^ - holy
74713 ^ and to us,
74715 ^ no further
74717 ^ to lay
74718 ^ upon you
74719 ^ burden,
74720 ^ except these - necessary things:
74724 ^ to abstain
74725 ^ from things sacrificed to idols,
74726 ^ and from blood,
74728 ^ and from what is strangled,
74730 ^ and from sexual immorality.
74732 ^ from these
74734 ^ keeping
74735 ^ yourselves,
74736 ^ well
74737 ^ you will do.
74738 ^ farewell.
74739 ^ they
74740 ^ indeed
74741 ^ therefore,
74742 ^ having been sent off,
74743 ^ went
74744 ^ to antioch,
74746 ^ and
74747 ^ having gathered
74748 ^ the multitude,
74750 ^ they delivered
74751 ^ the letter.
74753 ^ having read [it]
74754 ^ now,
74755 ^ they rejoiced
74756 ^ at the encouragement.
74759 ^ judas both
74761 ^ and silas,
74763 ^ also
74764 ^ themselves
74765 ^ prophets
74766 ^ being,
74767 ^ by talk much
74770 ^ exhorted
74771 ^ the brothers
74773 ^ and
74774 ^ strengthened [them].
74775 ^ having continued
74776 ^ then
74777 ^ a time,
74778 ^ they were sent away
74779 ^ in peace
74781 ^ from the brothers
74784 ^ to those having sent
74787 ^ them.
74788 ^ paul
74789 ^ however
74790 ^ and barnabas
74792 ^ stayed
74793 ^ in antioch,
74795 ^ teaching
74796 ^ and
74797 ^ proclaiming the good news,
74798 ^ with also others many,
74802 ^ the word
74804 ^ of the lord.
74806 ^ after
74807 ^ now
74808 ^ some days,
74810 ^ said
74811 ^ to barnabas,
74813 ^ paul,
74814 ^ having turned back
74815 ^ indeed
74816 ^ let us look after
74817 ^ the brothers
74819 ^ in city
74821 ^ every
74822 ^ in which
74824 ^ we have announced
74825 ^ the word
74827 ^ of the lord,
74829 ^ how
74830 ^ they are.
74831 ^ barnabas
74832 ^ now
74833 ^ purposed
74834 ^ to take along
74835 ^ also
74836 ^ - john
74838 ^ - called
74840 ^ mark;
74841 ^ paul
74842 ^ however
74843 ^ thought fit,
74844 ^ the [one] having withdrawn
74846 ^ from them
74848 ^ from pamphylia
74850 ^ and
74851 ^ not
74852 ^ having gone with
74853 ^ them
74854 ^ to the work,
74857 ^ not
74858 ^ to take along
74859 ^ him.
74860 ^ arose
74861 ^ therefore
74862 ^ a sharp disagreement,
74863 ^ so that
74864 ^ separated
74865 ^ they
74866 ^ from one another;
74868 ^ -
74869 ^ and
74870 ^ barnabas,
74871 ^ having taken
74872 ^ - mark,
74874 ^ sailed
74875 ^ to cyprus.
74877 ^ paul
74878 ^ however,
74879 ^ having chosen
74880 ^ silas,
74881 ^ went forth,
74882 ^ having been committed
74883 ^ to the grace
74885 ^ of the lord
74887 ^ by the brothers.
74890 ^ he was passing through
74891 ^ then
74892 ^ - syria
74894 ^ and - cilicia,
74897 ^ strengthening
74898 ^ the churches.
74900 ^ he came
74901 ^ then
74902 ^ also
74903 ^ to derbe
74905 ^ and to lystra.
74908 ^ and
74909 ^ behold,
74910 ^ a disciple
74911 ^ certain
74912 ^ was
74913 ^ there,
74914 ^ named timothy,
74916 ^ [the] son
74917 ^ of a woman
74918 ^ jewish believing,
74920 ^ father
74921 ^ however
74922 ^ a greek,
74923 ^ who
74924 ^ was well spoken of
74925 ^ by the
74927 ^ in lystra
74929 ^ and iconium brothers.
74932 ^ this one
74933 ^ wanted
74934 ^ - paul
74936 ^ with him
74938 ^ to go forth,
74939 ^ and
74940 ^ having taken,
74941 ^ he circumcised
74942 ^ him
74943 ^ on account of the jews
74946 ^ - being
74948 ^ in the parts those;
74952 ^ they knew
74953 ^ for
74954 ^ all

75923 ^ in
75924 ^ now
75925 ^ - athens,
75927 ^ waiting for
75928 ^ them
75929 ^ - of paul,
75931 ^ was provoked
75932 ^ the spirit of him
75935 ^ in him,
75937 ^ seeing
75938 ^ utterly idolatrous
75939 ^ to be the city.
75942 ^ he was reasoning
75943 ^ indeed
75944 ^ therefore
75945 ^ in the synagogue
75948 ^ with the jews
75950 ^ and those worshiping,
75953 ^ and
75954 ^ in the marketplace
75957 ^ on every day
75960 ^ with those meeting [him].
75963 ^ some
75964 ^ then
75965 ^ also
75966 ^ of the epicureans
75968 ^ and stoics, philosophers,
75971 ^ encountered
75972 ^ him.
75973 ^ and
75974 ^ some
75975 ^ were saying,
75976 ^ what
75977 ^ -
75978 ^ may desire
75979 ^ of the babbler this
75982 ^ to say?
75983 ^ others
75984 ^ however,
75985 ^ of foreign gods
75987 ^ he seems
75988 ^ a proclaimer
75989 ^ to be,
75990 ^ because
75991 ^ - jesus
75993 ^ and the resurrection
75996 ^ he was proclaiming the gospel of.
75997 ^ having taken hold
75998 ^ also
75999 ^ of him,
76000 ^ to the ares hill
76004 ^ they brought [him],
76005 ^ saying,
76006 ^ are we able
76007 ^ to know
76008 ^ what [is]
76009 ^ the new this, which
76013 ^ by you
76015 ^ is spoken, teaching?
76017 ^ strange things
76018 ^ for
76019 ^ some
76020 ^ you are bringing
76021 ^ to the ears of us.
76025 ^ we resolve
76026 ^ therefore
76027 ^ to know
76028 ^ what
76029 ^ wish
76030 ^ these things
76031 ^ to be.
76032 ^ [the] athenians
76033 ^ now
76034 ^ all,
76035 ^ and the
76037 ^ visiting strangers,
76039 ^ in nothing else
76042 ^ spent their time
76043 ^ than
76044 ^ to tell
76045 ^ something
76046 ^ and
76047 ^ to hear
76048 ^ something new.
76050 ^ having stood
76051 ^ then
76052 ^ - paul
76054 ^ in [the] midst
76056 ^ of the ares hill,
76059 ^ he was saying,
76060 ^ men,
76061 ^ athenians,
76062 ^ in all things as very religious
76066 ^ you
76067 ^ i behold.
76068 ^ passing through
76069 ^ for
76070 ^ and
76071 ^ beholding
76072 ^ the objects of worship of you,
76075 ^ i found
76076 ^ even
76077 ^ an altar
76078 ^ on which
76080 ^ had been inscribed:
76081 ^ to an unknown god.
76083 ^ whom
76084 ^ therefore
76085 ^ not knowing
76086 ^ you worship,
76087 ^ him
76088 ^ i
76089 ^ proclaim
76090 ^ to you.
76091 ^ the god
76093 ^ - having made
76095 ^ the world
76097 ^ and all things that [are]
76100 ^ in it,
76102 ^ he
76103 ^ of heaven
76104 ^ and earth
76106 ^ being
76107 ^ lord,
76108 ^ not
76109 ^ in hand-made temples
76112 ^ dwells,
76113 ^ nor
76114 ^ by hands of men
76117 ^ is he served,
76118 ^ as needing
76119 ^ anything,
76120 ^ himself
76121 ^ giving
76122 ^ to all
76123 ^ life
76124 ^ and breath,
76126 ^ and the all;
76129 ^ he made
76130 ^ then
76131 ^ of one,
76133 ^ every nation of men,
76136 ^ to dwell
76137 ^ upon all the face

76142 ^ having determined
76143 ^ [the] appointed times
76145 ^ and the boundaries
76148 ^ of the habitation of them,
76151 ^ to seek
76152 ^ - god,
76154 ^ if
76155 ^ perhaps
76156 ^ indeed
76157 ^ they might palpate for
76158 ^ him,
76159 ^ and
76160 ^ might find him.
76161 ^ and
76162 ^ indeed,
76163 ^ not

76181 ^ of the
76182 ^ among you poets
76185 ^ have said,
76186 ^ of [him]
76187 ^ for
76188 ^ also
76189 ^ offspring
76190 ^ we are.’
76191 ^ offspring
76192 ^ therefore
76193 ^ being
76194 ^ - of god,

76197 ^ we ought
76198 ^ to consider
76199 ^ to gold,
76200 ^ or to silver,
76202 ^ or to stone,
76204 ^ a graven thing,

76214 ^ indeed

76217 ^ - of ignorance
76219 ^ having overlooked
76220 ^ - god,
76222 ^ - now
76224 ^ he commands
76225 ^ - men
76227 ^ all
76228 ^ everywhere
76229 ^ to repent,
76230 ^ because
76231 ^ he set
76232 ^ a day
76233 ^ in which
76235 ^ he is about
76236 ^ to judge
76237 ^ the world
76239 ^ in righteousness,
76241 ^ by a man
76243 ^ whom
76244 ^ he appointed,
76245 ^ a guarantee
76246 ^ having provided
76247 ^ to all,
76248 ^ having raised
76249 ^ him
76250 ^ out from [the] dead.
76252 ^ having heard of
76253 ^ now
76254 ^ a resurrection of [the] dead,
76256 ^ some
76257 ^ indeed
76258 ^ began to mock [him];
76259 ^ some
76260 ^ however
76261 ^ said,
76262 ^ we will hear
76263 ^ you
76264 ^ concerning this
76266 ^ also
76267 ^ again.
76268 ^ thus
76269 ^ - paul
76271 ^ went out
76272 ^ from [the] midst of them.
76275 ^ some
76276 ^ however
76277 ^ men,
76278 ^ having joined themselves
76279 ^ to him,
76280 ^ believed,
76281 ^ among whom
76283 ^ also
76284 ^ [were] dionysius
76285 ^ the areopagite,
76287 ^ and a woman
76289 ^ named damaris,
76291 ^ and others
76293 ^ with them.
76295 ^ and after these things,
76297 ^ having departed
76298 ^ from - athens,
76301 ^ he came
76302 ^ to corinth.
76304 ^ and
76305 ^ having found
76306 ^ a certain
76307 ^ jew
76308 ^ named aquila,
76310 ^ of pontus
76311 ^ - a native,
76313 ^ recently
76314 ^ having come
76315 ^ from - italy,
76318 ^ and priscilla
76320 ^ wife of him,
76322 ^ because of - having commanded
76325 ^ claudius
76326 ^ to depart
76327 ^ all the jews
76330 ^ out of - rome,
76333 ^ he came
76334 ^ to them,
76335 ^ and
76336 ^ due to of the
76338 ^ same trade
76339 ^ being,
76340 ^ he stayed
76341 ^ with them
76343 ^ and
76344 ^ worked;
76345 ^ they were
76346 ^ for
76347 ^ tentmakers
76348 ^ by the trade.
76350 ^ he was reasoning
76351 ^ now
76352 ^ in the synagogue
76355 ^ on every sabbath,
76358 ^ persuading
76359 ^ both
76360 ^ jews
76361 ^ and greeks.
76363 ^ when
76364 ^ now
76365 ^ came down
76366 ^ from - macedonia
76369 ^ - both silas
76372 ^ and - timothy,
76375 ^ was occupied
76376 ^ with the word
76378 ^ - paul,
76380 ^ earnestly testifying
76381 ^ to the jews
76383 ^ to be
76384 ^ the christ
76386 ^ jesus.
76387 ^ opposing
76388 ^ however
76389 ^ of them
76390 ^ and
76391 ^ reviling [him],
76392 ^ having shaken out
76393 ^ the garments,
76395 ^ he said
76396 ^ to them,
76398 ^ the blood of you
76401 ^ [be] upon the head of you;
76405 ^ clean
76406 ^ i [am].
76407 ^ from - now on,
76410 ^ to the gentiles
76413 ^ i will go.
76414 ^ and
76415 ^ having departed
76416 ^ from there
76417 ^ he came
76418 ^ to [the] house
76420 ^ of a certain one
76421 ^ named titius justus,
76424 ^ worshiping
76425 ^ - god,
76427 ^ of whom the house
76430 ^ was
76431 ^ adjoining
76432 ^ the synagogue.
76434 ^ crispus
76435 ^ now,
76436 ^ the ruler of the synagogue,
76438 ^ believed
76439 ^ in the lord,
76441 ^ with all the household of him.
76446 ^ and
76447 ^ many
76448 ^ of the corinthians
76450 ^ hearing,
76451 ^ believed
76452 ^ and
76453 ^ were baptized.
76454 ^ said
76455 ^ now
76456 ^ the lord
76458 ^ in [the] night
76460 ^ through a vision
76462 ^ - to paul,
76464 ^ not
76465 ^ fear,
76466 ^ but
76467 ^ continue speaking,
76468 ^ and
76469 ^ not
76470 ^ be silent,
76471 ^ because
76472 ^ i
76473 ^ am
76474 ^ with you,
76476 ^ and
76477 ^ no one
76478 ^ will lay a hand on
76479 ^ you
76480 ^ - to harm
76482 ^ you,
76483 ^ because
76484 ^ people
76485 ^ there are
76486 ^ to me
76487 ^ many
76488 ^ in the city this.
76492 ^ he remained
76493 ^ now
76494 ^ a year
76495 ^ and months six,
76498 ^ teaching
76499 ^ among them
76501 ^ the word
76503 ^ - of god.
76505 ^ gallio
76506 ^ however
76507 ^ proconsul
76508 ^ being
76509 ^ of achaia,
76511 ^ rose up against
76512 ^ with one accord
76513 ^ the jews
76515 ^ - paul,
76517 ^ and
76518 ^ led
76519 ^ him
76520 ^ to the judgment seat,
76523 ^ saying
76524 ^ -,
76525 ^ contrary to the law,
76528 ^ persuades
76529 ^ this [man]
76530 ^ - men
76532 ^ to worship
76533 ^ - god.
76535 ^ being about
76536 ^ now
76537 ^ - paul
76539 ^ to open
76540 ^ the mouth,
76542 ^ said
76543 ^ - gallio
76545 ^ to the jews,
76548 ^ if
76549 ^ indeed
76550 ^ it was
76551 ^ unrighteousness some
76553 ^ or crime wicked,
76556 ^ o jews,
76558 ^ according to reason
76560 ^ -
76561 ^ i would have endured with
76562 ^ you;
76563 ^ if
76564 ^ however
76565 ^ a question
76566 ^ it is
76567 ^ about a word,
76569 ^ and names,
76571 ^ and law
76573 ^ -
76574 ^ in reference to your,
76576 ^ you will see
76577 ^ [to it] yourselves;
76578 ^ a judge
76579 ^ i
76580 ^ of these things
76581 ^ not
76582 ^ resolve
76583 ^ to be.
76584 ^ and
76585 ^ he drove
76586 ^ them
76587 ^ from the judgment seat.
76590 ^ having seized
76591 ^ then
76592 ^ all [of them]
76593 ^ sosthenes,
76594 ^ the ruler of the synagogue,
76596 ^ they began to beat [him]
76597 ^ before the judgment seat.
76600 ^ and
76601 ^ nothing about these things
76603 ^ - to gallio
76605 ^ it mattered.
76606 ^ -
76607 ^ now
76608 ^ paul,
76609 ^ more
76610 ^ having remained
76611 ^ days many,
76613 ^ the brothers
76615 ^ having taken leave of,
76616 ^ sailed away
76617 ^ to - syria —
76620 ^ and
76621 ^ with him
76623 ^ priscilla
76624 ^ and aquila —
76626 ^ having shaved
76627 ^ in cenchrea
76629 ^ the head;
76631 ^ he had
76632 ^ for
76633 ^ a vow.
76634 ^ they came
76635 ^ now
76636 ^ to ephesus,
76638 ^ and them
76639 ^ left
76640 ^ there.
76641 ^ he himself
76642 ^ then
76643 ^ having entered
76644 ^ into the synagogue,
76647 ^ he reasoned
76648 ^ with the jews.
76650 ^ asking [him]
76651 ^ now
76652 ^ of them
76653 ^ for a longer time
76656 ^ to remain,
76657 ^ not
76658 ^ he did consent,
76659 ^ but
76660 ^ having taken leave
76661 ^ and
76662 ^ having said,
76663 ^ again
76664 ^ i will return
76665 ^ to you,
76667 ^ - god
76669 ^ willing,
76670 ^ he sailed
76671 ^ from - ephesus,
76674 ^ and
76675 ^ having landed
76676 ^ at caesarea,
76678 ^ having gone up
76679 ^ and
76680 ^ having greeted
76681 ^ the church,
76683 ^ he went down
76684 ^ to antioch.
76686 ^ and
76687 ^ having stayed
76688 ^ time some,
76690 ^ he went forth,
76691 ^ passing through
76692 ^ successively
76693 ^ the galatian region
76696 ^ and phrygia,
76698 ^ strengthening
76699 ^ all the disciples.
76702 ^ a jew
76703 ^ now
76704 ^ certain,
76705 ^ apollos named,
76707 ^ of alexandria
76708 ^ - a native,
76710 ^ a man eloquent,
76712 ^ came
76713 ^ to ephesus,
76715 ^ mighty
76716 ^ being
76717 ^ in the scriptures.
76720 ^ he
76721 ^ was
76722 ^ instructed in
76723 ^ the way
76725 ^ of the lord.
76727 ^ and
76728 ^ being fervent
76729 ^ - in spirit,
76731 ^ he was speaking
76732 ^ and
76733 ^ was teaching
76734 ^ earnestly
76735 ^ the things
76736 ^ concerning - jesus,
76739 ^ knowing
76740 ^ only
76741 ^ the baptism of john.
76744 ^ he
76745 ^ then
76746 ^ began
76747 ^ to speak boldly
76748 ^ in the synagogue.
76751 ^ having heard
76752 ^ however
76753 ^ him
76754 ^ priscilla
76755 ^ and aquila,
76757 ^ they took to [them]
76758 ^ him
76759 ^ and
76760 ^ more accurately
76761 ^ to him
76762 ^ expounded
76763 ^ the way
76765 ^ of god.
76767 ^ resolving
76768 ^ then
76769 ^ he
76770 ^ to pass through
76771 ^ into - achaia,
76774 ^ having encouraged [him],
76775 ^ the brothers
76777 ^ wrote
76778 ^ to the disciples
76780 ^ to welcome
76781 ^ him,
76782 ^ who
76783 ^ having arrived,
76784 ^ helped
76785 ^ greatly
76786 ^ those having believed
76788 ^ through - grace.
76791 ^ powerfully
76792 ^ for
76793 ^ the jews
76795 ^ he was refuting
76796 ^ publicly,
76797 ^ showing
76798 ^ by the scriptures
76801 ^ to be
76802 ^ the christ
76804 ^ jesus.
76805 ^ it came to pass
76806 ^ now,
76807 ^ while -
76809 ^ - apollos
76811 ^ was
76812 ^ in corinth,
76814 ^ paul
76815 ^ having passed through
76816 ^ the upper parts
76819 ^ to come down
76820 ^ to ephesus,
76822 ^ and
76823 ^ having found
76824 ^ certain disciples,
76826 ^ he said
76827 ^ also
76828 ^ to them,
76830 ^ if
76831 ^ [the] spirit holy
76833 ^ did you receive,
76834 ^ having believed?
76835 ^ -
76836 ^ and [they said]
76837 ^ to him,
76839 ^ but
76840 ^ not even
76841 ^ that [a]
76842 ^ spirit holy
76844 ^ there is,
76845 ^ did we hear.
76846 ^ he said
76847 ^ then,
76848 ^ into what
76850 ^ then
76851 ^ were you baptized?
76852 ^ -
76853 ^ and
76854 ^ they said,
76855 ^ into - john's baptism.
76859 ^ said
76860 ^ then
76861 ^ paul,
76862 ^ john
76863 ^ baptized
76864 ^ a baptism of repentance,
76866 ^ the people
76868 ^ telling

76874 ^ that
76875 ^ they should believe,
76876 ^ that
76877 ^ is,
76878 ^ in - jesus.
76881 ^ having heard
76882 ^ then,

76954 ^ reasoning
76955 ^ in the lecture hall of tyrannus.
76959 ^ this
76960 ^ then
76961 ^ continued
76962 ^ for years two,

76985 ^ - god
76987 ^ was performing
76988 ^ by the hands of paul,

77096 ^ and wounded
77098 ^ they fled
77099 ^ out of the house that.
77103 ^ this
77104 ^ now

77129 ^ many
77130 ^ then
77131 ^ of those having believed

77248 ^ having brought together,
77249 ^ also
77250 ^ the
77251 ^ in such things workmen,

77278 ^ - of asia,
77280 ^ - paul, this
77283 ^ having persuaded [them],

77288 ^ that
77289 ^ not
77290 ^ they are
77291 ^ gods
77292 ^ -
77293 ^ by hands

77298 ^ but
77299 ^ this
77300 ^ is endangered
77301 ^ to us, the business
77304 ^ into disrepute
77306 ^ to come,
77307 ^ but
77308 ^ also
77309 ^ the
77310 ^ of the great goddess artemis temple
77315 ^ for nothing
77317 ^ to be reckoned,
77318 ^ to be
77319 ^ and
77320 ^ also
77321 ^ deposed
77322 ^ the majesty
77324 ^ of her,
77325 ^ whom
77326 ^ all - asia
77329 ^ and the world
77332 ^ worship.
77333 ^ having heard
77334 ^ then
77335 ^ and
77336 ^ having become
77337 ^ full of rage,
77339 ^ they were crying out,
77340 ^ saying,
77341 ^ great [is]
77342 ^ - artemis of [the] ephesians.
77345 ^ and
77346 ^ was filled
77347 ^ the city
77349 ^ whole with confusion;
77351 ^ they rushed
77352 ^ and
77353 ^ with one accord
77354 ^ to the theatre,
77357 ^ having dragged off
77358 ^ gaius
77359 ^ and aristarchus,
77361 ^ macedonians,
77362 ^ fellow travelers of paul.
77364 ^ of paul
77365 ^ however
77366 ^ intending
77367 ^ to go in
77368 ^ to the people,
77371 ^ not
77372 ^ would allow
77373 ^ him
77374 ^ the disciples.
77376 ^ some
77377 ^ then
77378 ^ also
77379 ^ of the asiarchs,
77381 ^ being
77382 ^ to him friends,
77384 ^ having sent
77385 ^ to him,
77387 ^ were urging [him]
77388 ^ not
77389 ^ to venture
77390 ^ himself
77391 ^ into the theatre.
77394 ^ others
77395 ^ indeed

77400 ^ was
77401 ^ for
77402 ^ the assembly
77404 ^ confused,
77405 ^ and
77406 ^ - most
77408 ^ not
77409 ^ did know
77410 ^ for what cause
77412 ^ they were assembled.
77413 ^ out of
77414 ^ now
77415 ^ the crowd
77417 ^ to explain himself
77418 ^ alexander,
77419 ^ having thrust forward
77420 ^ him
77421 ^ the jews.
77423 ^ -
77424 ^ and
77425 ^ alexander,
77426 ^ having motioned with
77427 ^ the hand,
77429 ^ was wanting
77430 ^ to make a defense
77431 ^ to the people.
77433 ^ having recognized
77434 ^ however
77435 ^ that
77436 ^ a jew
77437 ^ he is,
77438 ^ a cry
77439 ^ there was
77440 ^ one
77441 ^ from all,
77443 ^ about ongoing hours two
77447 ^ crying out,
77448 ^ great [is]
77449 ^ - artemis of [the] ephesians.
77452 ^ having calmed
77453 ^ then
77454 ^ the town clerk
77456 ^ the crowd,
77458 ^ he says,
77459 ^ men,
77460 ^ ephesians,
77461 ^ what
77462 ^ for
77463 ^ is there
77464 ^ man
77465 ^ who
77466 ^ not
77467 ^ knows
77468 ^ the of [the] ephesians city
77471 ^ temple-keeper
77472 ^ as being
77473 ^ of the great artemis,
77476 ^ and of that fallen from the sky?
77479 ^ undeniable
77480 ^ therefore
77481 ^ being
77482 ^ these things,
77483 ^ necessary
77484 ^ it is
77485 ^ for you
77486 ^ calm
77487 ^ to be,
77488 ^ and
77489 ^ nothing rash
77491 ^ to do.
77492 ^ you brought
77493 ^ for
77494 ^ the men
77496 ^ these,
77497 ^ neither temple plunderers
77499 ^ nor blaspheming
77501 ^ the goddess of us.
77504 ^ if
77505 ^ indeed
77506 ^ therefore
77507 ^ demetrius
77508 ^ and the
77510 ^ with him craftsmen
77513 ^ have
77514 ^ against anyone
77516 ^ a matter,
77517 ^ courts
77518 ^ are conducted,
77519 ^ and
77520 ^ proconsuls
77521 ^ there are;
77522 ^ let them accuse
77523 ^ one another.
77524 ^ if
77525 ^ however
77526 ^ anything
77527 ^ beyond this
77528 ^ you inquire,
77529 ^ in the lawful assembly
77533 ^ it will be solved.
77534 ^ and
77535 ^ for
77536 ^ we are in danger of
77537 ^ being accused
77538 ^ of insurrection
77539 ^ in regard to - this day,
77542 ^ not one cause
77544 ^ there existing
77545 ^ concerning which
77547 ^ not
77548 ^ we will be able
77549 ^ to give
77550 ^ a reason
77551 ^ for the commotion this.
77555 ^ and
77556 ^ these things
77557 ^ having said,
77558 ^ he dismissed
77559 ^ the assembly.
77561 ^ after
77562 ^ now
77563 ^ - had ceased
77565 ^ the uproar,
77567 ^ having called to [him]
77568 ^ - paul
77570 ^ the disciples
77572 ^ and
77573 ^ having encouraged,
77574 ^ having said farewell,
77575 ^ he departed
77576 ^ to go
77577 ^ to macedonia.
77579 ^ having passed through
77580 ^ then
77581 ^ the districts those,
77584 ^ and
77585 ^ having exhorted
77586 ^ them
77587 ^ with talk much,
77589 ^ he came
77590 ^ to - greece.
77593 ^ having continued
77594 ^ then
77595 ^ months three,
77597 ^ having been made
77598 ^ a plot against him
77600 ^ by the jews,
77603 ^ he being about
77604 ^ to sail
77605 ^ into - syria,
77608 ^ arose
77609 ^ a purpose
77610 ^ - to return

77639 ^ us
77640 ^ in troas.
77642 ^ we
77643 ^ then
77644 ^ sailed away
77645 ^ after the days
77648 ^ of the unleavened bread,
77650 ^ from philippi,
77652 ^ and
77653 ^ we came
77654 ^ to them
77656 ^ at - troas
77659 ^ within days five,
77662 ^ where
77663 ^ we stayed

77702 ^ a certain
77703 ^ young man
77704 ^ named eutychus
77706 ^ by the window,
77709 ^ overpowered
77710 ^ by sleep deep
77712 ^ as talked
77713 ^ - paul
77715 ^ on longer;
77717 ^ having been overpowered
77718 ^ by the sleep,
77721 ^ he fell
77722 ^ from the third story
77725 ^ down,
77726 ^ and
77727 ^ was picked up

77733 ^ fell upon
77734 ^ him,
77735 ^ and

78299 ^ - to paul
78301 ^ kept telling

78333 ^ on the shore,
78336 ^ having prayed,
78337 ^ having said farewell

78339 ^ then
78340 ^ we went up

78345 ^ then
78346 ^ returned
78347 ^ to the own.
78350 ^ we
78351 ^ then,
78352 ^ the voyage

78355 ^ from tyre,
78357 ^ came down
78358 ^ to ptolemais,
78360 ^ and
78361 ^ having greeted
78362 ^ the brothers,
78364 ^ we stayed

78378 ^ into the house
78381 ^ of philip
78382 ^ the evangelist,
78384 ^ being
78385 ^ of the seven,
78388 ^ we stayed
78389 ^ with him.

78393 ^ there were
78394 ^ daughters
78395 ^ four, virgins,

78398 ^ remaining
78399 ^ now

78418 ^ - of paul,
78420 ^ having bound
78421 ^ of himself the feet
78424 ^ and the hands,
78427 ^ he said,
78428 ^ thus
78429 ^ says
78430 ^ the spirit
78432 ^ - holy,
78434 ^ the man
78436 ^ of whom

78445 ^ the jews
78447 ^ and
78448 ^ will deliver [him]
78449 ^ into [the] hands of [the] gentiles.
78452 ^ when
78453 ^ then
78454 ^ we had heard
78455 ^ these things,
78456 ^ began begging
78457 ^ we both
78459 ^ and those of that place,
78462 ^ -
78463 ^ not
78464 ^ to go up
78465 ^ him
78466 ^ to jerusalem.
78468 ^ then
78469 ^ answered
78470 ^ - paul,
78472 ^ what
78473 ^ are you doing,
78474 ^ weeping
78475 ^ and

78500 ^ then
78501 ^ of him,
78502 ^ we were silent,
78503 ^ having said,
78504 ^ of the lord the will
78508 ^ be done.
78509 ^ after
78510 ^ now
78511 ^ the days these,
78514 ^ having packed the baggage,
78515 ^ we started on our way up
78516 ^ to jerusalem.

78559 ^ the elders.
78561 ^ and
78562 ^ having greeted
78563 ^ them,
78564 ^ he began to relate,

78568 ^ the things
78569 ^ had done
78570 ^ - god
78572 ^ among the gentiles
78575 ^ through the ministry of him.
78579 ^ those
78580 ^ then
78581 ^ having heard
78582 ^ began glorifying
78583 ^ - god.
78585 ^ they said
78586 ^ then
78587 ^ to him,
78588 ^ you see,
78589 ^ brother,
78590 ^ how many myriads
78592 ^ there are

78610 ^ you teach,
78611 ^ from moses,
78613 ^ those
78614 ^ among the gentiles all jews,

78620 ^ not
78621 ^ to circumcise
78622 ^ them
78623 ^ the children,
78625 ^ nor
78626 ^ in the customs
78628 ^ to walk.
78629 ^ what
78630 ^ then
78631 ^ is it?
78632 ^ certainly
78633 ^ they will hear
78634 ^ that
78635 ^ you have come.
78636 ^ this
78637 ^ therefore
78638 ^ do you
78639 ^ what
78640 ^ to you
78641 ^ we say.
78642 ^ there are
78643 ^ with us men four,
78646 ^ a vow
78647 ^ having
78648 ^ on themselves.
78650 ^ these [men]
78651 ^ having taken,
78652 ^ be purified
78653 ^ with them
78655 ^ and
78656 ^ bear expense
78657 ^ for them,
78659 ^ so that
78660 ^ they will shave
78661 ^ the head,
78663 ^ and
78664 ^ will know
78665 ^ all
78666 ^ that
78667 ^ of which
78668 ^ they have been informed
78669 ^ about you nothing
78672 ^ is,
78673 ^ but
78674 ^ you walk orderly
78675 ^ also

78678 ^ the law.
78680 ^ concerning
78681 ^ now
78682 ^ those
78683 ^ having believed of the gentiles,
78685 ^ we
78686 ^ wrote,

78690 ^ the things both sacrificed to idols,
78693 ^ and blood,

78720 ^ of the purification
78722 ^ until that
78724 ^ was offered
78725 ^ for one
78727 ^ each of them
78729 ^ the sacrifice.
78731 ^ when

78734 ^ the seven days
78737 ^ to be completed,
78738 ^ the
78739 ^ from - asia jews,
78743 ^ having seen
78744 ^ him
78745 ^ in the temple,
78748 ^ began stirring up
78749 ^ all the crowd
78752 ^ and
78753 ^ laid

78814 ^ was thrown into commotion
78815 ^ also
78816 ^ the city whole,
78819 ^ and
78820 ^ there was
78821 ^ a rushing together
78822 ^ of the people.
78824 ^ and
78825 ^ having laid hold
78826 ^ - of paul,
78828 ^ they dragged
78829 ^ him
78830 ^ outside the temple,
78833 ^ and
78834 ^ immediately
78835 ^ were shut
78836 ^ the doors.

79755 ^ a clamor great,
79757 ^ and
79758 ^ having risen up
79759 ^ some
79760 ^ of the scribes
79762 ^ of the party
79764 ^ of the pharisees,
79766 ^ they were contending,
79767 ^ saying,
79768 ^ nothing evil
79770 ^ we find
79771 ^ in the man this.
79775 ^ what if
79776 ^ now
79777 ^ a spirit
79778 ^ has spoken
79779 ^ to him,
79780 ^ or
79781 ^ an angel?
79782 ^ great
79783 ^ then
79784 ^ arising
79785 ^ dissension,
79786 ^ having feared
79787 ^ the commander,
79789 ^ lest
79790 ^ should be torn to pieces
79791 ^ - paul
79793 ^ by them,
79795 ^ he commanded
79796 ^ the troop,
79798 ^ having gone down,
79799 ^ to take by force
79800 ^ him
79801 ^ from midst of them,
79804 ^ to bring [him]
79805 ^ then
79806 ^ into the barracks.
79809 ^ -
79810 ^ but
79811 ^ the following night,
79813 ^ having stood by
79814 ^ him,
79815 ^ the lord
79817 ^ said,
79818 ^ take courage,
79819 ^ as
79820 ^ for
79821 ^ you have fully testified
79822 ^ -
79823 ^ about me

79833 ^ to testify.
79834 ^ when it was

79837 ^ having made
79838 ^ a conspiracy,
79839 ^ the jews
79841 ^ put under an oath

79843 ^ declaring
79844 ^ neither
79845 ^ to eat
79846 ^ nor
79847 ^ to drink
79848 ^ until that

79851 ^ - paul.
79853 ^ there were
79854 ^ now
79855 ^ more than forty,
79857 ^ -
79858 ^ this - plot
79861 ^ having made,
79862 ^ who,
79863 ^ having come
79864 ^ to the chief priests
79866 ^ and the elders,
79869 ^ said,
79870 ^ with an oath
79871 ^ we have bound

79873 ^ nothing
79874 ^ to eat
79875 ^ until that
79877 ^ we should kill
79878 ^ - paul.
79880 ^ now
79881 ^ therefore
79882 ^ you,
79883 ^ make a report
79884 ^ to the commander
79886 ^ along with the council,
79889 ^ so that
79890 ^ he might bring down
79891 ^ him
79892 ^ to you,
79894 ^ as
79895 ^ being about
79896 ^ to examine
79897 ^ more earnestly
79898 ^ the things
79899 ^ about him;
79901 ^ we
79902 ^ then,

79927 ^ he reported [it]
79928 ^ - to paul.
79930 ^ having called to [him]
79931 ^ then
79932 ^ - paul
79934 ^ one
79935 ^ of the centurions,
79937 ^ he was saying,
79938 ^ the young man this

79942 ^ to the commander;
79945 ^ he has
79946 ^ for
79947 ^ to report
79948 ^ something
79949 ^ to him.
79950 ^ the [one]

79955 ^ brought [him]
79956 ^ to the commander,
79959 ^ and
79960 ^ he says,
79961 ^ the prisoner paul,

79977 ^ having taken hold
79978 ^ then
79979 ^ the hand of him
79982 ^ the commander,
79984 ^ and
79985 ^ having withdrawn
79986 ^ in private,
79988 ^ he began to inquire,
79989 ^ what
79990 ^ is it
79991 ^ that
79992 ^ you have
79993 ^ to report
79994 ^ to me?
79995 ^ he said
79996 ^ then
79997 ^ -,
79998 ^ the jews
80000 ^ have agreed

80022 ^ should be persuaded
80023 ^ by them.
80024 ^ lie in wait
80025 ^ indeed
80026 ^ for him
80027 ^ of them men
80030 ^ more than forty,
80032 ^ who
80033 ^ have put under an oath

80704 ^ however
80705 ^ having been completed,
80706 ^ received [as]
80707 ^ successor
80708 ^ - felix,
80710 ^ porcius festus;
80712 ^ wishing
80713 ^ then
80714 ^ favor
80715 ^ to acquire for himself
80716 ^ with the jews,
80718 ^ - felix
80720 ^ left
80721 ^ - paul
80723 ^ imprisoned.
80724 ^ festus
80725 ^ therefore
80726 ^ having arrived in
80727 ^ the province,
80729 ^ after three days
80732 ^ he went up
80733 ^ to jerusalem
80735 ^ from caesarea.
80737 ^ made a presentation before
80738 ^ then
80739 ^ him
80740 ^ the chief priests
80742 ^ and the chiefs
80745 ^ of the jews,
80747 ^ against - paul,
80750 ^ and
80751 ^ they were begging
80752 ^ him,
80753 ^ asking
80754 ^ a favor
80755 ^ against him,
80757 ^ that
80758 ^ he would summon
80759 ^ him
80760 ^ to jerusalem,
80762 ^ an ambush
80763 ^ forming
80764 ^ to kill
80765 ^ him
80766 ^ on the way.
80769 ^ -
80770 ^ indeed
80771 ^ therefore
80772 ^ festus
80773 ^ answered that
80774 ^ is to be kept
80775 ^ - paul
80777 ^ in caesarea;
80779 ^ he himself
80780 ^ now
80781 ^ is about
80782 ^ in quickness
80784 ^ to set out.
80785 ^ those
80786 ^ therefore
80787 ^ among you,
80789 ^ he says, [those] in power,
80791 ^ having gone down too,
80792 ^ if
80793 ^ anything
80794 ^ there is
80795 ^ in the man
80798 ^ wrong,
80799 ^ let them accuse
80800 ^ him.
80801 ^ having spent
80802 ^ then
80803 ^ with them
80805 ^ days
80806 ^ not more than
80808 ^ eight
80809 ^ or ten,
80811 ^ having gone down
80812 ^ to caesarea,
80814 ^ on the next day
80816 ^ having sat
80817 ^ on the judgment seat,
80820 ^ he commanded
80821 ^ - paul
80823 ^ to be brought.
80824 ^ having arrived
80825 ^ then
80826 ^ he,
80827 ^ stood around

80829 ^ the
80830 ^ from jerusalem
80832 ^ having come down jews,
80834 ^ many
80835 ^ and weighty charges
80838 ^ bringing,
80839 ^ which
80840 ^ not
80841 ^ they were able
80842 ^ to prove.
80843 ^ - paul
80845 ^ made his defense
80846 ^ -:
80847 ^ neither against the law
80851 ^ of the jews,
80853 ^ nor against the temple,
80857 ^ nor against caesar,
80860 ^ [in] anything
80861 ^ have i sinned.
80862 ^ - festus
80864 ^ however,
80865 ^ wishing
80866 ^ on the jews
80868 ^ a favor
80869 ^ to lay,
80870 ^ answering
80871 ^ - paul,
80873 ^ said,
80874 ^ are you willing
80875 ^ to jerusalem
80877 ^ having gone up,
80878 ^ there
80879 ^ concerning these things
80881 ^ to be judged
80882 ^ before me?
80884 ^ said
80885 ^ then
80886 ^ - paul,
80888 ^ before the judgment seat of caesar
80892 ^ standing
80893 ^ i am,
80894 ^ where
80895 ^ me
80896 ^ it behooves
80897 ^ to be judged.
80898 ^ to [the] jews
80899 ^ nothing
80900 ^ i have done wrong,
80901 ^ as
80902 ^ also
80903 ^ you
80904 ^ very well
80905 ^ know.
80906 ^ if
80907 ^ indeed
80908 ^ therefore
80909 ^ i do wrong,
80910 ^ and
80911 ^ worthy of death

80914 ^ anything,
80915 ^ not
80916 ^ i do refuse
80917 ^ - to die.
80919 ^ if
80920 ^ however
80921 ^ nothing
80922 ^ there is
80923 ^ of which
80924 ^ they
80925 ^ [can] accuse
80926 ^ me,
80927 ^ no one
80928 ^ me
80929 ^ can
80930 ^ to them
80931 ^ give up.
80932 ^ to caesar
80933 ^ i appeal!
80934 ^ then
80935 ^ - festus,
80937 ^ having conferred
80938 ^ with the council,
80941 ^ answered,
80942 ^ to caesar
80943 ^ you have appealed;
80944 ^ to caesar
80946 ^ you will go!
80947 ^ days
80948 ^ now
80949 ^ having passed
80950 ^ some,
80951 ^ agrippa
80952 ^ the king
80954 ^ and bernice
80956 ^ came down
80957 ^ to caesarea,
80959 ^ greeting
80960 ^ - festus.
80962 ^ as
80963 ^ now
80964 ^ many days
80966 ^ they stayed
80967 ^ there,
80968 ^ - festus,
80970 ^ the king
80972 ^ laid before,
80973 ^ the things
80974 ^ relating to - paul,
80977 ^ saying,
80978 ^ a man certain
80980 ^ there is
80981 ^ left
80982 ^ by felix
80984 ^ [as] a prisoner,
80985 ^ concerning whom,
80987 ^ having been
80988 ^ my
80989 ^ in jerusalem,
80991 ^ made a presentation
80992 ^ the chief priests
80994 ^ and the elders
80997 ^ of the jews,
80999 ^ asking
81000 ^ against him
81002 ^ judgment,
81003 ^ to whom
81005 ^ i answered
81006 ^ that
81007 ^ not
81008 ^ it is
81009 ^ [the] custom with romans
81011 ^ to give up
81012 ^ any man
81014 ^ before that
81016 ^ the [one] being accused
81018 ^ to face
81020 ^ may have [it]
81021 ^ the accusers
81023 ^ [the] opportunity,
81024 ^ and
81025 ^ of defense
81026 ^ he may have
81027 ^ concerning the accusation.
81030 ^ having come together
81031 ^ therefore
81032 ^ of them
81033 ^ here,
81034 ^ delay no
81036 ^ having made,
81037 ^ the next [day]
81039 ^ having sat
81040 ^ on the judgment seat,
81043 ^ i commanded
81044 ^ to be brought
81045 ^ the man,
81047 ^ concerning whom,
81049 ^ having stood up,
81050 ^ the accusers
81052 ^ no charge
81054 ^ were bringing
81055 ^ of which
81056 ^ i
81057 ^ was expecting crimes.
81059 ^ questions
81060 ^ however
81061 ^ certain
81062 ^ concerning the own religion
81066 ^ they had
81067 ^ against him,
81069 ^ and concerning a certain jesus
81073 ^ having been dead,
81074 ^ whom
81075 ^ was affirming
81076 ^ - paul
81078 ^ to be alive.
81079 ^ being perplexed
81080 ^ now,
81081 ^ i
81082 ^ -
81083 ^ concerning this inquiry
81086 ^ was asking
81087 ^ if
81088 ^ he was willing
81089 ^ to go
81090 ^ to jerusalem
81092 ^ and there
81093 ^ to be judged
81094 ^ concerning these things.
81096 ^ -
81097 ^ but
81098 ^ of paul
81099 ^ having appealed for
81100 ^ to be kept
81101 ^ himself
81102 ^ for the
81104 ^ - emperor's decision,
81107 ^ i commanded
81108 ^ to be kept
81109 ^ him
81110 ^ until that
81112 ^ i might send
81113 ^ him
81114 ^ to caesar.
81116 ^ agrippa
81117 ^ then
81118 ^ [said] to - festus,
81121 ^ i have been wanting
81122 ^ also
81123 ^ myself
81124 ^ the man
81126 ^ to hear.
81127 ^ tomorrow,
81128 ^ he says,
81129 ^ you will hear
81130 ^ him.
81131 ^ on the
81132 ^ therefore
81133 ^ next day,
81134 ^ having come
81135 ^ - agrippa
81137 ^ and - bernice
81140 ^ with great pomp,
81143 ^ and
81144 ^ having entered
81145 ^ into the audience hall,
81148 ^ with both [the] commanders
81151 ^ and men
81153 ^ -
81154 ^ in prominence
81156 ^ in the city,
81158 ^ and
81159 ^ having commanded
81160 ^ - festus,
81162 ^ was brought in
81163 ^ - paul.
81165 ^ and
81166 ^ says
81167 ^ - festus,
81169 ^ agrippa king,
81171 ^ and all the
81174 ^ being present with
81175 ^ us men,
81177 ^ you see
81178 ^ this one,
81179 ^ concerning whom
81181 ^ all the multitude
81184 ^ of the jews
81186 ^ pleaded
81187 ^ with me,
81188 ^ in both jerusalem
81191 ^ and here,
81193 ^ crying out [that]
81194 ^ not
81195 ^ he ought
81196 ^ of him
81197 ^ to live
81198 ^ no longer.
81199 ^ i
81200 ^ however,
81201 ^ having understood
81202 ^ nothing
81203 ^ worthy
81204 ^ him
81205 ^ of death
81206 ^ to have done,
81207 ^ himself
81208 ^ and
81209 ^ of this one
81210 ^ having appealed to
81211 ^ the emperor,
81213 ^ i determined
81214 ^ to send [him],
81215 ^ concerning whom,
81217 ^ definite anything
81219 ^ to write
81220 ^ to [my] lord,
81222 ^ not
81223 ^ i have.
81224 ^ therefore
81225 ^ i have brought
81226 ^ him
81227 ^ before you all,
81229 ^ and
81230 ^ especially before you,
81233 ^ king agrippa,
81235 ^ so that
81236 ^ the examination
81238 ^ having taken place,
81239 ^ i might have
81240 ^ something
81241 ^ to write.
81242 ^ absurd
81243 ^ for
81244 ^ to me
81245 ^ it seems
81246 ^ [in] sending
81247 ^ a prisoner,
81248 ^ not
81249 ^ also
81250 ^ the
81251 ^ against him charges
81254 ^ to specify.
81255 ^ agrippa
81256 ^ then
81257 ^ to - paul
81260 ^ was saying,
81261 ^ it is permitted
81262 ^ you
81263 ^ for yourself
81265 ^ to speak.
81266 ^ then
81267 ^ - paul,
81269 ^ having stretched out
81270 ^ the hand,
81272 ^ began his defense:
81273 ^ concerning all
81275 ^ of which
81276 ^ i am accused
81277 ^ by [the] jews,
81279 ^ king agrippa,
81281 ^ i esteem
81282 ^ myself
81283 ^ fortunate
81284 ^ before you,
81286 ^ being about
81287 ^ today
81288 ^ to defend myself.
81289 ^ especially
81290 ^ acquainted
81291 ^ being
81292 ^ you
81293 ^ with all the
81295 ^ of [the] jews
81297 ^ customs, and
81299 ^ also controversies;
81301 ^ therefore
81302 ^ i implore [you]
81303 ^ patiently
81304 ^ to hear
81305 ^ me.
81306 ^ the
81307 ^ indeed
81308 ^ then
81309 ^ manner of life of me,
81311 ^ which [is]
81312 ^ from youth,
81314 ^ -
81315 ^ from [its] beginning
81317 ^ having been
81318 ^ among the nation of me,
81322 ^ in also jerusalem,
81325 ^ know
81326 ^ all the jews,
81329 ^ knowing
81330 ^ me
81331 ^ from the first,
81332 ^ if
81333 ^ they would be willing
81334 ^ to testify,
81335 ^ that
81336 ^ according to the strictest sect
81340 ^ - of our religion
81343 ^ i lived [as]
81344 ^ a pharisee.
81345 ^ and
81346 ^ now
81347 ^ for [the] hope
81349 ^ of the
81350 ^ to the fathers of us promise
81355 ^ having been made
81356 ^ by - god,
81359 ^ i stand
81360 ^ being judged,
81361 ^ to which
81363 ^ the twelve tribes of us
81366 ^ in earnestness,
81368 ^ night
81369 ^ and day,
81371 ^ serving,
81372 ^ hope
81373 ^ to attain;
81374 ^ concerning which hope
81377 ^ i am accused
81378 ^ by the jews,
81380 ^ o king.
81381 ^ why
81382 ^ incredible
81383 ^ is it judged
81384 ^ by you
81386 ^ if
81387 ^ - god
81389 ^ [the] dead
81390 ^ raises?
81391 ^ i
81392 ^ indeed
81393 ^ therefore
81394 ^ thought
81395 ^ in myself
81396 ^ to the name
81399 ^ of jesus
81400 ^ - of nazareth,
81402 ^ i ought
81403 ^ many things contrary
81405 ^ to do,
81406 ^ which
81407 ^ also
81408 ^ i did
81409 ^ in jerusalem;
81411 ^ and
81412 ^ many also
81414 ^ of the saints
81416 ^ i
81417 ^ in prisons
81419 ^ locked up,
81420 ^ the
81421 ^ from the chief priests authority
81425 ^ having received;
81426 ^ being put to death
81427 ^ then
81428 ^ they,
81429 ^ i cast against [them]
81430 ^ a vote.
81431 ^ and
81432 ^ in all the synagogues,
81436 ^ often
81437 ^ punishing
81438 ^ them,
81439 ^ i was compelling [them]
81440 ^ to blaspheme.
81441 ^ exceedingly
81442 ^ then
81443 ^ being furious
81444 ^ against them,
81445 ^ i kept persecuting [them]
81446 ^ as far as
81447 ^ even
81448 ^ to - foreign cities,
81452 ^ during which,
81454 ^ journeying
81455 ^ to - damascus
81458 ^ with [the] authority
81460 ^ and commission
81462 ^ of
81463 ^ the chief priests,
81465 ^ day mid
81467 ^ on the road
81470 ^ i saw,
81471 ^ o king,
81472 ^ from heaven
81473 ^ above, the brightness
81476 ^ of the sun,
81478 ^ having shone around
81479 ^ me, a light;
81481 ^ and those
81483 ^ with me
81485 ^ journeying.
81486 ^ all
81487 ^ and
81488 ^ having fallen down
81489 ^ of us
81490 ^ to the ground,
81493 ^ i heard
81494 ^ a voice
81495 ^ saying
81496 ^ to me
81498 ^ in the hebrew language,
81501 ^ saul,
81502 ^ saul,
81503 ^ why
81504 ^ me
81505 ^ persecute you?
81506 ^ [it is] hard
81507 ^ for you
81508 ^ against [the] goads
81510 ^ to kick.
81511 ^ i
81512 ^ then
81513 ^ said,
81514 ^ who
81515 ^ are you,
81516 ^ lord?
81517 ^ -
81518 ^ and
81519 ^ the lord
81520 ^ said,
81521 ^ i
81522 ^ am
81523 ^ jesus,
81524 ^ whom
81525 ^ you
81526 ^ are persecuting.
81527 ^ but
81528 ^ rise up
81529 ^ and
81530 ^ stand
81531 ^ on the feet of you;
81535 ^ for this purpose
81537 ^ for
81538 ^ i have appeared
81539 ^ to you,
81540 ^ to appoint
81541 ^ you
81542 ^ a servant
81543 ^ and a witness
81545 ^ of that which
81546 ^ both
81547 ^ you have seen
81548 ^ of me,
81549 ^ of the things in which
81550 ^ then
81551 ^ i will appear
81552 ^ to you,
81553 ^ delivering
81554 ^ you
81555 ^ out from the people
81558 ^ and from the gentiles,
81562 ^ to whom
81564 ^ i
81565 ^ am sending
81566 ^ you,
81567 ^ to open
81568 ^ eyes of them,
81570 ^ that they may turn
81572 ^ from darkness
81574 ^ to light,
81576 ^ and
81577 ^ from the power
81579 ^ - of satan
81581 ^ to - god,
81584 ^ [that] may receive
81586 ^ they
81587 ^ forgiveness of sins
81589 ^ and [an] inheritance
81591 ^ among those having been sanctified
81594 ^ by faith
81595 ^ that [is]
81596 ^ in me.
81598 ^ so then,
81599 ^ o king agrippa,
81601 ^ not
81602 ^ i was
81603 ^ disobedient
81604 ^ to the heavenly vision,
81607 ^ but
81608 ^ to those
81609 ^ in damascus first, both
81613 ^ and jerusalem
81615 ^ all, and the region
81619 ^ - of judea,
81621 ^ and to the gentiles,
81624 ^ i kept declaring
81625 ^ to repent
81626 ^ and
81627 ^ to turn
81628 ^ to - god,
81631 ^ worthy
81632 ^ - of repentance works
81635 ^ doing.
81636 ^ on account of these things,
81638 ^ me
81639 ^ the jews
81640 ^ having seized
81641 ^ being
81642 ^ in the temple,
81645 ^ they were attempting
81646 ^ to kill.
81647 ^ help
81648 ^ therefore
81649 ^ having obtained
81650 ^ -
81651 ^ from - god
81654 ^ unto the day this,

81868 ^ to a centurion,

81890 ^ a macedonian of thessalonica.
81892 ^ the
81893 ^ then
81894 ^ next [day],

81898 ^ considerately
81899 ^ then
81900 ^ - julius,
81902 ^ - paul
81904 ^ having treated,

81910 ^ care
81911 ^ to receive.
81912 ^ and from there
81913 ^ having set sail,
81914 ^ we sailed under
81915 ^ - cyprus,
81917 ^ because of -
81919 ^ the winds

81922 ^ contrary.
81923 ^ -

81926 ^ -
81927 ^ along - cilicia
81930 ^ and pamphylia,
81932 ^ having sailed across [the sea],

81938 ^ and there,
81939 ^ having found
81940 ^ the centurion
81942 ^ a ship
81943 ^ of alexandria
81944 ^ sailing
81945 ^ to - italy,
81948 ^ he placed

81973 ^ with difficulty
81974 ^ and
81975 ^ coasting along

81977 ^ we came
81978 ^ to a place
81980 ^ certain
81981 ^ called
81982 ^ fair havens,
81984 ^ to which near
81986 ^ [the] city
81987 ^ was
81988 ^ of lasea.

81996 ^ dangerous
81997 ^ the voyage,
81999 ^ because of -
82001 ^ even
82002 ^ the fast
82004 ^ already
82005 ^ being over,
82006 ^ was admonishing [them]
82007 ^ - paul,
82009 ^ saying
82010 ^ to them,
82011 ^ men,
82012 ^ i understand
82013 ^ that
82014 ^ with disaster
82016 ^ and much loss,
82019 ^ not only of the cargo
82023 ^ and of the ship,
82026 ^ but also the lives of us,
82031 ^ is about
82032 ^ to be
82033 ^ the voyage.
82035 ^ -
82036 ^ but
82037 ^ the centurion
82038 ^ by the pilot
82040 ^ and the ship owner
82043 ^ rather
82044 ^ was persuaded,
82045 ^ than
82046 ^ by the things
82047 ^ by paul
82049 ^ spoken.
82050 ^ unsuitable
82051 ^ now
82052 ^ the harbor
82054 ^ being
82055 ^ to winter in,
82057 ^ the majority
82059 ^ reached
82060 ^ a decision
82061 ^ to set sail
82062 ^ from there,
82063 ^ if
82064 ^ somehow
82065 ^ they might be able,
82066 ^ having arrived
82067 ^ at phoenix,
82069 ^ to winter [there] —
82070 ^ a harbor
82071 ^ - of crete,
82073 ^ looking
82074 ^ toward [the] southwest
82076 ^ and toward [the] northwest.
82079 ^ having blown gently
82080 ^ now
82081 ^ a south wind,
82082 ^ having thought
82083 ^ the purpose
82085 ^ to have obtained,
82086 ^ having weighed [anchor],
82087 ^ very near
82088 ^ they began coasting along
82089 ^ - crete.
82091 ^ after not long
82094 ^ however,
82095 ^ there came
82096 ^ down from it
82098 ^ a wind
82099 ^ tempestuous,
82100 ^ - called
82102 ^ the northeaster.
82103 ^ having been caught
82104 ^ then
82105 ^ the ship,
82107 ^ and
82108 ^ not
82109 ^ being able
82110 ^ to face
82111 ^ to the wind,
82113 ^ having given way
82114 ^ we were driven along.
82115 ^ an island
82116 ^ then
82117 ^ certain
82118 ^ having run under,
82119 ^ called
82120 ^ cauda,
82121 ^ we were able
82122 ^ with difficulty
82123 ^ control
82124 ^ to gain
82125 ^ of the lifeboat,
82127 ^ which
82128 ^ having taken up,
82129 ^ supports
82130 ^ they began using,
82131 ^ undergirding
82132 ^ the ship.
82134 ^ fearing
82135 ^ then
82136 ^ lest
82137 ^ into the sandbars of syrtis
82140 ^ they should fall,
82141 ^ having lowered
82142 ^ the gear,
82144 ^ thus
82145 ^ they were driven along.
82146 ^ violently
82147 ^ now
82148 ^ being storm-tossed
82149 ^ of us,
82150 ^ on the next [day]
82152 ^ a jettison of cargo
82153 ^ they began to make,
82154 ^ and
82155 ^ on the third [day],
82157 ^ with [their] own hands
82158 ^ the tackle
82160 ^ of the ship
82162 ^ they cast away.
82163 ^ neither
82164 ^ now
82165 ^ sun
82166 ^ nor stars
82168 ^ appearing
82169 ^ for many days,

82173 ^ and
82174 ^ no small
82176 ^ lying on [us],
82177 ^ from then on
82178 ^ was abandoned
82179 ^ hope all
82181 ^ - being saved
82183 ^ of us.
82184 ^ much
82185 ^ also
82186 ^ time without food
82187 ^ there being,
82188 ^ at that time
82189 ^ having stood up
82190 ^ - paul
82192 ^ in midst of them,
82195 ^ he said,
82196 ^ it behooved [you]
82197 ^ indeed,
82198 ^ o men,
82200 ^ having been obedient
82201 ^ to me,
82202 ^ not
82203 ^ to have set sail
82204 ^ from - crete,
82207 ^ to have incurred
82208 ^ then
82209 ^ the disaster this
82212 ^ and - loss.
82215 ^ and yet
82216 ^ - now
82218 ^ i exhort
82219 ^ you
82220 ^ to keep up your courage;
82221 ^ loss
82222 ^ for
82223 ^ of life none
82225 ^ there will be
82226 ^ from among you,
82228 ^ only of the ship.
82231 ^ stood by
82232 ^ for
82233 ^ me
82234 ^ this - night
82237 ^ -, of god,
82239 ^ whose
82240 ^ am
82241 ^ i
82242 ^ whom
82243 ^ and
82244 ^ i serve, an angel,
82246 ^ saying,
82247 ^ not
82248 ^ fear,
82249 ^ paul;
82250 ^ caesar
82251 ^ you
82252 ^ it behooves
82253 ^ to stand before.
82254 ^ and
82255 ^ behold,
82256 ^ has granted
82257 ^ to you
82258 ^ - god
82260 ^ all those sailing
82263 ^ with you.
82265 ^ therefore
82266 ^ take courage,
82267 ^ men;
82268 ^ i believe
82269 ^ for
82270 ^ - god
82272 ^ that
82273 ^ thus
82274 ^ it will be,
82275 ^ according to the way
82278 ^ it has been said
82279 ^ to me.
82280 ^ upon an island
82282 ^ however
82283 ^ certain
82284 ^ it behooves
82285 ^ us
82286 ^ to fall.
82287 ^ when
82288 ^ then
82289 ^ the fourteenth night
82291 ^ had come,
82292 ^ being driven about
82293 ^ of us
82294 ^ in the adriatic,
82297 ^ toward [the] middle
82299 ^ of the night,
82301 ^ began sensing
82302 ^ the sailors
82304 ^ to be drawing near
82305 ^ some
82306 ^ to them
82307 ^ land.
82308 ^ and
82309 ^ having taken soundings,
82310 ^ they found
82311 ^ fathoms twenty.
82313 ^ a little
82314 ^ then
82315 ^ having gone farther
82316 ^ and
82317 ^ again
82318 ^ having taken soundings,
82319 ^ they found
82320 ^ fathoms fifteen.
82322 ^ fearing
82323 ^ then
82324 ^ lest
82325 ^ somewhere
82326 ^ on rocky places
82329 ^ we might fall,
82330 ^ out of [the] stern
82332 ^ having cast
82333 ^ anchors four,
82335 ^ they were praying for
82336 ^ day
82337 ^ to come.
82338 ^ of the
82339 ^ then
82340 ^ sailors
82341 ^ seeking
82342 ^ to flee
82343 ^ out of the ship
82346 ^ and
82347 ^ having let down
82348 ^ the lifeboat
82350 ^ into the sea
82353 ^ under pretense
82354 ^ as
82355 ^ from [the] bow
82357 ^ anchors
82358 ^ being about
82359 ^ to cast out,
82360 ^ said
82361 ^ - paul
82363 ^ to the centurion
82365 ^ and to the soldiers,
82368 ^ if
82369 ^ not
82370 ^ these
82371 ^ remain
82372 ^ in the ship,
82375 ^ you
82376 ^ to be saved
82377 ^ not
82378 ^ are able.
82379 ^ then
82380 ^ cut away
82381 ^ the soldiers
82383 ^ the ropes
82385 ^ of the lifeboat,
82387 ^ and
82388 ^ allowed
82389 ^ her
82390 ^ to fall away.
82391 ^ until
82392 ^ then
82393 ^ that
82394 ^ day
82395 ^ was about
82396 ^ to come,
82397 ^ kept urging
82398 ^ - paul
82400 ^ all
82401 ^ to partake
82402 ^ of food,
82403 ^ saying,
82404 ^ the fourteenth
82405 ^ today
82406 ^ [is] day
82407 ^ watching
82408 ^ without eating
82409 ^ you continue,
82410 ^ nothing
82411 ^ having taken.
82412 ^ therefore
82413 ^ i exhort
82414 ^ you
82415 ^ to take
82416 ^ food;
82417 ^ this
82418 ^ indeed
82419 ^ for - of you preservation
82423 ^ is;
82424 ^ not one
82425 ^ for
82426 ^ of you a hair
82428 ^ of the head
82431 ^ will perish.
82432 ^ having said
82433 ^ now
82434 ^ these things
82435 ^ and
82436 ^ having taken
82437 ^ bread,
82438 ^ he gave thanks
82439 ^ - to god
82441 ^ before all,
82443 ^ and
82444 ^ having broken [it],
82445 ^ he began
82446 ^ to eat.
82447 ^ encouraged
82448 ^ then
82449 ^ having been,
82450 ^ all
82451 ^ also
82452 ^ themselves
82453 ^ took
82454 ^ food.
82455 ^ we were
82456 ^ then
82457 ^ the altogether souls
82460 ^ in the ship,
82463 ^ two hundred
82464 ^ seventy
82465 ^ six.
82466 ^ having been filled
82467 ^ then
82468 ^ with food,
82469 ^ they began to lighten
82470 ^ the ship,
82472 ^ casting out
82473 ^ the wheat
82475 ^ into the sea.
82478 ^ when
82479 ^ now
82480 ^ day
82481 ^ it was,
82482 ^ the land
82484 ^ not
82485 ^ they did recognize;
82486 ^ a bay
82487 ^ however
82488 ^ certain
82489 ^ they noticed,
82490 ^ having
82491 ^ a shore,
82492 ^ on which
82494 ^ they determined,
82495 ^ if
82496 ^ they should be able,
82497 ^ to drive
82498 ^ the ship.
82500 ^ and
82501 ^ the anchors
82503 ^ having cut away,
82504 ^ they left [them]
82505 ^ in the sea,
82508 ^ at the same time
82509 ^ having loosened
82510 ^ the ropes
82512 ^ of the rudders.
82514 ^ and
82515 ^ having hoisted
82516 ^ the foresail
82518 ^ to the blowing [wind],
82520 ^ they began making
82521 ^ for the shore.
82524 ^ having fallen
82525 ^ however
82526 ^ into a place between two seas,
82529 ^ they ran aground
82530 ^ the vessel;
82532 ^ and
82533 ^ the
82534 ^ indeed
82535 ^ bow
82536 ^ having stuck fast,
82537 ^ it remained
82538 ^ immovable,
82539 ^ -
82540 ^ and
82541 ^ the stern
82542 ^ was being broken up
82543 ^ by the violence
82546 ^ of the waves.
82548 ^ of the
82549 ^ now
82550 ^ soldiers, [the] plan
82552 ^ was
82553 ^ that
82554 ^ the prisoners
82556 ^ they should kill,
82557 ^ lest
82558 ^ anyone,
82559 ^ having swum away,
82560 ^ should escape.
82561 ^ -
82562 ^ but
82563 ^ the centurion,
82564 ^ desiring
82565 ^ to save
82566 ^ - paul,
82568 ^ hindered
82569 ^ them
82570 ^ of [the] purpose;
82572 ^ he commanded
82573 ^ then
82574 ^ those being able
82576 ^ to swim,
82577 ^ having cast [themselves] off
82578 ^ first,
82579 ^ on the land
82582 ^ to go out,
82583 ^ and
82584 ^ the rest,
82586 ^ some
82587 ^ indeed
82588 ^ on boards,
82590 ^ some
82591 ^ then
82592 ^ on things
82594 ^ -
82595 ^ from the ship.
82598 ^ and
82599 ^ thus
82600 ^ it came to pass that
82601 ^ all
82602 ^ were brought safely
82603 ^ to the land.
82606 ^ and
82607 ^ having been saved,
82608 ^ then
82609 ^ we found out
82610 ^ that
82611 ^ malta
82612 ^ the island
82614 ^ is called.
82615 ^ -
82616 ^ and
82617 ^ the natives
82618 ^ were showing
82619 ^ not [just] the
82621 ^ ordinary kindness
82623 ^ to us.
82624 ^ having kindled
82625 ^ for
82626 ^ a fire,
82627 ^ they received
82628 ^ all of us
82630 ^ because of the rain
82633 ^ - coming on
82635 ^ and because of the cold.
82639 ^ having gathered
82640 ^ now
82641 ^ - paul
82643 ^ of sticks a quantity,
82646 ^ and
82647 ^ having laid [them]
82648 ^ on the fire,
82651 ^ a viper
82652 ^ out from the heat
82655 ^ having come,
82656 ^ fastened
82657 ^ on the hand of him.
82660 ^ when
82661 ^ then
82662 ^ saw
82663 ^ the natives
82665 ^ hanging the beast
82668 ^ from the hand of him,
82672 ^ to one another
82674 ^ they began to say,
82675 ^ by all means
82676 ^ a murderer
82677 ^ is
82678 ^ the man this,
82681 ^ whom
82682 ^ having been saved
82683 ^ from the sea,
82686 ^ - justice
82688 ^ to live
82689 ^ not
82690 ^ has permitted.
82691 ^ the [one]

82693 ^ then,
82694 ^ having shaken off
82695 ^ the creature
82697 ^ into the fire,
82700 ^ he suffered
82701 ^ no injury.
82703 ^ -
82704 ^ but
82705 ^ they were expecting
82706 ^ him
82707 ^ to be about
82708 ^ to become inflamed,
82709 ^ or
82710 ^ to fall down
82711 ^ suddenly
82712 ^ dead.
82713 ^ a while great
82715 ^ however
82716 ^ of them
82717 ^ waiting
82718 ^ and
82719 ^ seeing
82720 ^ nothing amiss
82722 ^ to him
82724 ^ happening,
82725 ^ having changed their opinion,
82726 ^ they began declaring
82727 ^ him
82728 ^ to be
82729 ^ a god.
82730 ^ in
82731 ^ now
82732 ^ the [parts]
82733 ^ around the place that
82737 ^ were
82738 ^ lands
82739 ^ belonging to the chief
82741 ^ of the island,
82743 ^ named publius,
82745 ^ who
82746 ^ having received
82747 ^ us
82748 ^ three, days
82750 ^ hospitably
82751 ^ entertained [us].
82752 ^ it came to pass
82753 ^ then,
82754 ^ the father
82756 ^ - of publius,
82758 ^ fevers
82759 ^ and dysentery
82761 ^ oppressed with,
82762 ^ was lying,
82763 ^ toward whom
82765 ^ - paul,
82767 ^ having entered
82768 ^ and
82769 ^ having prayed,
82770 ^ having laid
82771 ^ the hands
82773 ^ on him,
82774 ^ healed
82775 ^ him.
82776 ^ of this
82777 ^ then
82778 ^ having taken place,
82779 ^ also
82780 ^ the rest
82782 ^ -
82783 ^ in the island
82786 ^ having
82787 ^ infirmities
82788 ^ were coming
82789 ^ and
82790 ^ were healed,
82791 ^ who
82792 ^ also
82793 ^ with many honors
82795 ^ honored
82796 ^ us,
82797 ^ and
82798 ^ on setting sail,
82799 ^ they laid on [us]
82800 ^ the things
82801 ^ for the needs.
82804 ^ after
82805 ^ then
82806 ^ three months,
82808 ^ we sailed
82809 ^ in a ship
82811 ^ having wintered
82812 ^ in the island, alexandrian,
82816 ^ with a figurehead of the dioscuri.
82818 ^ and
82819 ^ having put in
82820 ^ at syracuse,
82822 ^ we stayed
82823 ^ days three,
82825 ^ from where
82826 ^ having gone around,
82827 ^ we arrived
82828 ^ at rhegium.
82830 ^ and
82831 ^ after one day,
82834 ^ having come on
82835 ^ a south wind,
82836 ^ on the second day
82837 ^ we came
82838 ^ to puteoli,
82840 ^ where
82841 ^ having found
82842 ^ [some] brothers,
82843 ^ we were entreated
82844 ^ with them
82846 ^ to remain
82847 ^ days seven.
82849 ^ and
82850 ^ so
82851 ^ to - rome
82854 ^ we came.
82855 ^ and from there
82856 ^ the brothers,
82858 ^ having heard
82859 ^ the things
82860 ^ concerning us,
82862 ^ came out
82863 ^ to meet us
82866 ^ as far as of appius [the] market
82869 ^ and [the] three taverns,
82872 ^ whom
82873 ^ having seen
82874 ^ - paul,
82876 ^ having given thanks
82877 ^ to god,
82879 ^ took
82880 ^ courage.
82881 ^ when
82882 ^ now
82883 ^ we came
82884 ^ to rome,
82886 ^ was allowed
82887 ^ - paul
82889 ^ to stay
82890 ^ by himself,
82892 ^ with the
82894 ^ guarding
82895 ^ him soldier.
82897 ^ it came to pass
82898 ^ then,
82899 ^ after days three
82902 ^ called together
82903 ^ he
82904 ^ those being
82906 ^ of the jews leaders.
82909 ^ having come together
82910 ^ then
82911 ^ of them,
82912 ^ he was saying
82913 ^ to them,
82915 ^ i,
82916 ^ men,
82917 ^ brothers,
82918 ^ nothing against
82920 ^ having done
82921 ^ the people
82923 ^ or the customs
82926 ^ - of our fathers,
82928 ^ a prisoner
82929 ^ from jerusalem
82931 ^ was delivered
82932 ^ into the hands
82935 ^ of the romans,
82937 ^ who
82938 ^ having examined
82939 ^ me,
82940 ^ were wanting
82941 ^ to let [me] go,
82942 ^ on account of -
82944 ^ not one cause of death
82947 ^ existing
82948 ^ in me.
82950 ^ objecting
82951 ^ however
82952 ^ of the jews,
82954 ^ i was compelled
82955 ^ to appeal to
82956 ^ caesar,
82957 ^ not
82958 ^ as
82959 ^ the nation of me
82962 ^ having
82963 ^ anything
82964 ^ to lay against.
82965 ^ for this
82967 ^ therefore
82968 ^ - cause
82970 ^ i have called
82971 ^ you,
82972 ^ to see
82973 ^ and
82974 ^ to speak to [you];
82975 ^ because of
82976 ^ for
82977 ^ the hope
82979 ^ - of israel,
82981 ^ the chain this
82984 ^ i have around [me].
82985 ^ -
82986 ^ and
82987 ^ to him
82989 ^ they said,
82990 ^ we
82991 ^ neither
82992 ^ letters
82993 ^ concerning you
82995 ^ received
82996 ^ from - judea,
82999 ^ nor
83000 ^ having arrived
83001 ^ any
83002 ^ of the brothers
83004 ^ reported
83005 ^ or
83006 ^ said
83007 ^ anything
83008 ^ concerning you evil.
83011 ^ we deem it worthy
83012 ^ however
83013 ^ from you
83015 ^ to hear
83016 ^ what
83017 ^ you think,
83018 ^ concerning
83019 ^ truly
83020 ^ for
83021 ^ the sect this,
83024 ^ known to us
83026 ^ it is
83027 ^ that
83028 ^ everywhere
83029 ^ it is spoken against.
83030 ^ having appointed
83031 ^ then
83032 ^ him
83033 ^ a day,
83034 ^ came
83035 ^ to him
83037 ^ to the lodging
83040 ^ many,
83041 ^ to whom
83042 ^ he expounded,
83043 ^ fully testifying
83044 ^ to the kingdom
83046 ^ - of god,
83048 ^ persuading
83049 ^ then
83050 ^ them
83051 ^ concerning - jesus
83054 ^ from both the law of moses
83059 ^ and the prophets,
83062 ^ from morning
83064 ^ to evening.
83066 ^ and
83067 ^ some
83068 ^ indeed
83069 ^ were persuaded of
83070 ^ the things he is speaking;
83072 ^ some
83073 ^ however
83074 ^ refused to believe.
83075 ^ discordant
83076 ^ then
83077 ^ being
83078 ^ with one another,
83080 ^ they began to leave,
83081 ^ having spoken
83082 ^ - paul
83084 ^ word one
83086 ^ -:
83087 ^ rightly
83088 ^ the spirit
83090 ^ - holy
83092 ^ spoke
83093 ^ by isaiah
83095 ^ the prophet
83097 ^ to the fathers of you,
83101 ^ saying:
83102 ^ go
83103 ^ to the people this
83107 ^ and
83108 ^ say,
83109 ^ in hearing
83110 ^ you will hear
83111 ^ and
83112 ^ no not
83114 ^ understand;
83115 ^ and
83116 ^ in seeing
83117 ^ you will see
83118 ^ and
83119 ^ no not
83121 ^ perceive.
83122 ^ has grown dull
83123 ^ for
83124 ^ the heart
83126 ^ of the people this,
83129 ^ and
83130 ^ with the ears
83132 ^ barely
83133 ^ they hear,
83134 ^ and
83135 ^ the eyes of them
83138 ^ they have closed,
83139 ^ lest ever
83140 ^ they should see
83141 ^ with the eyes,
83143 ^ and
83144 ^ with the ears
83146 ^ they should hear,
83147 ^ and
83148 ^ with the heart
83150 ^ they should understand,
83151 ^ and
83152 ^ should turn,
83153 ^ and
83154 ^ i will heal
83155 ^ them.’
83156 ^ known
83157 ^ therefore
83158 ^ be it
83159 ^ to you
83160 ^ that
83161 ^ to the gentiles

83164 ^ this - salvation
83167 ^ - of god;

83170 ^ then
83171 ^ will listen!”
83172 ^ he stayed
83173 ^ then
83174 ^ two years whole
83176 ^ in his own rented house,
83179 ^ and
83180 ^ was welcoming

83538 ^ they glorified [him],

83541 ^ but
83542 ^ they became futile

84982 ^ therefore

85113 ^ of us
85114 ^ without strength
85115 ^ still,
85116 ^ according to [the] right time,
85118 ^ for [the] ungodly
85120 ^ died.
85121 ^ rarely
85122 ^ indeed
85123 ^ for a righteous [man]
85125 ^ anyone
85126 ^ will die;
85127 ^ on behalf of
85128 ^ though
85129 ^ the good [man],

85132 ^ someone
85133 ^ even
85134 ^ would dare
85135 ^ to die.
85136 ^ demonstrates
85137 ^ however
85138 ^ the of himself love
85141 ^ to us
85143 ^ - god,
85145 ^ that
85146 ^ still

85148 ^ being
85149 ^ of us,
85150 ^ christ

85153 ^ died.
85154 ^ much
85155 ^ therefore
85156 ^ more,
85157 ^ having been justified
85158 ^ now
85159 ^ by the blood of him,
85163 ^ we will be saved
85164 ^ by him
85166 ^ from the wrath!
85169 ^ if
85170 ^ for,
85171 ^ enemies
85172 ^ being,
85173 ^ we were reconciled
85174 ^ - to god
85176 ^ through the death
85179 ^ of the son of him,
85182 ^ much more,
85184 ^ having been reconciled,
85185 ^ shall we be saved
85186 ^ in the life of him!
85190 ^ not
85191 ^ only [so]
85192 ^ now,
85193 ^ but
85194 ^ also
85195 ^ we are rejoicing

85203 ^ jesus christ,
85205 ^ through whom
85207 ^ now
85208 ^ the reconciliation
85210 ^ we have received.
85211 ^ because of this,
85213 ^ just as
85214 ^ through one man
85217 ^ - sin
85219 ^ into the world
85222 ^ entered,
85223 ^ and
85224 ^ through - sin,
85227 ^ - death;
85229 ^ also
85230 ^ thus
85231 ^ to all men
85234 ^ - death
85236 ^ passed,
85237 ^ for that
85239 ^ all
85240 ^ sinned.
85241 ^ until
85242 ^ for
85243 ^ [the] law,
85244 ^ sin
85245 ^ was
85246 ^ in [the] world;
85248 ^ sin
85249 ^ however
85250 ^ not
85251 ^ is imputed,
85252 ^ not
85253 ^ there being
85254 ^ law.
85255 ^ nevertheless
85256 ^ reigned
85257 ^ - death
85259 ^ from adam
85261 ^ until moses,
85263 ^ even
85264 ^ over those not having sinned
85268 ^ in the likeness
85271 ^ of the transgression of adam,
85274 ^ who
85275 ^ is
85276 ^ a type
85277 ^ of the coming [one].
85279 ^ but
85280 ^ [is] not
85281 ^ like the trespass
85284 ^ so
85285 ^ also
85286 ^ the gift.
85288 ^ if
85289 ^ for
85290 ^ by the
85291 ^ of the one trespass,
85294 ^ the many
85296 ^ died,
85297 ^ how much more
85299 ^ the grace
85301 ^ - of god
85303 ^ and the gift
85306 ^ in grace
85308 ^ which [is]
85309 ^ of the one man,
85312 ^ jesus christ,
85314 ^ to the many
85317 ^ did abound!
85318 ^ and
85319 ^ [is] not
85320 ^ as through one having sinned,
85324 ^ the gift.
85326 ^ the
85327 ^ truly
85328 ^ for
85329 ^ judgment [was],
85330 ^ of one
85332 ^ [was] unto condemnation;
85334 ^ -
85335 ^ but
85336 ^ the gift
85337 ^ [is] out of many trespasses,
85340 ^ unto justification.
85342 ^ if
85343 ^ for,
85344 ^ by the
85345 ^ of the one trespass,
85348 ^ - death
85350 ^ reigned
85351 ^ through the one,
85354 ^ how much more
85356 ^ those
85357 ^ the abundance
85359 ^ - of grace,
85361 ^ and of the gift
85364 ^ - of righteousness
85366 ^ receiving,
85367 ^ in life
85369 ^ will reign
85370 ^ through the one,
85373 ^ jesus christ!
85375 ^ so
85376 ^ then,
85377 ^ just as
85378 ^ by one trespass,
85381 ^ to all men
85384 ^ [it is] unto condemnation,
85386 ^ so
85387 ^ also
85388 ^ by one act of righteousness,
85391 ^ to all men
85394 ^ [it is] unto justification of life.
85397 ^ for as
85398 ^ for
85399 ^ through the disobedience
85402 ^ of the one man,
85405 ^ sinners
85406 ^ were made
85407 ^ the many,
85409 ^ so
85410 ^ also
85411 ^ through the obedience
85414 ^ of the one,
85416 ^ righteous
85417 ^ will be made
85418 ^ the many.
85420 ^ [the] law
85421 ^ now
85422 ^ entered,
85423 ^ so that
85424 ^ might abound
85425 ^ the trespass;
85427 ^ where
85428 ^ however
85429 ^ abounded
85430 ^ - sin,
85432 ^ overabounded
85433 ^ - grace,
85435 ^ so that
85436 ^ just as
85437 ^ reigned
85438 ^ the sin
85440 ^ in - death,
85443 ^ so
85444 ^ also
85445 ^ - grace
85447 ^ might reign
85448 ^ through righteousness,
85450 ^ unto life eternal,
85453 ^ through jesus
85455 ^ christ
85456 ^ the lord of us.
85459 ^ what
85460 ^ then
85461 ^ will we say?
85462 ^ shall we continue
85463 ^ - in sin,
85465 ^ that
85466 ^ - grace
85468 ^ may abound?
85469 ^ never
85470 ^ may it be!
85471 ^ who
85472 ^ we died
85473 ^ - to sin,
85475 ^ how
85476 ^ still
85477 ^ shall we live
85478 ^ in it?
85480 ^ or
85481 ^ are you unaware
85482 ^ that
85483 ^ as many as
85484 ^ have been baptized
85485 ^ into christ jesus,
85488 ^ into the death of him
85492 ^ have been baptized?
85493 ^ we were buried
85494 ^ therefore
85495 ^ with him
85496 ^ through - baptism
85499 ^ into - death,
85502 ^ so that
85503 ^ just as
85504 ^ was raised up
85505 ^ christ
85506 ^ out from [the] dead
85508 ^ by the glory
85511 ^ of the father,
85513 ^ so
85514 ^ also
85515 ^ we
85516 ^ in newness of life
85519 ^ should walk.
85520 ^ if
85521 ^ for
85522 ^ united
85523 ^ we have become
85524 ^ in the likeness
85526 ^ of the death of him,
85529 ^ certainly
85530 ^ also
85531 ^ of the resurrection
85533 ^ we will be;
85534 ^ this
85535 ^ knowing,
85536 ^ that
85537 ^ - old of us self
85541 ^ was crucified with [him],
85542 ^ so that
85543 ^ might be annulled
85544 ^ the body
85546 ^ - of sin,
85548 ^ [that]
85549 ^ no longer

85552 ^ - to sin.
85554 ^ the [one]

85556 ^ having died
85557 ^ has been freed
85558 ^ from - sin.
85561 ^ if
85562 ^ now
85563 ^ we died
85564 ^ with christ,
85566 ^ we believe
85567 ^ that
85568 ^ also
85569 ^ we will live with
85570 ^ him,

87778 ^ isaiah

87859 ^ the prophets of you
87862 ^ they have killed;
87863 ^ the altars of you
87866 ^ they have torn down;
87867 ^ and i
87868 ^ have been left
87869 ^ alone,
87870 ^ and
87871 ^ they are seeking
87872 ^ the life of me.”
87875 ^ but
87876 ^ what [was]
87877 ^ spoken
87878 ^ to him
87879 ^ the divine answer?
87881 ^ i have left
87882 ^ to myself
87883 ^ seven thousand men
87885 ^ who
87886 ^ not
87887 ^ have bowed
87888 ^ [the] knee
87889 ^ - to baal.”
87891 ^ thus
87892 ^ then
87893 ^ also,
87894 ^ in the present time,
87898 ^ a remnant
87899 ^ according to [the] election of grace
87902 ^ there has been.
87903 ^ if
87904 ^ now
87905 ^ by grace,
87906 ^ no longer
87907 ^ from works;
87909 ^ otherwise
87910 ^ - grace
87912 ^ no longer
87913 ^ would be
87914 ^ grace.
87915 ^ what
87916 ^ then?
87917 ^ what
87918 ^ is seeking
87919 ^ israel,
87920 ^ this
87921 ^ not
87922 ^ it has obtained;
87923 ^ -
87924 ^ but
87925 ^ the elect
87926 ^ obtained [it].
87927 ^ the
87928 ^ now
87929 ^ rest
87930 ^ were hardened,
87931 ^ as
87932 ^ it has been written:
87933 ^ gave
87934 ^ them
87935 ^ - god
87937 ^ a spirit of stupor,
87939 ^ eyes
87940 ^ - not to see,
87943 ^ and

87948 ^ unto the today day.”
87952 ^ and
87953 ^ david
87954 ^ says:

87956 ^ the table of them
87959 ^ for a snare
87961 ^ and for a trap,
87964 ^ and for a stumbling block
87967 ^ and for a retribution
87970 ^ to them;
87971 ^ let be darkened
87972 ^ the eyes of them,
87975 ^ - not to see,
87978 ^ and
87979 ^ the backs of them,
87982 ^ for ever
87984 ^ bent over.”
87985 ^ i ask
87986 ^ then,
87987 ^ not
87988 ^ did they stumble
87989 ^ that
87990 ^ they might fall?
87991 ^ never
87992 ^ may it be!
87993 ^ but
87994 ^ in the of them trespass
87997 ^ - [is] salvation
87999 ^ to the gentiles,
88001 ^ so as - to provoke to jealousy
88004 ^ them.
88005 ^ if
88006 ^ however,
88007 ^ the trespass of them
88010 ^ [is] riches of [the] world,
88012 ^ and
88013 ^ the failure of them
88016 ^ [is the] riches of [the] gentiles,
88018 ^ how much more
88020 ^ the fullness of them!
88023 ^ to you
88024 ^ now
88025 ^ i am speaking,
88026 ^ the gentiles.
88028 ^ upon as much as
88030 ^ indeed
88031 ^ therefore
88032 ^ am
88033 ^ i
88034 ^ of [the] gentiles apostle,
88036 ^ the ministry of me
88039 ^ i magnify,
88040 ^ if
88041 ^ at all
88042 ^ i shall provoke to jealousy
88043 ^ of me the flesh,
88046 ^ and
88047 ^ shall save
88048 ^ some
88049 ^ of them.
88051 ^ if
88052 ^ for
88053 ^ the rejection of them
88056 ^ [is the] reconciliation of [the] world,
88058 ^ what [will be]
88059 ^ the acceptance,
88061 ^ if
88062 ^ not
88063 ^ life
88064 ^ out from [the] dead?

88125 ^ i
88126 ^ might be grafted in.
88127 ^ rightly so;
88128 ^ by the unbelief

89785 ^ if
89786 ^ for
89787 ^ the things spiritual of them
89790 ^ have shared in
89791 ^ the gentiles,
89793 ^ they ought

91645 ^ and
91646 ^ we toil,

91648 ^ with [our] own hands.
91651 ^ being reviled,
91652 ^ we bless;

94658 ^ we would come under judgment.
94659 ^ being judged
94660 ^ however
94661 ^ by the lord,

95539 ^ i will be
95540 ^ to the [one] speaking
95542 ^ a foreigner,
95543 ^ and
95544 ^ the [one] speaking
95546 ^ to me
95548 ^ a foreigner.
95549 ^ so
95550 ^ also
95551 ^ you,
95552 ^ since

95556 ^ for the edification
95559 ^ of the church,
95561 ^ search
95562 ^ that
95563 ^ you should cause [it] to abound.
95564 ^ therefore
95565 ^ the [one] speaking
95567 ^ in a tongue,
95568 ^ let him pray
95569 ^ that
95570 ^ he might interpret.
95571 ^ if
95572 ^ for
95573 ^ i pray
95574 ^ in a tongue,
95575 ^ the spirit of me
95578 ^ prays,
95579 ^ -
95580 ^ but
95581 ^ the mind of me
95583 ^ unfruitful
95584 ^ is.
95585 ^ what
95586 ^ then
95587 ^ is it?
95588 ^ i will pray
95589 ^ with the spirit,
95591 ^ i will pray
95592 ^ however
95593 ^ also
95594 ^ with the mind.
95596 ^ i will sing praise
95597 ^ with the spirit,
95599 ^ i will sing praise
95600 ^ however
95601 ^ also
95602 ^ with the mind.
95604 ^ otherwise
95605 ^ if
95606 ^ you bless
95607 ^ with the spirit,
95609 ^ the [one] filling
95611 ^ the place
95613 ^ of the uninstructed,
95615 ^ how
95616 ^ will he say
95617 ^ the amen
95619 ^ at - your thanksgiving,
95623 ^ since
95624 ^ what
95625 ^ you say
95626 ^ not
95627 ^ he knows?
95628 ^ you
95629 ^ truly
95630 ^ for
95631 ^ well
95632 ^ are giving thanks,
95633 ^ but
95634 ^ the other
95636 ^ not
95637 ^ is edified.
95638 ^ i thank
95639 ^ - god
95641 ^ than all of you more,
95644 ^ in tongues
95645 ^ speaking;
95646 ^ but
95647 ^ in [the] church,
95649 ^ i desire
95650 ^ five words
95652 ^ with [the] mind of me
95655 ^ to speak
95656 ^ that
95657 ^ also
95658 ^ others
95659 ^ i might instruct,
95660 ^ rather than
95661 ^ ten thousand words
95663 ^ in a tongue.
95665 ^ brothers,
95666 ^ not
95667 ^ children
95668 ^ be
95669 ^ in the minds.
95671 ^ yet
95672 ^ in the evil,
95674 ^ be little children;
95675 ^ in the
95676 ^ however
95677 ^ thinking,
95678 ^ full grown
95679 ^ be.
95680 ^ in the law
95683 ^ it has been written
95684 ^ -:
95685 ^ by other tongues,
95687 ^ and by lips other,
95691 ^ i will speak
95692 ^ to the people this,
95695 ^ and
95696 ^ not even
95697 ^ thus
95698 ^ will they hear
95699 ^ me,
95700 ^ says
95701 ^ [the] lord.”
95702 ^ so then
95703 ^ - tongues
95705 ^ for a sign
95707 ^ are,
95708 ^ not
95709 ^ to those believing,
95711 ^ but
95712 ^ to the unbelieving;
95714 ^ -
95715 ^ but
95716 ^ prophecy
95717 ^ [is] not
95718 ^ to the unbelieving,
95720 ^ but
95721 ^ to the believing.
95723 ^ if
95724 ^ therefore
95725 ^ gathers
95726 ^ the church whole
95729 ^ together the place,
95732 ^ and
95733 ^ all
95734 ^ should speak
95735 ^ in tongues,
95736 ^ come in
95737 ^ however
95738 ^ uninstructed ones
95739 ^ or unbelievers,
95741 ^ not
95742 ^ will they say
95743 ^ that
95744 ^ you are mad?
95745 ^ if
95746 ^ however
95747 ^ all
95748 ^ prophesy,
95749 ^ should come in
95750 ^ then
95751 ^ some unbeliever
95753 ^ or uninstructed,
95755 ^ he is convicted
95756 ^ by all,
95758 ^ he is examined
95759 ^ by all,
95761 ^ the secrets
95763 ^ of the heart of him
95766 ^ manifest
95767 ^ become.
95768 ^ and
95769 ^ thus
95770 ^ having fallen
95771 ^ upon [his] face,
95773 ^ he will worship
95774 ^ - god,
95776 ^ declaring
95777 ^ that
95778 ^ certainly
95779 ^ - god
95781 ^ among you
95783 ^ is.
95784 ^ what
95785 ^ then
95786 ^ is it,
95787 ^ brothers?
95788 ^ when
95789 ^ you may come together,
95790 ^ each
95791 ^ a psalm
95792 ^ has,
95793 ^ a teaching
95794 ^ has,
95795 ^ a revelation
95796 ^ has,
95797 ^ a tongue
95798 ^ has,
95799 ^ an interpretation
95800 ^ has.
95801 ^ all things
95802 ^ for edification
95804 ^ let be done.
95805 ^ if
95806 ^ with a tongue
95807 ^ anyone
95808 ^ speaks,
95809 ^ [let it be] by two
95811 ^ or
95812 ^ the most three,
95815 ^ and in turn;
95818 ^ and
95819 ^ one
95820 ^ let interpret.
95821 ^ if
95822 ^ however

96178 ^ then
96179 ^ also
96180 ^ false witnesses
96181 ^ - of god,

96188 ^ that
96189 ^ he raised up
96190 ^ - christ,
96192 ^ whom
96193 ^ not

96209 ^ then
96210 ^ christ
96211 ^ not
96212 ^ has been raised,
96213 ^ [is] futile
96214 ^ the faith of you
96217 ^ still
96218 ^ you are
96219 ^ in the sins of you.
96223 ^ then
96224 ^ also
96225 ^ those having fallen asleep
96227 ^ in christ
96229 ^ have perished.
96230 ^ if
96231 ^ in the life this,

96240 ^ more to be pitied

96243 ^ we are.
96244 ^ now

96270 ^ so

96285 ^ then
96286 ^ those
96287 ^ of christ
96289 ^ at the coming of him;

96298 ^ the kingdom
96300 ^ to the god
96302 ^ and father,

96342 ^ that
96343 ^ all things

96502 ^ it
96503 ^ a body,
96504 ^ as
96505 ^ he has willed,

96539 ^ but
96540 ^ one
96541 ^ truly
96542 ^ [is] the
96543 ^ of the heavenly glory,
96546 ^ another
96547 ^ now
96548 ^ that
96549 ^ of the earthly.
96551 ^ one [is]

96564 ^ from star
96565 ^ differs
96566 ^ in glory.
96568 ^ so

96570 ^ the resurrection
96572 ^ of the dead.
96574 ^ it is sown

96580 ^ it is sown
96581 ^ in dishonor,

96586 ^ it is sown
96587 ^ in weakness,
96589 ^ it is raised

96622 ^ however
96623 ^ not
96624 ^ first [was]
96625 ^ the spiritual,
96627 ^ but
96628 ^ the natural,
96630 ^ then
96631 ^ the spiritual.
96633 ^ the first man
96636 ^ [was] from [the] earth,

96652 ^ as
96653 ^ the heavenly [one],
96655 ^ so
96656 ^ also
96657 ^ those of heaven.
96659 ^ and
96660 ^ as
96661 ^ we have born
96662 ^ the image

96668 ^ the image
96670 ^ of the heavenly.
96672 ^ this
96673 ^ now
96674 ^ i say,
96675 ^ brothers,
96676 ^ that
96677 ^ flesh
96678 ^ and blood,
96680 ^ [the] kingdom of god
96682 ^ to inherit
96683 ^ not
96684 ^ is able,
96685 ^ nor
96686 ^ the decay,
96688 ^ the immortality
96690 ^ does inherit.
96691 ^ behold,
96692 ^ a mystery
96693 ^ to you
96694 ^ i tell.
96695 ^ all
96696 ^ not
96697 ^ we will sleep;
96698 ^ all
96699 ^ however
96700 ^ we will be changed —
96701 ^ in an instant,
96703 ^ in [the] twinkling of an eye,
96706 ^ at the last trumpet.
96710 ^ the trumpet will sound
96711 ^ for,
96712 ^ and
96713 ^ the dead
96715 ^ will be raised
96716 ^ imperishable,
96717 ^ and
96718 ^ we
96719 ^ will be changed.
96720 ^ it behooves

97704 ^ i have
97705 ^ more abundantly
97706 ^ toward you.
97708 ^ if
97709 ^ however
97710 ^ anyone
97711 ^ has caused grief,
97712 ^ not
97713 ^ me
97714 ^ has he grieved,
97715 ^ but
97716 ^ in part —
97718 ^ that
97719 ^ not
97720 ^ i might put it too severely —
97721 ^ all you.
97723 ^ sufficient
97724 ^ to such a one
97726 ^ [is] the punishment
97728 ^ this,
97729 ^ which [is]
97730 ^ by the majority,
97733 ^ so that
97734 ^ on the contrary

97741 ^ perhaps
97742 ^ - by more abundant sorrow

97755 ^ for this
97757 ^ indeed
97758 ^ also
97759 ^ did i write,
97760 ^ so that
97761 ^ i might know
97762 ^ the proof of you,

97781 ^ anything
97782 ^ i have forgiven,
97783 ^ [it is] for the sake of you
97785 ^ in [the] person of christ,

97879 ^ to one
97880 ^ now,
97881 ^ a fragrance

97894 ^ like the many,
97897 ^ peddling
97898 ^ the word
97900 ^ - of god;
97902 ^ but

97987 ^ to reckon
97988 ^ anything
97989 ^ as of ourselves,

98024 ^ in letters
98026 ^ having been engraved
98027 ^ on stones,
98028 ^ was produced
98029 ^ in glory,

98033 ^ to be able
98034 ^ to look intently
98035 ^ the sons of israel
98038 ^ into the face of moses,
98042 ^ on account of the glory
98045 ^ of the face of him,
98048 ^ which is fading,
98050 ^ how
98051 ^ not
98052 ^ more,
98053 ^ the ministry
98055 ^ of the spirit
98057 ^ will be
98058 ^ in glory?
98060 ^ if
98061 ^ for
98062 ^ in the ministry

98078 ^ has been glorified
98079 ^ that having been made glorious
98081 ^ in this - respect,
98085 ^ on account of the
98087 ^ surpassing [it] glory.
98089 ^ if
98090 ^ for
98091 ^ that which is fading away
98093 ^ [was] through glory,
98095 ^ much more [is]
98097 ^ that remaining
98099 ^ in glory!
98101 ^ having
98102 ^ therefore
98103 ^ such hope,
98105 ^ great boldness
98107 ^ we use,
98108 ^ and
98109 ^ not
98110 ^ as

98112 ^ would put
98113 ^ a veil

98130 ^ but
98131 ^ were hardened
98132 ^ the minds of them.
98135 ^ until
98136 ^ for
98137 ^ the present day,
98140 ^ the same veil
98143 ^ at the reading
98146 ^ of the old covenant
98149 ^ remains,
98150 ^ not
98151 ^ being lifted,
98152 ^ which
98153 ^ in christ
98155 ^ is being removed.
98156 ^ but
98157 ^ unto this day,
98159 ^ when

98163 ^ a veil

98169 ^ whenever

98183 ^ is;
98184 ^ where
98185 ^ now
98186 ^ the spirit of [the] lord [is],
98189 ^ [there is] freedom.
98190 ^ we
98191 ^ now
98192 ^ all,
98193 ^ having been unveiled in face,
98195 ^ the glory of [the] lord
98198 ^ beholding as in a mirror,
98199 ^ the same image
98202 ^ are being transformed into,
98203 ^ from glory
98205 ^ to glory,
98207 ^ even as from [the] lord, [the] spirit.
98211 ^ because of this,
98213 ^ having
98214 ^ the ministry this,
98217 ^ as
98218 ^ we received mercy,
98219 ^ not
98220 ^ we lose heart.
98221 ^ but
98222 ^ we have renounced
98223 ^ the hidden things
98225 ^ - of shame,
98227 ^ not
98228 ^ walking
98229 ^ in craftiness
98231 ^ nor
98232 ^ falsifying
98233 ^ the word
98235 ^ - of god,
98237 ^ but
98238 ^ - by manifestation
98240 ^ of the truth
98242 ^ commending
98243 ^ ourselves
98244 ^ to every conscience of men
98248 ^ before - god.
98251 ^ if
98252 ^ however
98253 ^ indeed
98254 ^ is
98255 ^ concealed
98256 ^ the gospel of us,
98259 ^ to those who are perishing
98262 ^ it is
98263 ^ concealed,
98264 ^ in whom
98266 ^ the god
98268 ^ of the age this
98271 ^ has blinded
98272 ^ the minds
98274 ^ of the unbelieving,
98276 ^ so as for -
98278 ^ not
98279 ^ to beam forth
98280 ^ the illumination
98282 ^ of the gospel
98284 ^ of the glory
98286 ^ - of christ,
98288 ^ who
98289 ^ is
98290 ^ [the] image
98291 ^ - of god.
98293 ^ not
98294 ^ for
98295 ^ ourselves
98296 ^ do we proclaim,
98297 ^ but
98298 ^ jesus
98299 ^ christ lord;
98301 ^ ourselves
98302 ^ now,
98303 ^ servants of you,
98305 ^ for the sake of jesus.
98307 ^ for [it is]
98308 ^ - god,
98310 ^ - having said,
98312 ^ out of darkness
98314 ^ light
98315 ^ shall shine,”
98316 ^ who
98317 ^ shone
98318 ^ in the hearts of us
98322 ^ for [the] radiance
98324 ^ of the knowledge
98326 ^ of the glory
98328 ^ - of god
98330 ^ in [the] face
98332 ^ of jesus christ.
98334 ^ we have
98335 ^ now
98336 ^ the treasure this
98339 ^ in earthen vessels,
98342 ^ that
98343 ^ the surpassingness
98345 ^ of the power
98347 ^ may be
98348 ^ - from god,
98350 ^ and
98351 ^ not
98352 ^ from us,
98354 ^ in every [way]
98356 ^ being hard pressed,
98357 ^ but
98358 ^ not
98359 ^ being crushed;
98360 ^ being perplexed,
98361 ^ but
98362 ^ not
98363 ^ despairing;
98364 ^ being persecuted,
98365 ^ but
98366 ^ not
98367 ^ being forsaken;
98368 ^ being struck down,
98369 ^ but
98370 ^ not
98371 ^ being destroyed;
98372 ^ always
98373 ^ the death
98375 ^ - [of] jesus
98377 ^ in [our] body
98380 ^ carrying around,
98381 ^ so that
98382 ^ also
98383 ^ the life
98385 ^ - of jesus
98387 ^ in the body of us
98391 ^ should be manifested;
98392 ^ always
98393 ^ for
98394 ^ we
98395 ^ the living
98397 ^ to death
98399 ^ are being delivered
98400 ^ on account of jesus,
98402 ^ so that
98403 ^ also
98404 ^ the life
98406 ^ - of jesus
98408 ^ may be manifested
98409 ^ in the mortal flesh of us.
98414 ^ so then,
98415 ^ - death
98417 ^ in us
98419 ^ works,
98420 ^ -
98421 ^ but
98422 ^ life
98423 ^ in you.
98425 ^ having
98426 ^ however
98427 ^ the same spirit
98430 ^ - of faith,
98432 ^ according to that having been written:
98435 ^ i believed,
98436 ^ therefore
98437 ^ i have spoken,”
98438 ^ also
98439 ^ we
98440 ^ believe,
98441 ^ therefore
98442 ^ also
98443 ^ speak,
98444 ^ knowing
98445 ^ that
98446 ^ the [one] having raised up
98448 ^ the lord jesus,
98451 ^ also
98452 ^ us
98453 ^ through jesus
98455 ^ will raise up
98456 ^ and
98457 ^ will present [us]
98458 ^ with you.
98460 ^ -
98461 ^ for
98462 ^ all things [are]
98463 ^ for the sake of you,
98465 ^ so that
98466 ^ the grace
98468 ^ having abounded
98469 ^ through
98470 ^ - more and more the thanksgiving
98474 ^ may increase
98475 ^ to the glory
98478 ^ - of god.
98480 ^ therefore
98481 ^ not
98482 ^ we lose heart;
98483 ^ but
98484 ^ if
98485 ^ indeed
98486 ^ the outward of us man
98490 ^ is being brought to decay,
98491 ^ yet
98492 ^ the inner of us
98495 ^ is being renewed
98496 ^ day
98497 ^ and day.
98499 ^ the
98500 ^ for
98501 ^ momentary lightness
98503 ^ - affliction of us,
98506 ^ far surpassing
98508 ^ to excessiveness
98510 ^ an eternal weight of glory
98513 ^ is producing
98514 ^ for us,
98515 ^ not
98516 ^ are looking at
98517 ^ we
98518 ^ the things being seen,
98520 ^ but
98521 ^ the things
98522 ^ not
98523 ^ being seen.
98524 ^ the things
98525 ^ for
98526 ^ being seen [are]
98527 ^ temporary;
98528 ^ the things
98529 ^ however
98530 ^ not
98531 ^ being seen
98532 ^ [are] eternal.
98533 ^ we know
98534 ^ for
98535 ^ that
98536 ^ if
98537 ^ - earthly
98539 ^ of us house,
98541 ^ the tent,
98543 ^ should be destroyed,
98544 ^ a building
98545 ^ from god
98547 ^ we have,
98548 ^ a house
98549 ^ not made with hands, eternal
98551 ^ in the heavens.
98554 ^ and
98555 ^ indeed,
98556 ^ in this
98558 ^ we groan,
98559 ^ the dwelling of us
98562 ^ which [is]
98563 ^ from heaven
98565 ^ to be clothed with
98566 ^ longing.
98567 ^ if
98568 ^ indeed
98569 ^ also
98570 ^ having been clothed,
98571 ^ not
98572 ^ naked
98573 ^ we will be found.
98574 ^ and
98575 ^ for,
98576 ^ - being
98578 ^ in the tent,
98581 ^ we groan,
98582 ^ being burdened,
98583 ^ because that
98585 ^ not
98586 ^ we do wish
98587 ^ to be unclothed
98588 ^ but
98589 ^ to be clothed,
98590 ^ that
98591 ^ may be swallowed up
98592 ^ the mortal
98594 ^ by - life.
98597 ^ the [one]
98598 ^ now
98599 ^ having prepared
98600 ^ us
98601 ^ for very this
98604 ^ [is] god,
98605 ^ - having given
98607 ^ to us
98608 ^ the pledge
98610 ^ of the spirit,
98612 ^ being confident
98613 ^ therefore
98614 ^ always
98615 ^ and
98616 ^ knowing
98617 ^ that,
98618 ^ being at home
98619 ^ in the body,
98622 ^ we are absent
98623 ^ from the lord;
98626 ^ by faith
98628 ^ for
98629 ^ we walk,
98630 ^ not
98631 ^ by sight.
98633 ^ we are confident
98634 ^ now,
98635 ^ and
98636 ^ are pleased,
98637 ^ rather
98638 ^ to be absent
98639 ^ out of the body,
98642 ^ and
98643 ^ to be at home
98644 ^ with the lord.
98647 ^ therefore
98648 ^ also
98649 ^ we are ambitious,
98650 ^ whether
98651 ^ being at home
98652 ^ or
98653 ^ being away,
98654 ^ well-pleasing
98655 ^ to him
98656 ^ to be.
98657 ^ -
98658 ^ for
98659 ^ all of us
98661 ^ to be revealed
98662 ^ it behooves
98663 ^ before the judgment seat
98666 ^ - of christ,
98668 ^ that
98669 ^ may receive back
98670 ^ each
98671 ^ the things [done]
98672 ^ in the body,
98675 ^ according to what
98677 ^ he did,
98678 ^ whether
98679 ^ good
98680 ^ or
98681 ^ evil.
98682 ^ knowing
98683 ^ therefore
98684 ^ the fear
98686 ^ of the lord,
98688 ^ men
98689 ^ we persuade
98690 ^ to god
98691 ^ and
98692 ^ we have been made manifest;
98693 ^ i hope
98694 ^ now
98695 ^ also
98696 ^ in the consciences of you
98700 ^ to have been made manifest.
98701 ^ not
98702 ^ again
98703 ^ ourselves
98704 ^ are we commending
98705 ^ to you,
98706 ^ but
98707 ^ occasion
98708 ^ are giving
98709 ^ to you
98710 ^ of boasting
98711 ^ on behalf of us,
98713 ^ so that
98714 ^ you may have [an answer]
98715 ^ toward those
98717 ^ in appearance
98719 ^ boasting,
98720 ^ and
98721 ^ not in [the] heart.
98724 ^ if
98725 ^ for
98726 ^ we are beside ourselves,
98727 ^ [it is] to god;
98728 ^ or if
98729 ^ we are sober-minded
98730 ^ [it is] for you.
98731 ^ the
98732 ^ for
98733 ^ love
98734 ^ - of christ
98736 ^ compels
98737 ^ us,
98738 ^ having concluded
98739 ^ this,
98740 ^ that
98741 ^ one
98742 ^ for all
98744 ^ has died,
98745 ^ therefore
98746 ^ - all
98748 ^ have died.
98749 ^ and
98750 ^ for all
98752 ^ he died,
98753 ^ that
98754 ^ those living,
98756 ^ no longer
98757 ^ to themselves
98758 ^ should live,
98759 ^ but
98760 ^ to the [one]
98761 ^ for them
98763 ^ having died
98764 ^ and
98765 ^ having been raised again.
98766 ^ therefore
98767 ^ we
98768 ^ from - now
98771 ^ no one
98772 ^ regard
98773 ^ according to [the] flesh.

98790 ^ [he is] a new creation.
98792 ^ the old things

98812 ^ to us
98813 ^ the ministry
98815 ^ - of reconciliation,
98817 ^ how
98818 ^ that
98819 ^ god
98820 ^ was
98821 ^ in christ
98823 ^ [the] world
98824 ^ reconciling

98848 ^ through us.
98850 ^ we implore
98851 ^ on behalf of christ:

98864 ^ so that
98865 ^ we
98866 ^ might become

99243 ^ also
99244 ^ by the comfort
99247 ^ with which
99248 ^ he was comforted
99249 ^ as to you;
99251 ^ relating
99252 ^ to us
99253 ^ - your earnest desire,
99256 ^ - your mourning,
99259 ^ - your zeal
99262 ^ for me,
99264 ^ so as
99265 ^ for me
99266 ^ the more
99267 ^ to rejoice.
99268 ^ for
99269 ^ if
99270 ^ also
99271 ^ i have grieved
99272 ^ you
99273 ^ in the letter,
99276 ^ not
99277 ^ i do regret [it].
99278 ^ though
99279 ^ even
99280 ^ i did regret [it];
99281 ^ i see
99282 ^ indeed
99283 ^ that
99284 ^ the letter that,
99287 ^ if
99288 ^ even
99289 ^ for an hour,
99291 ^ grieved
99292 ^ you.
99293 ^ now
99294 ^ i rejoice,
99295 ^ not
99296 ^ that
99297 ^ you were grieved,
99298 ^ but
99299 ^ that
99300 ^ you were grieved
99301 ^ unto repentance;
99303 ^ you were grieved
99304 ^ for
99305 ^ according to god,
99307 ^ so that
99308 ^ in nothing
99310 ^ you might suffer loss
99311 ^ through us.
99313 ^ the
99314 ^ for,
99315 ^ according to god grief,
99318 ^ repentance
99319 ^ to salvation
99321 ^ without regret
99322 ^ produces;
99323 ^ -
99324 ^ and
99325 ^ the of the world grief,
99328 ^ death
99329 ^ produces.
99330 ^ behold
99331 ^ for,
99332 ^ this very same
99334 ^ thing,
99335 ^ according to god
99337 ^ to have been grieved,
99338 ^ how much
99339 ^ has produced
99340 ^ in you
99341 ^ earnestness,
99342 ^ but instead reasoned defense,
99344 ^ but indignation,
99346 ^ but fear,
99348 ^ but longing,
99350 ^ but zeal,
99352 ^ but vindication!
99354 ^ in everything,
99356 ^ you have proved
99357 ^ yourselves
99358 ^ innocent
99359 ^ to be
99360 ^ in this matter.
99362 ^ so
99363 ^ if
99364 ^ even
99365 ^ i wrote
99366 ^ to you,
99367 ^ [it was] not
99368 ^ for the sake of the [one] having done wrong,
99371 ^ nor
99372 ^ for the sake of the [one] having suffered wrong,
99375 ^ but rather
99376 ^ for the sake of - being revealed
99379 ^ the earnestness of you,
99382 ^ which [is]
99383 ^ for us
99385 ^ to you
99387 ^ before - god.
99390 ^ on account of this,
99392 ^ we have been comforted.
99393 ^ besides
99394 ^ now
99395 ^ the comfort of us,
99398 ^ the more abundantly
99399 ^ rather
99400 ^ we have rejoiced
99401 ^ at the joy of titus,
99405 ^ because
99406 ^ has been refreshed
99407 ^ the spirit of him
99410 ^ by all of you.
99413 ^ for
99414 ^ if
99415 ^ anything
99416 ^ to him
99417 ^ about you
99419 ^ i have boasted,
99420 ^ not
99421 ^ i was put to shame;
99422 ^ but
99423 ^ as
99424 ^ all things
99425 ^ in truth
99427 ^ we have spoken
99428 ^ to you,
99429 ^ so
99430 ^ also
99431 ^ the boasting of us
99434 ^ -
99435 ^ to titus,
99437 ^ truth
99438 ^ became.
99439 ^ and
99440 ^ the affections of him
99443 ^ more abundantly
99444 ^ toward you
99446 ^ are,
99447 ^ remembering
99448 ^ the
99449 ^ of all of you obedience,
99452 ^ how
99453 ^ with fear
99455 ^ and trembling
99457 ^ you received
99458 ^ him.
99459 ^ i rejoice
99460 ^ that
99461 ^ in everything
99463 ^ i am confident
99464 ^ in you.
99466 ^ we make known
99467 ^ now
99468 ^ to you,
99469 ^ brothers,
99470 ^ the grace
99472 ^ - of god
99474 ^ - having been bestowed
99476 ^ among the churches
99479 ^ - of macedonia,
99481 ^ that
99482 ^ in much proof of tribulation,
99486 ^ the abundance
99488 ^ of the joy of them
99491 ^ and -
99493 ^ of deep poverty of them
99497 ^ abounded
99498 ^ into the riches
99501 ^ the generosity of them.
99504 ^ for
99505 ^ according to [their] ability,
99507 ^ i testify [that],
99508 ^ and beyond [their] ability,
99511 ^ [they were] willing of themselves,
99512 ^ with much entreaty
99515 ^ imploring
99516 ^ of us,
99517 ^ for the grace
99519 ^ and the fellowship
99522 ^ of the service
99524 ^ -
99525 ^ among the saints.
99528 ^ and
99529 ^ not [only]
99530 ^ as
99531 ^ we had hoped,
99532 ^ but
99533 ^ themselves
99534 ^ they gave,
99535 ^ first
99536 ^ to the lord,
99538 ^ and then to us,
99540 ^ by [the] will of god.
99543 ^ accordingly - exhorted
99546 ^ we
99547 ^ titus,
99548 ^ that
99549 ^ as
99550 ^ he had begun,
99551 ^ so
99552 ^ also
99553 ^ he might complete
99554 ^ with you
99556 ^ as well,
99557 ^ the grace this.
99560 ^ but
99561 ^ even as
99562 ^ in every [way]
99564 ^ you abound,
99565 ^ in faith,
99566 ^ and speech,
99568 ^ and knowledge,
99570 ^ and all earnestness,
99573 ^ and in the
99575 ^ from us
99577 ^ to you love,
99580 ^ that
99581 ^ also
99582 ^ in this - grace
99586 ^ you should abound.
99587 ^ not
99588 ^ as a command
99590 ^ do i speak,
99591 ^ but
99592 ^ through the of others earnestness,
99596 ^ also
99597 ^ the
99598 ^ - of your love genuineness
99602 ^ proving.
99603 ^ you know
99604 ^ for
99605 ^ the grace
99607 ^ of the lord of us
99610 ^ jesus christ,
99612 ^ that
99613 ^ for the sake of you
99615 ^ he became poor,
99616 ^ rich
99617 ^ being,
99618 ^ so that
99619 ^ you
99620 ^ - through that poverty
99623 ^ might be enriched.
99624 ^ and
99625 ^ a judgment
99626 ^ in this [matter]
99628 ^ i give,
99629 ^ this
99630 ^ indeed
99631 ^ for you
99632 ^ is profitable,
99633 ^ who
99634 ^ not
99635 ^ only
99636 ^ - to act,
99638 ^ but

101806 ^ you have heard of
101807 ^ for
101808 ^ - my way of life former
101812 ^ in - judaism,
101815 ^ that

101818 ^ i was persecuting

101821 ^ - of god
101823 ^ and
101824 ^ was destroying
101825 ^ it.
101826 ^ and
101827 ^ i was advancing
101828 ^ in - judaism
101831 ^ beyond many contemporaries

101867 ^ in me,
101869 ^ that

101871 ^ him
101872 ^ among the gentiles,
101875 ^ immediately
101876 ^ not
101877 ^ i consulted
101878 ^ with flesh
101879 ^ and blood,
101881 ^ nor
101882 ^ did i go up
101883 ^ to jerusalem
101885 ^ to the
101887 ^ before me apostles,
101890 ^ but
101891 ^ i went away
101892 ^ into arabia,
101894 ^ and
101895 ^ again
101896 ^ returned
101897 ^ to damascus.
101899 ^ then
101900 ^ after years, three
101903 ^ i went up
101904 ^ to jerusalem
101906 ^ to make acquaintance with
101907 ^ cephas,
101908 ^ and
101909 ^ i remained

101912 ^ days fifteen.
101914 ^ other
101915 ^ however
101916 ^ of the apostles
101918 ^ none
101919 ^ i saw,

101921 ^ not
101922 ^ james,
101923 ^ the brother
101925 ^ of the lord.
101927 ^ in what

101932 ^ before - god
101935 ^ -,
101936 ^ not
101937 ^ i lie.
101938 ^ then
101939 ^ i went
101940 ^ into the regions
101943 ^ - of syria
101945 ^ and - cilicia.
101948 ^ i was
101949 ^ then
101950 ^ unknown
101951 ^ - by face
101953 ^ to the churches
101955 ^ - of judea
101957 ^ that [are]
101958 ^ in christ.
101960 ^ only
101961 ^ however
101962 ^ hearing
101963 ^ they were
101964 ^ that
101965 ^ the [one] persecuting
101967 ^ us
101968 ^ formerly,
101969 ^ now
101970 ^ is preaching
101971 ^ the faith
101973 ^ which
101974 ^ once

101976 ^ and
101977 ^ they were glorifying
101978 ^ in me
101980 ^ - god.
101982 ^ then
101983 ^ after fourteen years
101986 ^ again
101987 ^ i went up
101988 ^ to jerusalem
101990 ^ with barnabas,
101992 ^ having taken with [me]
101993 ^ also
101994 ^ titus.
101995 ^ i went up
101996 ^ now
101997 ^ according to a revelation
101999 ^ and
102000 ^ set before
102001 ^ them
102002 ^ the gospel
102004 ^ that
102005 ^ i proclaim
102006 ^ among the gentiles —
102009 ^ apart individually
102011 ^ however
102012 ^ to those esteemed —
102014 ^ lest
102015 ^ hardly
102016 ^ in vain
102018 ^ i should be running

102024 ^ who [was]
102025 ^ with me,
102027 ^ a greek
102028 ^ being,
102029 ^ was compelled
102030 ^ to be circumcised,
102031 ^ because of
102032 ^ even
102033 ^ the brought in secretly false brothers,
102036 ^ who
102037 ^ came in by stealth
102038 ^ to spy out
102039 ^ the freedom of us
102042 ^ which
102043 ^ we have
102044 ^ in christ jesus,
102047 ^ that
102048 ^ us
102049 ^ they will enslave,
102050 ^ to whom
102051 ^ not even
102052 ^ for an hour
102054 ^ did we yield
102055 ^ - in subjection,
102057 ^ so that
102058 ^ the truth
102060 ^ of the gospel
102062 ^ might continue

102066 ^ now
102067 ^ those esteemed
102069 ^ to be
102070 ^ something —
102071 ^ whatsoever
102072 ^ formerly
102073 ^ they were,
102074 ^ not
102075 ^ to me
102076 ^ makes a difference;
102077 ^ [the] person
102078 ^ - god
102080 ^ of a man

102085 ^ the esteemed
102087 ^ nothing

102090 ^ on the contrary,
102091 ^ having seen
102092 ^ that
102093 ^ i have been entrusted with
102094 ^ the gospel
102096 ^ of the uncircumcision,
102098 ^ just as

102100 ^ of the circumcision
102102 ^ the [one]
102103 ^ for
102104 ^ having worked
102105 ^ in peter
102106 ^ for apostleship
102108 ^ of the circumcision
102110 ^ did
102111 ^ also in me
102113 ^ toward the gentiles —
102116 ^ and
102117 ^ having known
102118 ^ the grace
102120 ^ - having been given
102122 ^ to me,
102123 ^ james
102124 ^ and cephas
102126 ^ and john,
102128 ^ those esteemed
102130 ^ pillars
102131 ^ to be,
102132 ^ [the] right hands
102133 ^ gave
102134 ^ to me
102135 ^ and barnabas,
102137 ^ of fellowship,
102138 ^ that
102139 ^ we [should go]
102140 ^ to the gentiles;
102143 ^ they
102144 ^ however
102145 ^ to the circumcision.
102148 ^ only [they asked]
102149 ^ the poor
102151 ^ that
102152 ^ we should remember,
102153 ^ that
102154 ^ also
102155 ^ i was eager
102156 ^ the same thing
102158 ^ to do.
102159 ^ when
102160 ^ however
102161 ^ came
102162 ^ peter
102163 ^ to antioch,
102165 ^ to face
102167 ^ his
102168 ^ i opposed [him],
102169 ^ because
102170 ^ condemned
102171 ^ he stood.
102172 ^ before -
102174 ^ for,
102175 ^ came
102176 ^ certain ones
102177 ^ from james,
102179 ^ with the gentiles
102182 ^ he was eating;
102183 ^ when
102184 ^ however
102185 ^ they came,
102186 ^ he was drawing back
102187 ^ and
102188 ^ was separating
102189 ^ himself,
102190 ^ being afraid of
102191 ^ those
102192 ^ of [the] circumcision.
102194 ^ and
102195 ^ acted hypocritically
102196 ^ with him
102197 ^ also
102198 ^ the rest of [the] jews,
102201 ^ so that
102202 ^ even
102203 ^ barnabas
102204 ^ was carried away
102205 ^ of them by the hypocrisy.
102208 ^ but
102209 ^ when
102210 ^ i saw
102211 ^ that
102212 ^ not
102213 ^ they are walking uprightly
102214 ^ according to the truth
102217 ^ of the gospel,
102219 ^ i said
102220 ^ - to peter
102222 ^ before all,
102224 ^ if
102225 ^ you,
102226 ^ a jew
102227 ^ being,
102228 ^ like a gentile
102229 ^ and not like a jew
102232 ^ live,
102233 ^ why
102234 ^ the gentiles
102236 ^ do you compel
102237 ^ to judaize?
102238 ^ we,
102239 ^ by birth jews,
102241 ^ and not
102243 ^ of [the] gentiles sinners,
102246 ^ knowing
102247 ^ nevertheless
102248 ^ that
102249 ^ not
102250 ^ is justified
102251 ^ a man
102252 ^ by works of law,
102255 ^ if
102256 ^ not
102257 ^ through faith
102259 ^ from jesus; christ
102261 ^ even
102262 ^ we
102263 ^ in christ jesus
102266 ^ have believed,
102267 ^ that
102268 ^ we may be justified
102269 ^ by faith from christ,
102272 ^ and
102273 ^ not
102274 ^ by works of the law;
102277 ^ because
102278 ^ by works of the law

102823 ^ i say
102824 ^ now,
102825 ^ for as long as time
102828 ^ the heir
102830 ^ a child
102831 ^ is,
102832 ^ not
102833 ^ he differs
102834 ^ from a slave,
102835 ^ [though] owner of everything

102838 ^ instead,
102839 ^ under guardians

102842 ^ and trustees,
102844 ^ until the time appointed

102852 ^ when

102854 ^ children,
102855 ^ under the basic principles
102858 ^ of the world
102860 ^ were
102861 ^ held in bondage.
102862 ^ when
102863 ^ however
102864 ^ had come
102865 ^ the fullness
102867 ^ of the time,
102869 ^ sent forth
102870 ^ - god
102872 ^ the son of him,
102875 ^ having been born

102886 ^ so that
102887 ^ the divine adoption as sons
102889 ^ we might receive.
102890 ^ because
102891 ^ now
102892 ^ you are
102893 ^ sons,
102894 ^ sent forth
102895 ^ - god
102897 ^ the spirit

102902 ^ into the hearts of us,
102906 ^ crying out,
102907 ^ abba,
102908 ^ - father!
102910 ^ so
102911 ^ no longer
102912 ^ you are
102913 ^ a slave,
102914 ^ but
102915 ^ a son;
102916 ^ if
102917 ^ now
102918 ^ a son,
102919 ^ also
102920 ^ an heir
102921 ^ through god.
102923 ^ but
102924 ^ at that time
102925 ^ indeed
102926 ^ not
102927 ^ knowing
102928 ^ god,
102929 ^ you were enslaved

102931 ^ by nature
102932 ^ not

102935 ^ now

102939 ^ rather
102940 ^ however
102941 ^ having been known
102942 ^ by god,
102944 ^ how
102945 ^ do you turn
102946 ^ again
102947 ^ to the
102949 ^ weak
102950 ^ and destitute principles,
102953 ^ to which
102954 ^ again anew
102956 ^ to be enslaved
102957 ^ you desire?
102958 ^ days
102959 ^ you observe,
102960 ^ and months
102962 ^ and seasons
102964 ^ and years.
102966 ^ i fear
102967 ^ for you,
102968 ^ lest

102978 ^ i also [have become]
102979 ^ as you,
102981 ^ brothers,
102982 ^ i implore
102983 ^ you.
102984 ^ in nothing
102985 ^ me
102986 ^ have you wronged.
102987 ^ you know
102988 ^ now
102989 ^ that
102990 ^ in weakness
102992 ^ of the flesh
102994 ^ i proclaimed the gospel
102995 ^ to you
102996 ^ at the first;
102998 ^ and
102999 ^ the test of you
103002 ^ in the flesh of me,
103006 ^ not
103007 ^ you did despise [me],
103008 ^ nor
103009 ^ reject [me] with contempt;
103010 ^ but
103011 ^ as an angel of god,
103014 ^ you received
103015 ^ me
103016 ^ even as christ jesus.
103019 ^ what
103020 ^ then
103021 ^ the blessedness of you?
103024 ^ i bear witness
103025 ^ for
103026 ^ to you
103027 ^ that,
103028 ^ if
103029 ^ possible,
103030 ^ the eyes of you
103033 ^ having gouged out,
103034 ^ you would have given [them]

103036 ^ so
103037 ^ enemy of you

103047 ^ to exclude
103048 ^ you [from us].
103049 ^ they desire
103050 ^ so that
103051 ^ them
103052 ^ you might be zealous after.
103053 ^ good [it is]

103055 ^ to be zealous
103056 ^ in a right [thing]

103094 ^ tell
103095 ^ me,
103096 ^ those
103097 ^ under [the] law
103099 ^ wishing
103100 ^ to be,
103101 ^ the law
103103 ^ not
103104 ^ you do listen to?
103105 ^ it has been written
103106 ^ for
103107 ^ that
103108 ^ abraham
103109 ^ two sons

103112 ^ one
103113 ^ of the slave woman

103122 ^ the [one]

103143 ^ two covenants:
103145 ^ one
103146 ^ indeed
103147 ^ from mount sinai,
103150 ^ unto slavery
103152 ^ begetting,
103153 ^ which
103154 ^ is
103155 ^ hagar.
103156 ^ -
103157 ^ and
103158 ^ hagar
103159 ^ sinai mount
103161 ^ is,
103162 ^ in - arabia;
103165 ^ she corresponds
103166 ^ now
103167 ^ to the present jerusalem,
103170 ^ she is in slavery
103171 ^ for
103172 ^ with the children of her.
103176 ^ -
103177 ^ but
103178 ^ the above jerusalem
103180 ^ free
103181 ^ is,
103182 ^ who
103183 ^ is
103184 ^ mother of us.
103186 ^ it has been written
103187 ^ for:

103189 ^ o barren woman,
103190 ^ the [one]
103191 ^ not
103192 ^ bearing;
103193 ^ break forth
103194 ^ and
103195 ^ call aloud,
103196 ^ the [one]
103197 ^ not
103198 ^ travailing;
103199 ^ because
103200 ^ many
103201 ^ [are] the children
103203 ^ of the desolate woman
103205 ^ more,
103206 ^ than
103207 ^ of her having

103211 ^ you
103212 ^ now,
103213 ^ brothers,
103214 ^ like isaac,

103219 ^ but
103220 ^ just as

103222 ^ the [one]

103227 ^ the [one born]
103228 ^ according to spirit,
103230 ^ so
103231 ^ also
103232 ^ [it is] now.
103233 ^ but
103234 ^ what
103235 ^ says
103236 ^ the scripture?
103238 ^ cast out
103239 ^ the slave woman
103241 ^ and the son of her;
103245 ^ no
103246 ^ for

103258 ^ so then,
103259 ^ brothers,
103260 ^ not

103264 ^ but
103265 ^ of the free.
103267 ^ in freedom,
103269 ^ us
103270 ^ christ

103292 ^ i testify
103293 ^ now

103298 ^ that

103305 ^ you are severed
103306 ^ from christ,
103308 ^ whoever
103309 ^ in [the] law
103311 ^ are being justified;
103312 ^ from grace
103314 ^ you have fallen away.

103327 ^ neither
103328 ^ circumcision
103329 ^ any

103340 ^ who
103341 ^ you
103342 ^ cut into,
103343 ^ the truth

103347 ^ [this] persuasion [is]

103354 ^ a little leaven
103356 ^ whole the lump
103359 ^ leavens.
103360 ^ i
103361 ^ am confident

103364 ^ in [the] lord,
103366 ^ that
103367 ^ no other

103370 ^ the [one]

103390 ^ in that case
103391 ^ has been abolished

106645 ^ -
106646 ^ but
106647 ^ to remain
106648 ^ in the flesh

110663 ^ as a thief
110665 ^ by night,
110667 ^ in this manner
110668 ^ comes.
110669 ^ for when
110670 ^ they might say,
110671 ^ peace
110672 ^ and security,
110674 ^ then
110675 ^ suddenly
110676 ^ upon them

110718 ^ so
110719 ^ then
110720 ^ not

116719 ^ a high priest

116760 ^ in things

116764 ^ that
116765 ^ he should offer
116766 ^ gifts both

116774 ^ with those being ignorant

116778 ^ since
116779 ^ also
116780 ^ he himself

116784 ^ because of this
116786 ^ he is obligated,

116788 ^ for the people,
116791 ^ so
116792 ^ also
116793 ^ for himself,

116867 ^ with crying loud
116870 ^ and tears

116875 ^ because of - reverence,
116878 ^ though
116879 ^ being
116880 ^ a son,
116881 ^ he learned
116882 ^ from the things
116884 ^ he suffered,
116885 ^ - obedience,
116887 ^ and
116888 ^ having been perfected,
116889 ^ he became
116890 ^ to all those obeying

116906 ^ concerning this
116908 ^ [there is] much

116917 ^ you have become
116918 ^ in the hearings.
116920 ^ even
116921 ^ for
116922 ^ you ought

117536 ^ a priest another,

117565 ^ there is
117566 ^ of the preceding commandment,

117577 ^ the law —
117579 ^ [the] introduction
117580 ^ then
117581 ^ of a better hope,
117583 ^ by which
117585 ^ we draw near

117624 ^ of a better covenant

117630 ^ those
117631 ^ indeed
117632 ^ many
117633 ^ are
117634 ^ having become
117635 ^ priests,
117636 ^ because of -

117639 ^ being prevented from
117640 ^ continuing.

117674 ^ such
117675 ^ indeed
117676 ^ for us
117677 ^ also
117678 ^ was fitting
117679 ^ a high priest,
117680 ^ holy, innocent, undefiled,
117683 ^ having been separated
117684 ^ from - sinners,
117687 ^ and
117688 ^ higher

117741 ^ now
117742 ^ of the things being spoken of [is that]
117745 ^ such
117746 ^ we have,
117747 ^ a high priest
117748 ^ who
117749 ^ sat down

117784 ^ wherefore [it was]
117785 ^ necessary
117786 ^ to have
117787 ^ something
117788 ^ also
117789 ^ [for] this one
117790 ^ that
117791 ^ he might offer.

117799 ^ -
117800 ^ would he be
117801 ^ a priest,

117820 ^ to complete
117821 ^ the tabernacle.

117834 ^ in the mountain.”
117837 ^ now,
117838 ^ however,
117839 ^ more excellent
117840 ^ he has obtained
117841 ^ a ministry,
117842 ^ as much as
117843 ^ also
117844 ^ of a better

131559 ^ out of the pit,
