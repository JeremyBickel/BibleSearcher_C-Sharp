5612 ^ he departed from there
5614 ^ - to teach
5616 ^ and to preach in the cities of them.
5622 ^ - and

5715 ^ those - delicate [clothing]

5725 ^ but
5726 ^ what did you go out, to see?
5729 ^ a prophet
5730 ^ yes, i say to you,
5733 ^ and [one] more excellent than a prophet.
5736 ^ for this is [he]
5738 ^ concerning whom it has been written:
5741 ^ behold,
5742 ^ i send the messenger of me before [the] face of you,
5750 ^ who will prepare the way of you before you.’
5757 ^ truly i say to you,
5760 ^ not there has risen among [those] born of women one greater than john the baptist.
5769 ^ - yet
5771 ^ the least in the kingdom of the heavens, greater than he is.
5780 ^ from then
5782 ^ the days of john the baptist until now, the kingdom of the heavens is taken by violence,
5794 ^ and [the] violent claim it.
5798 ^ all for
5800 ^ the prophets and the law until john prophesied.
5808 ^ and if you are willing
5811 ^ to receive [it],
5812 ^ he is elijah,
5815 ^ the one being about
5817 ^ to come.
5818 ^ the [one] having ears, let him hear!
5822 ^ to what however will i compare the generation this?
5828 ^ like it is
5830 ^ little children
5831 ^ sitting in the markets,
5835 ^ and
5836 ^ calling out - to others, saying:
5840 ^ we piped for you,
5842 ^ and not you did dance;
5845 ^ we sang a dirge
5846 ^ and not you did wail.
5849 ^ came for john
5852 ^ neither eating
5854 ^ nor drinking,
5856 ^ and they say,
5858 ^ a demon he has!
5860 ^ came the son - of man
5865 ^ eating
5866 ^ and drinking,
5868 ^ and they say,
5870 ^ behold,
5871 ^ a man, a glutton and a drunkard, of tax collectors a friend
5877 ^ and of sinners!
5879 ^ but is justified - wisdom by the deeds of her.
5887 ^ then he began
5889 ^ to denounce the cities
5892 ^ in which had taken place the most miracles of him,
5899 ^ because not they repented.
5902 ^ woe to you, chorazin!
5905 ^ woe to you, bethsaida!
5908 ^ for if in tyre and sidon had taken place the miracles
5917 ^ - having come to pass in you,
5921 ^ long ago then in sackcloth and ashes they would have repented.
5928 ^ but i say to you,
5931 ^ for tyre and sidon more tolerable will it be in [the] day of judgment
5939 ^ than for you.
5941 ^ and you, capernaum, not to heaven will be exalted,
5948 ^ to hades will be brought down!
5951 ^ for if in sodom had taken place the miracles
5958 ^ - having taken place in you,
5962 ^ it would have remained - until the day.
5967 ^ but i say to you,
5970 ^ that for [the] land of sodom more tolerable will it be in day of judgment
5978 ^ than for you.
5980 ^ at that - time
5984 ^ answering, - jesus said,
5988 ^ i fully consent to you, father, lord of the heaven and the earth,
5997 ^ that you did hide these things from wise and learned,
6004 ^ and did reveal them to little children.
6008 ^ yes, - father,
6011 ^ for thus well-pleasing it was before you.
6017 ^ all things to me have been delivered by the father of me.
6024 ^ and no one knows the son,
6029 ^ if not the father;
6033 ^ nor the father anyone does know,
6038 ^ if not the son,
6042 ^ and
6043 ^ to whom if might choose the son
6048 ^ to reveal [him].
6049 ^ come to me, all
6053 ^ those toiling
6055 ^ and being burdened,
6057 ^ and i will give rest to you.
6060 ^ take the yoke of me upon you
6066 ^ and learn from me,
6070 ^ for gentle i am
6073 ^ and humble [in] the heart,
6077 ^ and you will find rest [for] the souls of you.
6083 ^ the for
6085 ^ yoke of me [is] easy,
6088 ^ and the burden of me light is.
6094 ^ at that - time went - jesus on the sabbaths through the grainfields,
6106 ^ - and
6108 ^ the disciples of him were hungry,
6111 ^ and they began
6113 ^ to pluck [the] heads of grain
6115 ^ and to eat.
6117 ^ - and
6119 ^ the pharisees,
6120 ^ having seen, said to him,
6123 ^ behold,
6124 ^ the disciples of you are doing
6128 ^ what not it is lawful to do on sabbath.
6134 ^ - and he said to them,
6138 ^ not you have read
6140 ^ what did david
6143 ^ when he was hungry,
6145 ^ and those with him —
6149 ^ how he entered into the house - of god,
6156 ^ and the loaves of the presentation they ate,
6563 ^ the [one] not
6565 ^ being with me against me is,
6571 ^ and
6572 ^ the [one] not
6574 ^ gathering with me scatters.
6578 ^ because of this i say to you,
6582 ^ every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven - men;
6589 ^ - however
6591 ^ against [the] spirit blasphemy not will be forgiven.
6596 ^ and whoever if speaks a word against the son - of man,
6606 ^ it will be forgiven him;
6608 ^ whoever now - speaks against - spirit the holy,
6617 ^ not it will be forgiven him, neither in this - age
6625 ^ nor in the coming [one].
6629 ^ either make the tree good
6634 ^ and the fruit of it good,
6639 ^ or make the tree bad
6644 ^ and the fruit of it bad;
6649 ^ by for
6651 ^ the fruit, the tree is known.
6656 ^ offspring of vipers, how are you able
6660 ^ good things to speak,
6662 ^ evil being?
6664 ^ out of for
6666 ^ the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
6673 ^ the good man out of his good treasure puts forth good things;
6682 ^ and the evil man out of his evil treasure puts forth evil things.
6692 ^ i say now to you
6695 ^ that every word careless
6699 ^ that will speak - men,
6703 ^ they will give of it an account in day of judgment.
6710 ^ by for
6712 ^ the words of you, you will be justified,
6716 ^ and by the words of you, you will be condemned.
6722 ^ then answered him some of the scribes and pharisees,
6730 ^ saying,
6731 ^ teacher, we wish
6733 ^ from you a sign to see.
6737 ^ - and
6739 ^ answering he said to them,
6742 ^ a generation evil and adulterous a sign seeks for,
6748 ^ and a sign not will be given to it,
6753 ^ if not the sign of jonah the prophet.
6760 ^ just as for was jonah in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights,
6774 ^ so will be the son - of man in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
6790 ^ the men of nineveh will stand up in the judgment with the generation this,
6800 ^ and will condemn it;
6803 ^ for they repented at the preaching of jonah;
6809 ^ and behold,
6811 ^ greater than jonah here.
6814 ^ the queen of [the] south will rise up in the judgment with the generation this,
6824 ^ and will condemn it;
6827 ^ for she came from the ends of the earth
6834 ^ to hear the wisdom of solomon,
6838 ^ and behold,
6840 ^ greater than solomon here.
6843 ^ when now the unclean spirit is gone out from the man,
6852 ^ it passes through waterless places
6856 ^ seeking rest,
6858 ^ and none finds [it].
6861 ^ then it says,
6863 ^ to the house of me i will return,
6868 ^ from where i came out.
6870 ^ and
6871 ^ having come, it finds [it]
6873 ^ being unoccupied,
6874 ^ swept,
6875 ^ and put in order.
6877 ^ then it goes
6879 ^ and takes with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself,
6888 ^ and
6889 ^ having entered in they dwell there;
6892 ^ and becomes the last of the man that worse than the first.
6902 ^ so it will be also unto generation this the evil.
6910 ^ while he was speaking to the crowds,
6915 ^ behold,
6916 ^ the mother and the brothers of him were standing outside,
6924 ^ seeking
6925 ^ to him to speak.
6927 ^ said now someone to him,
6931 ^ behold,
6932 ^ the mother of you and the brothers of you outside are standing,
6941 ^ seeking
6942 ^ to you to speak.
6944 ^ - and
6946 ^ answering, he said
6948 ^ to the [one] telling him,
6951 ^ who is the mother of me,
6956 ^ and who are the brothers of me?
6962 ^ and
6963 ^ having stretched out the hand of him to the disciples of him, he said,
6972 ^ behold,
6973 ^ the mother of me and the brothers of me.
6980 ^ whoever for - shall do the will the father of me who [is] in [the] heavens,
6992 ^ he my brother and sister and mother is.
7000 ^ in the day that,
7004 ^ having gone forth - jesus [from] the house, was sitting by the sea.
7013 ^ and were gathered together to him crowds great,
7019 ^ so that he into a boat
7023 ^ having entered sat down,
7025 ^ and all the crowd on the shore stood.
7033 ^ and he spoke to them many things in parables,
7039 ^ saying,
7040 ^ behold,
7041 ^ went out
7042 ^ the [one] sowing
7044 ^ - to sow.
7046 ^ and
7047 ^ in - sowing of him, some indeed fell along the road,
7057 ^ and
7058 ^ having come, the birds devoured them.
7063 ^ other now fell upon the rocky places,
7069 ^ where not it had soil much,
7074 ^ and immediately it sprang up,
7077 ^ through - not
7080 ^ having depth of soil;
7127 ^ the [one] having ears, let him hear!
7131 ^ and
7132 ^ having come to [him], the disciples said to him,
7137 ^ because of why in parables speak you to them?
7143 ^ - and
7145 ^ answering, he said to them,
7148 ^ because to you it has been granted
7151 ^ to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens;
7158 ^ to them however not it has been granted.
7162 ^ whoever for has,
7165 ^ will be given to him,
7167 ^ and he will be in abundance;
7169 ^ whoever now not has,
7173 ^ even
7174 ^ what he has will be taken away from him.
7179 ^ because of this, in parables to them i speak:
7185 ^ because
7186 ^ seeing, not do they see;
7189 ^ and
7190 ^ hearing, not do they hear,
7193 ^ nor do they understand.
7195 ^ and is fulfilled in them the prophecy of isaiah,
7201 ^ - saying:
7203 ^ in hearing you will hear,
7205 ^ and no not understand;
7209 ^ and
7210 ^ seeing you will see
7212 ^ and no not perceive.
7216 ^ has grown dull for the heart of the people this,
7223 ^ and with the ears barely they have heard,
7228 ^ and the eyes of them they have closed;
7233 ^ not lest they should see with the eyes,
7237 ^ and with the ears they should hear,
7241 ^ and with the heart they should understand,
7245 ^ and should return,
7247 ^ and i will heal them.’
7250 ^ of you however blessed
7253 ^ [are] the eyes,
7255 ^ because they see;
7257 ^ and the ears of you,
7261 ^ because they hear.
7263 ^ truly for i say to you,
7267 ^ that many prophets and righteous [men] longed
7273 ^ to see
7274 ^ what you see,
7276 ^ and not saw;
7279 ^ and
7280 ^ to hear
7281 ^ what you hear,
7283 ^ and not heard.
7286 ^ you therefore hear the parable
7291 ^ of the [one] having sown:
7293 ^ everyone hearing the word of the kingdom
7299 ^ and not understanding,
7302 ^ comes the evil one
7305 ^ and snatches away
7307 ^ that having been sown in the heart of him.
7313 ^ this is
7315 ^ the [one] on the path
7319 ^ having been sown.
7320 ^ that which now upon the rocky places
7325 ^ having been sown,
7326 ^ this is
7328 ^ the [one] the word
7331 ^ hearing,
7332 ^ and immediately with joy receiving it;
7338 ^ no he has now root in himself,
7344 ^ but temporary is;
7347 ^ having come however tribulation or persecution on account of the word,
7355 ^ immediately he falls away.
7357 ^ that which now among the thorns
7362 ^ having been sown,
7363 ^ this is
7365 ^ the [one] the word
7368 ^ hearing,
7369 ^ and the care - [the] present age and the deceit - of riches choke the word,
7382 ^ and unfruitful it becomes.
7385 ^ that however on the good soil
7391 ^ having been sown,
7392 ^ this is
7394 ^ the [one] the word
7397 ^ hearing
7398 ^ and understanding,
7400 ^ who indeed brings forth fruit
7403 ^ and produces —
7405 ^ some indeed a hundredfold,
7408 ^ some now sixty,
7411 ^ some now thirty.
7414 ^ another parable put he before them,
7418 ^ saying,
7419 ^ has become like the kingdom of the heavens, a man
7425 ^ having sown good seed in the field of him.
7685 ^ the [one] sowing the good seed is the son - of man;
7695 ^ - and
7697 ^ the field is the world;
7701 ^ - and
7703 ^ the good seed,
7705 ^ these are the sons of the kingdom;
7711 ^ - and
7713 ^ the weeds are the sons of the evil [one];
7719 ^ - and
7721 ^ the enemy
7722 ^ - having sown them is the devil;
7728 ^ - and
7730 ^ the harvest [the] consummation of the age is,
7734 ^ - and
7736 ^ the harvesters angels are.
7739 ^ as therefore is gathered the weeds,
7744 ^ and in fire is consumed,
7747 ^ thus it will be in the consummation of the age.
7754 ^ will send forth the son - of man the angels of him,
7762 ^ and they will gather out of the kingdom of him all the causes of sin
7771 ^ and those practicing - lawlessness,
7776 ^ and they will cast them into the furnace of the fire;
7784 ^ there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
7793 ^ then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of the father of them.
7806 ^ the [one] having ears, let him hear!
7810 ^ like is the kingdom of the heavens
7816 ^ treasure
7817 ^ having been hidden in the field,
8394 ^ those then
8396 ^ eating were men about five thousand, besides women and children.
8405 ^ and immediately he compelled
8408 ^ the disciples to enter into the boat
8414 ^ and to go before him to the other side,
8420 ^ until that he would have dismissed the crowds.
8425 ^ and
8426 ^ having dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself
8435 ^ to pray.
8436 ^ evening now having arrived,
8439 ^ alone he was there.
8442 ^ - and
8444 ^ the boat, now stadia many from the land, being
8452 ^ tossed by the waves
8456 ^ was, for contrary [was] the wind.
8461 ^ in [the] fourth now
8463 ^ watch of the night, he went to them,
8469 ^ walking on the sea.
8473 ^ - and
8475 ^ the disciples,
8476 ^ having seen him
8478 ^ on the sea walking, were troubled,
8483 ^ saying
8484 ^ -, a ghost it is!
8487 ^ and in - fear they cried out.
8492 ^ immediately now spoke - jesus to them,
8498 ^ saying,
8499 ^ take courage!
8500 ^ i it is,
8502 ^ not fear.
8873 ^ the things however going forth out of the mouth, out of the heart come forth,
8883 ^ and these defile the man.
8887 ^ out of for
8889 ^ the heart come forth thoughts evil, murders, adulteries, sexual immorality, thefts, false testimonies, slanders.
8900 ^ these are
8902 ^ the things defiling the man;
8906 ^ - but with unwashed hands
8910 ^ to eat, not defiles the man.
8915 ^ and
8916 ^ having gone forth from there, - jesus withdrew to the district of tyre and sidon.
8927 ^ and behold,
8929 ^ a woman canaanite from the region same,
8935 ^ having approached, was crying out,
8937 ^ saying,
8938 ^ have mercy on me, lord, son of david;
8943 ^ the daughter of me miserably is possessed by a demon.
8948 ^ - and not he answered her a word.
8954 ^ and
8955 ^ having come to [him], the disciples of him were imploring him,
8961 ^ saying,
8962 ^ dismiss her,
8964 ^ for she cries out after us!
8968 ^ - and
8970 ^ answering he said,
8972 ^ not i was sent,
8974 ^ if not to the sheep
8979 ^ - being lost of [the] house of israel.
8983 ^ - and
8985 ^ having come, she was worshiping him,
8988 ^ saying,
8989 ^ lord, help me!
8992 ^ - and
8994 ^ answering, he said,
8996 ^ not it is right
8999 ^ to take the bread of the children,
9004 ^ and to cast [it] to the dogs.
9008 ^ - and she said,
9011 ^ yes, lord;
9013 ^ even however the dogs eat of the crumbs
9021 ^ - falling from the table of the masters of them.
9029 ^ then
9030 ^ answering, - jesus said to her,
9035 ^ o woman, great [is] of you the faith!
9041 ^ be it to you
9043 ^ as you desire.
9045 ^ and was healed the daughter of her from the hour that.
9054 ^ and
9055 ^ having departed from there, - jesus went along the sea - of galilee;
9065 ^ and
9066 ^ having gone up on the mountain, he was sitting there.
9072 ^ and came to him crowds great,
9077 ^ having with them lame, blind, crippled, mute, and others many,
9087 ^ and they placed them at the feet of him,
9094 ^ and he healed them;
9097 ^ so that the crowd marveled,
9101 ^ seeing mute
9103 ^ speaking, crippled restored, and lame
9108 ^ walking, and blind
9111 ^ seeing;
9112 ^ and they glorified the god of israel.
9117 ^ - and
9119 ^ jesus,
9120 ^ having called to [him] the disciples of him, said,
9125 ^ i am moved with compassion toward the crowd,
9129 ^ because already days three they continue with me,
9135 ^ and nothing have
9138 ^ that they might eat;
9140 ^ and
9141 ^ to send away them hungry, not i am willing,
9146 ^ not lest they faint on the way.
9151 ^ and say to him the disciples,
9156 ^ from where to us in a secluded place, loaves so many
9162 ^ as to satisfy a crowd so great.
9166 ^ and says to them - jesus,
9171 ^ how many loaves have you?
9174 ^ - and they said,
9177 ^ seven, and a few small fish.
9181 ^ and
9182 ^ he having commanded the crowds
9185 ^ to sit down on the ground, having taken the seven loaves and the fish,
9196 ^ and
9197 ^ having given thanks, he broke [them]
9199 ^ and was giving to disciples,
9203 ^ - and the
9205 ^ disciples to the crowd.
9208 ^ and ate all
9211 ^ and were satisfied;
9213 ^ and
9214 ^ that being over and above of the fragments, they took up
9219 ^ seven baskets full.
9222 ^ those then
9224 ^ eating were four thousand men, besides women and children.
9232 ^ and
9233 ^ having dismissed the crowds, he entered into the boat
9240 ^ and came to the region of magadan.
9246 ^ and
9247 ^ having approached, the pharisees and sadducees,
9252 ^ testing , asked him
9255 ^ a sign out of - heaven to show them.
9261 ^ - and
9263 ^ answering he said to them,
9266 ^ evening having come,
9268 ^ you say,
9269 ^ fair weather;
9270 ^ is red for the sky.
9274 ^ and in the morning,
9276 ^ today a storm;
9278 ^ is red for
9280 ^ being overcast the sky.
9678 ^ whoever for if might desire
9682 ^ the life of him to save, will lose it;
9688 ^ whoever however - might lose the life of him on account of me, will find it.
9699 ^ what for will it profit a man,
9703 ^ if the world whole he gains,
9708 ^ - but
9710 ^ the soul of him loses?
9713 ^ or what will give a man [as] an exchange for the soul of him?
9721 ^ is about for the son of the man
9727 ^ to come in the glory the father of him, with the angels of him;
9738 ^ and then he will give to each according to the deeds of him.
9746 ^ truly i say to you
9749 ^ -, there are some
9752 ^ of those here
9754 ^ standing
9755 ^ who no not shall taste of death
9760 ^ until - they have seen the son - of man
9767 ^ coming in the kingdom of him.
9772 ^ and after days six, takes with [him] - jesus, - peter and james and john, the brother of him,
9788 ^ and brings up them into a mountain high by themselves.
9796 ^ and he was transfigured before them,
9800 ^ and shone the face of him like the sun,
9808 ^ - and
9810 ^ the clothes of him became white as the light.
9817 ^ and behold,
9819 ^ appeared to them moses and elijah,
9824 ^ talking with him.
10625 ^ how many if you shall bind on the earth, shall have been
10632 ^ bound in heaven;
10635 ^ and
10636 ^ how many if you shall loose on the earth, shall have been
10643 ^ loosed in heaven.
10646 ^ again truly i say to you
10650 ^ that if two might agree
10654 ^ of you on the earth concerning any matter,
10662 ^ that if they shall ask,
10665 ^ it will be done for them by the father of me who [is] in [the] heavens.
10674 ^ where for are two or three
10680 ^ gathered together unto - my name,
10685 ^ there am i in [the] midst of them.
10690 ^ then
10691 ^ having come, - peter said to him,
10696 ^ lord, how often will sin against me the brother of me,
10704 ^ and i will forgive him?
10707 ^ up to seven times?
10709 ^ says to him - jesus,
10713 ^ not i say to you
10716 ^ up to seven times,
10718 ^ but up to seventy times seven!
10722 ^ because of this, has become like the kingdom of the heavens to a man, a king,
10731 ^ who desired
10733 ^ to settle accounts with the servants of him.
10739 ^ having begun then he
10742 ^ to settle,
10743 ^ was brought to him, one a debtor of ten thousand talents.
10749 ^ nothing having now he
10753 ^ to pay,
10754 ^ commanded
10755 ^ him the master
10758 ^ to be sold, and the wife and the children, and all
10767 ^ as many as he had,
10769 ^ and payment to be made.
11147 ^ the [one] being able
11149 ^ to receive [it], let him receive [it].
11151 ^ then were brought to him little children,
11155 ^ that the hands he might lay on them,
11160 ^ and he might pray.
11162 ^ - however
11164 ^ the disciples rebuked them.
11167 ^ - and
11169 ^ jesus said,
11171 ^ permit the little children,
11174 ^ and not do forbid them
11178 ^ to come to me;
11181 ^ of the for
11183 ^ such kind is the kingdom of the heavens.
11189 ^ and
11190 ^ having laid the hands upon them, he departed from there.
11196 ^ and behold,
11198 ^ one
11199 ^ having come to him, said,
11202 ^ teacher, what good [thing] shall i do,
11206 ^ that i might have life eternal?
11210 ^ - and he said to him,
11214 ^ why me ask you about what is good?
11220 ^ only one is
11222 ^ - good.
11224 ^ if however you desire
11227 ^ into - life to enter,
11231 ^ keep the commandments.
11234 ^ he says to him,
11236 ^ which?
11237 ^ - and
11239 ^ jesus said,
11836 ^ - but to sit on [the] right hand of me and on [the] left, not is
11847 ^ mine this to give,
11850 ^ but [to those]
11851 ^ for whom it has been prepared by the father of me.
11857 ^ and
11858 ^ having heard [this], the ten were indignant about the two brothers.
11866 ^ - and
11868 ^ jesus,
11869 ^ having called to [him] them, said,
11872 ^ you know
11873 ^ that the rulers of the gentiles exercise lordship over them,
11880 ^ and the great ones exercise authority over them.
11885 ^ not thus will it be among you;
11890 ^ but
11891 ^ whoever if wishes
11894 ^ among you great to become, he will be your servant;
11901 ^ and
11902 ^ whoever - wishes
11905 ^ among you to be first, he will be your slave;
11912 ^ even as the son - of man not came to be served,
11920 ^ but
11921 ^ to serve,
11922 ^ and to give the life of him [as] a ransom for many.
11930 ^ and [as] were going out they from jericho,
11935 ^ followed him a crowd great.
11939 ^ and behold,
11941 ^ two blind [men]
11943 ^ sitting beside the road,
11947 ^ having heard
11948 ^ that jesus is passing by, cried out,
11952 ^ saying,
11953 ^ have mercy on us, lord, son of david.
11958 ^ - and
11960 ^ the crowd rebuked them,
11963 ^ that they should be silent.
11965 ^ - but all the more they cried out,
11969 ^ saying,
11970 ^ have mercy on us, lord, son of david.
11975 ^ and
11976 ^ having stopped, - jesus called them
11981 ^ and said,
12993 ^ those however having been invited not were worthy.
12999 ^ go therefore into the thoroughfares of the highways,
13006 ^ and
13007 ^ as many as if you shall find, invite to the wedding feast.
13014 ^ and
13015 ^ having gone out the servants those into the highways, they brought together all
13024 ^ as many as they found, evil both and good;
13030 ^ and became full the wedding hall
13034 ^ of those reclining.
13693 ^ he who then shall exalt himself will be humbled,
13698 ^ and
13699 ^ whoever shall humble himself will be exalted.
13703 ^ woe however to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites!
13710 ^ for you shut up the kingdom of the heavens before - men;
13719 ^ you for neither enter,
13723 ^ nor even
13724 ^ those who are entering do you allow
13727 ^ to go in.
13728 ^ woe to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites!
13734 ^ for you traverse the sea and the dry [land]
13741 ^ to make one convert,
13744 ^ and when he has become [so],
13747 ^ you make him a son of hell twofold more than yourselves.
13753 ^ woe to you, guides blind,
13757 ^ those saying,
13759 ^ whoever - shall swear by the temple, nothing it is;
13767 ^ whoever however - shall swear by the gold of the temple
13776 ^ is bound by his oath.
13777 ^ foolish and blind! which for greater is,
13784 ^ the gold,
13786 ^ or the temple
13789 ^ - having sanctified the gold?
13793 ^ and [you say],
13794 ^ whoever - shall swear by the altar, nothing it is;
13802 ^ whoever however - shall swear by the gift that [is] upon it,
13812 ^ he is bound by his oath.
13813 ^ you blind men! which for [is] greater,
13817 ^ the gift,
13819 ^ or the altar
13822 ^ - sanctifying the gift?
13826 ^ the [one] therefore having sworn by the altar swears by it and by all things that [are] upon it.
13841 ^ and
13842 ^ the [one] having sworn by the temple swears by it
13850 ^ and by the [one] dwelling in it.
13855 ^ and
13856 ^ the [one] having sworn by - heaven swears by the throne - of god
13867 ^ and by the [one] sitting upon it.
13873 ^ woe to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites!
13879 ^ for you pay tithes of - mint, and - dill, and - cumin;
13889 ^ and you have neglected the weightier [matters] of the law: - justice and - mercy and - faithfulness.
13903 ^ these now it behooved you
13906 ^ to do,
13907 ^ those not to be leaving aside.
13910 ^ guides blind!
13912 ^ those straining out the gnat,
13916 ^ the however
13918 ^ camel swallowing!
13920 ^ woe to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites!
13926 ^ for you cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish;
13935 ^ inside, however, they are full of greed and self-indulgence.
13942 ^ pharisee blind! cleanse first the inside of the cup
13950 ^ that might become also the outside of them clean.
13957 ^ woe to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites!
13963 ^ for you are like tombs
13966 ^ having been whitewashed,
13967 ^ which outwardly indeed appear beautiful.
13972 ^ inside however they are full of bones of [the] dead, and of all impurity.
13980 ^ thus also, you outwardly indeed appear - to men righteous,
13989 ^ inwardly however you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
13996 ^ woe to you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites!
14002 ^ for you build the tombs of the prophets
14008 ^ and adorn the monuments of the righteous;
14014 ^ and you say,
14016 ^ if we had lived in the days of the fathers of us,
14024 ^ not - we would have been with them partakers in the blood of the prophets.
14034 ^ thus you bear witness to yourselves
14037 ^ that sons you are
14374 ^ the [one] however having endured to [the] end,
14379 ^ he will be saved.
14381 ^ and there will be proclaimed this - gospel of the kingdom in all the earth, for a testimony to all the nations;
14397 ^ and then will come the end.
14402 ^ when therefore you shall see the abomination - of desolation,’
14409 ^ - having been spoken of by daniel the prophet,
14415 ^ standing in [the] place holy —
14419 ^ the [one] reading let him understand —
14422 ^ then those in - judea, let them flee to the mountains;
14431 ^ the [one] on the housetop, not let him come down
14437 ^ to take anything out of the house of him;
14443 ^ and the [one] in the field, neither let him return back
14451 ^ to take the cloak of him.
14455 ^ woe then
14457 ^ to those in womb
14460 ^ having,
14461 ^ and to the [ones] nursing infants in those the days.
14468 ^ pray however
14470 ^ that not might be the flight of you in winter,
14477 ^ nor on a sabbath.
14479 ^ there will be for then tribulation great,
14484 ^ such as not has been from [the] beginning of [the] world until - now,
14493 ^ no never not shall be.
14497 ^ and if not had been shortened the days those,
14504 ^ not - there would have been saved any flesh;
14509 ^ because of however
14511 ^ the elect, will be shortened the days those.
14517 ^ then if anyone to you says,
14522 ^ behold,
14523 ^ here [is] the christ,
14526 ^ or here,
14528 ^ not believe [it].
14530 ^ there will arise for false christs and false prophets,
14535 ^ and they will give signs great, and wonders,
14541 ^ so as to mislead,
14543 ^ if possible, even the elect.
14548 ^ behold,
14549 ^ i have foretold [it] to you.
14551 ^ if therefore they say to you,
14555 ^ behold,
14556 ^ in the wilderness he is,
14560 ^ not go forth;
14562 ^ [or] ‘behold,
14563 ^ in the inner rooms,
14566 ^ not believe [it].
14568 ^ just as for the lightning comes forth from [the] east
14575 ^ and shines as far as [the] west,
14579 ^ so will be the coming of the son - of man.
14587 ^ for wherever if may be the carcass,
14592 ^ there will be gathered the vultures.
14596 ^ immediately then after the tribulation the days of those: the sun will be darkened,
14607 ^ and the moon not will give the light of it,
14615 ^ and the stars will fall from the sky,
14622 ^ and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.’
14628 ^ and then will appear the sign of the son - of man in heaven,
14639 ^ and then will mourn all the tribes of the earth,
14647 ^ and they will see the son - of man
14653 ^ coming on the clouds - of heaven with power and glory great.
14664 ^ and he will send the angels of him with a trumpet call great,
14672 ^ and they will gather together the elect of him, from the four winds, from [the] ends of the heavens to the ends of them.
14688 ^ of now
14690 ^ the fig tree learn the parable:
14695 ^ when already the branch of it may have become tender
14702 ^ and the leaves it puts forth,
14706 ^ you know
14707 ^ that near [is] the summer.
14711 ^ thus also you,
14714 ^ when you see all these things, know
14719 ^ that near he is, at [the] doors.
14724 ^ truly i say to you
14727 ^ that no not will have passed away the generation this
14734 ^ until - all these things shall have taken place.
14739 ^ the heaven and the earth will pass away,
14745 ^ - but
14747 ^ the words of me no not shall pass away.
14752 ^ concerning however
14754 ^ the day that and hour, no one knows,
14761 ^ not even the angels of the heavens,
14766 ^ nor the son,
14769 ^ if not the father only.
14774 ^ as [were] for the days - of noah,
14780 ^ so will be the coming of the son - of man.
14788 ^ as for they were in the days those - before the flood,
14799 ^ eating
14800 ^ and drinking,
14802 ^ marrying
14803 ^ and giving in marriage,
14805 ^ until that day entered noah into the ark.
14813 ^ and not they knew,
14816 ^ until came the flood
14820 ^ and took away all;
14823 ^ thus will be also the coming of the son - of man.
14832 ^ then two will be in the field:
14838 ^ one is taken,
14840 ^ and one is left.
14843 ^ two [women]
14844 ^ will be grinding at the mill:
14848 ^ one is taken,
14850 ^ and one is left.
14853 ^ keep watch therefore,
14855 ^ for not you know
14858 ^ on what day the lord of you comes.
14864 ^ this then know,
14867 ^ that if had known the master of the house
14872 ^ in what time of night the thief comes,
14877 ^ he would have watched -
14879 ^ and not - have allowed
14883 ^ to be broken into the house of him.
14887 ^ because of this also, you be ready,
14893 ^ for
14894 ^ in that not you expect
14897 ^ hour, the son - of man comes.
14903 ^ who then is the faithful servant, and wise,
14911 ^ whom has set the master over the household of him,
14919 ^ - to give to them the food in season?
14926 ^ blessed [is] the servant that,
14930 ^ whom
14931 ^ having come, the master of him will find
14936 ^ thus doing.
14938 ^ truly i say to you
14941 ^ that
14942 ^ over all the possessing of him he will set him.
14949 ^ if however should say the evil servant that in the heart of him,
14960 ^ delays of me the master,
14964 ^ and should begin
14966 ^ to beat the fellow servants of him,
14970 ^ to eat then
14972 ^ and to drink
14974 ^ with those being drunkards,
14977 ^ will come the master the servant of that in a day
14985 ^ in which not he does expect, and in an hour
14991 ^ which not he is aware,
14994 ^ and will cut in pieces him,
14997 ^ and the place of him with the hypocrites will appoint;
15005 ^ there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
15014 ^ then will be likened the kingdom of the heavens to ten virgins,
15022 ^ who
15023 ^ having taken the lamps of them, went forth to meet the bridegroom.
15032 ^ five now
15034 ^ of them were foolish,
15038 ^ and five wise.
15041 ^ the for
15043 ^ foolish,
15044 ^ having taken the lamps of them, not did take with them oil;
15053 ^ - but
15055 ^ the wise took oil in the vessels, with the lamps of them.
15065 ^ tarrying then the bridegroom,
15069 ^ they became drowsy all
15071 ^ and were sleeping.
15073 ^ at middle then
15075 ^ of [the] night, a cry there was:
15078 ^ behold,
15079 ^ the bridegroom!
15081 ^ go forth to meet him!
15085 ^ then arose all the virgins those
15091 ^ and trimmed the lamps of them.
15096 ^ - and
15098 ^ the foolish to the wise said,
15102 ^ give us of the oil of you,
15108 ^ for the lamps of us are going out.
15113 ^ answered then the wise,
15117 ^ saying,
15118 ^ lest no not even it might suffice for us and you.
15125 ^ go rather
15127 ^ to those selling,
15130 ^ and buy for yourselves.
15133 ^ [while] are going away then they
15136 ^ to buy,
15137 ^ came the bridegroom,
15140 ^ and those ready went in with him to the wedding feast;
15149 ^ and was shut the door.
15153 ^ afterward then come also the other virgins,
15160 ^ saying,
15161 ^ lord, lord, open to us!
15165 ^ - and
15167 ^ answering he said,
15169 ^ truly i say to you,
15172 ^ not i do know you.
15175 ^ watch therefore,
15177 ^ for neither do you know the day,
15182 ^ nor the hour.
15185 ^ [it is] like for a man
15188 ^ going on a journey [who] called the own servants,
15193 ^ and delivered to them
15196 ^ the possessing of him.
15199 ^ and to one indeed he gave five talents,
15205 ^ to one then two,
15208 ^ to one then one,
15211 ^ to each according to the own ability;
15216 ^ and he left the region
15218 ^ immediately.
15219 ^ having gone,
15220 ^ the [one] the five talents
15224 ^ having received traded with them
15228 ^ and made more five.
15232 ^ likewise, the [one with] the two gained more two.
15239 ^ the [one] however - one having received,
15244 ^ having gone away, dug in the ground
15247 ^ and hid the money of the master of him.
15254 ^ after then
15256 ^ much time, comes the master of the servants those
15264 ^ and takes account with them.
15269 ^ and
15270 ^ having come,
15271 ^ the [one] the five talents
15275 ^ having received brought to [him] other five talents,
15280 ^ saying,
15281 ^ master, five talents to me you did deliver.
15286 ^ behold,
15287 ^ more five talents have i gained.
15291 ^ said to him the master of him,
15296 ^ well done, servant good and faithful!
15301 ^ over a few things you were faithful;
15305 ^ over many things you will i set.
15309 ^ enter into the joy of the master of you!
15458 ^ the [one] however not having,
15462 ^ even
15463 ^ that which he has will be taken away from him.
15468 ^ and the worthless servant, cast out into the darkness - outer;
15478 ^ there will be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.
15487 ^ when then comes the son - of man in the glory of him,
15498 ^ and all the angels with him,
15504 ^ then he will sit upon [the] throne of glory of him.
15510 ^ and will be gathered before him all the nations,
15517 ^ and he will separate them from one another,
15522 ^ as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
15531 ^ and he will set - indeed
15535 ^ the sheep on [the] right hand of him,
15539 ^ - and
15541 ^ the goats on [the] left.
15544 ^ then will say the king to those on [the] right hand of him,
15552 ^ come,
15553 ^ those being blessed of the father of me,
15558 ^ inherit the having been prepared for you kingdom from [the] foundation of [the] world.
15566 ^ i hungered for,
15568 ^ and you gave me
15571 ^ to eat;
15572 ^ i thirsted,
15573 ^ and you gave to drink me;
15576 ^ a stranger i was,
15578 ^ and you took in me;
15581 ^ naked,
15582 ^ and you clothed me;
15585 ^ i was sick,
15586 ^ and you visited me;
15589 ^ in prison i was,
15592 ^ and you came to me.
15596 ^ then will answer him the righteous,
15601 ^ saying,
15602 ^ lord, when you saw we
16078 ^ the [one] having dipped with me the hand in the dish,
16087 ^ he me will betray.
16090 ^ - indeed
16092 ^ the son - of man goes
16096 ^ as it has been written about him;
16100 ^ woe however - the man to that
16105 ^ by whom the son - of man is betrayed.
16112 ^ better would it be for him
16115 ^ if not had been born the man that.
16531 ^ the [one] then betraying him gave them a sign,
16538 ^ saying,
16539 ^ whomever - i shall kiss,
16542 ^ he it is;
16544 ^ seize him.
16546 ^ and immediately
16548 ^ having come up - to jesus, he said,
16552 ^ greetings, rabbi,
16554 ^ and kissed him.
16557 ^ - and
16559 ^ jesus said to him,
16562 ^ friend, for what are you come?”
16566 ^ then
16567 ^ having come to [him], they laid - hands on - jesus
16574 ^ and seized him.
16577 ^ and behold,
16579 ^ one of those with jesus,
16583 ^ having stretched out the hand, drew the sword of him,
16590 ^ and
16591 ^ having struck the servant of the high priest, cut off of him the ear.
16600 ^ then says to him - jesus,
16605 ^ return the sword of you into the place of it;
16613 ^ all for those having taken [the] sword, by [the] sword will perish.
16621 ^ or think you
16623 ^ that not i am able
16626 ^ to call upon the father of me,
16630 ^ and he will furnish to me presently more than twelve legions of angels?
16638 ^ how then should be fulfilled the scriptures,
16643 ^ that
16644 ^ so it must be?
16647 ^ in that - hour, said - jesus to the crowds,
16656 ^ as against a robber
16659 ^ did you come out with swords and clubs
16664 ^ to capture me?
16666 ^ every day in the temple i was sitting
16672 ^ teaching,
16673 ^ and not you did seize me.
16677 ^ this then
16679 ^ all is come to pass,
16681 ^ that might be fulfilled the scriptures of the prophets.
16687 ^ then the disciples all,
16691 ^ having forsaken him, fled.
16694 ^ those then
16696 ^ having seized - jesus led [him] away to caiaphas, the high priest,
16704 ^ where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
16711 ^ - and
16713 ^ peter was following him from afar, even to the court of the high priest.
16723 ^ and
16724 ^ having entered within, he was sitting with the guards
16730 ^ to see the outcome.
16733 ^ - and
16735 ^ the chief priests and the council whole were seeking false testimony against - jesus,
16745 ^ so that him they might put to death;
16748 ^ but not any they found,
16751 ^ of many having come forward as
16753 ^ false witnesses.
16754 ^ at last then,
16756 ^ having come forward two, they said,
16759 ^ this [man] has been saying,
16761 ^ i am able
16762 ^ to destroy the temple - of god,
16767 ^ and in three days to rebuild it.
16772 ^ and
16773 ^ having stood up, the high priest said to him,
16778 ^ nothing answer you?
16780 ^ what these you do witness against?
16784 ^ - and
16786 ^ jesus was silent.
16788 ^ and the high priest said to him,
16793 ^ i adjure you by - god
16798 ^ the living,
16800 ^ that us you tell
16803 ^ if you are the christ, the son - of god.
16812 ^ says to him - jesus,
16816 ^ you have said.
16818 ^ but i say to you,
16821 ^ from now you will see the son - of man
16828 ^ sitting at [the] right hand - of power
16833 ^ and coming upon the clouds - of heaven.”
16840 ^ then the high priest tears the garments of him,
16847 ^ saying,
16848 ^ he has blasphemed;
16849 ^ why any more need have we
16853 ^ of witnesses?
16854 ^ behold
16855 ^ now, you have heard the blasphemy.
16859 ^ what you do think?
16862 ^ - and
16864 ^ answering they said,
16866 ^ deserving of death he is.
16869 ^ then they spat in the face of him,
16875 ^ and struck him.
16878 ^ others then slapped [him],
16881 ^ saying,
16882 ^ prophesy to us, christ,
16885 ^ who is
16887 ^ the [one] having struck you?
16890 ^ - and
16892 ^ peter was sitting outside in the court,
16898 ^ and came to him one servant girl,
16903 ^ saying,
16904 ^ also you were with jesus the galilean.
16911 ^ - and he denied before all,
16916 ^ saying,
16917 ^ not i know
16919 ^ what you say.
17569 ^ those now passing by kept railing at him,
17574 ^ wagging the heads of them
17578 ^ and saying,
17580 ^ the [one] destroying the temple
17584 ^ and in three days building [it],
17589 ^ save yourself!
17591 ^ if [the] son you are
17594 ^ - of god,
17596 ^ also descend from the cross!
17601 ^ likewise also the chief priests,
17605 ^ mocking, with the scribes and elders, were saying,
17612 ^ others he saved.
20026 ^ whoever however - shall blaspheme against the spirit - holy not has forgiveness to the age,
20041 ^ but guilty is
20044 ^ [of] eternal sin.
20046 ^ for they were saying,
20048 ^ a spirit unclean he has.
20051 ^ and arrive the mother of him and the brothers of him,
20060 ^ and
20061 ^ outside standing, sent to him,
20066 ^ calling him.
20068 ^ and was sitting around him a crowd.
20073 ^ and they said to him,
20076 ^ behold,
20077 ^ the mother of you and the brothers of you and the sisters of you outside are seeking you.
20091 ^ and
20092 ^ he answering them, says,
20095 ^ who are the mother of me and the brothers of me?
20104 ^ and
20105 ^ having looked around on
20106 ^ those who around him in a circle
20110 ^ were sitting, he says,
20112 ^ behold,
20113 ^ the mother of me, and the brothers of me!
20120 ^ whoever for - shall do the will - of god,
20128 ^ he brother of me, and sister, and mother is.
20136 ^ and again, he began
20139 ^ to teach beside the sea.
20143 ^ and was gathered together to him a crowd great,
20149 ^ so that he
20151 ^ into a boat having entered, sat in the sea,
20158 ^ and all the crowd close to the sea on the land was.
20169 ^ and he began teaching them in parables many things,
20175 ^ and he was saying to them in the teaching of him,
20182 ^ listen!
20183 ^ behold,
20184 ^ went out
20185 ^ the [one] sowing
20187 ^ to sow.
20188 ^ and it came to pass
20190 ^ as - he sowed,
20193 ^ some - fell along the road,
20199 ^ and came the birds
20203 ^ and devoured it.
20206 ^ and other fell upon the rocky place,
20212 ^ where not it had soil much,
20217 ^ and immediately it sprang up,
20220 ^ because of the not having depth of soil.
20226 ^ and after rose the sun,
20231 ^ it was scorched,
20232 ^ and
20233 ^ because of - not having root, it withered away.
20239 ^ and other fell among the thorns,
20245 ^ and grew up the thorns,
20249 ^ and choked it,
20252 ^ and fruit no it yielded.
20256 ^ and other fell into the soil - good,
20264 ^ and began yielding fruit,
20267 ^ growing up
20268 ^ and increasing,
20270 ^ and bearing one thirtyfold,
20274 ^ and one sixty,
20277 ^ and one a hundred.
20280 ^ and he was saying,
20282 ^ he who has ears
20285 ^ to hear, let him hear.
20287 ^ and when he was with alone,
20292 ^ began asking him those around him with the twelve about the parable.
20302 ^ and he was saying to them,
20305 ^ to you the mystery has been given
20309 ^ of the kingdom - of god.
20313 ^ to those however
20315 ^ who are outside, in parables - everything is done,
20322 ^ so that,
20323 ^ seeing, they might see
20325 ^ and not perceive;
20328 ^ and
20329 ^ hearing, they might hear
20331 ^ and not understand;
20334 ^ lest ever they should turn,
20336 ^ and should be forgiven them.’
20339 ^ and he says to them,
20342 ^ not understand you the parable this?
20347 ^ and how all the parables will you understand?
20353 ^ the [one] sowing, the word sows.
20358 ^ these now are they along the road,
20365 ^ where is sown the word,
20369 ^ and when they hear,
20372 ^ immediately comes - satan
20376 ^ and takes away the word
20380 ^ - having been sown in them.
20384 ^ and these are
20387 ^ those upon the rocky places
20391 ^ sown,
20392 ^ who,
20393 ^ when they hear the word, immediately with joy receive it,
20402 ^ and not they have root in themselves,
20408 ^ but temporary are;
20411 ^ then having arisen tribulation or persecution on account of the word,
20419 ^ immediately they fall away.
20421 ^ and these are
20424 ^ those among the thorns
20428 ^ sown.
20429 ^ these are
20431 ^ those, the word
20434 ^ having heard,
20435 ^ and the cares - of this age, and the deceit of the riches, and - of the other things desires
20451 ^ entering in, choke the word,
20455 ^ and unfruitful it becomes.
20458 ^ and these are
20461 ^ those upon the soil - good
20467 ^ having been sown;
20468 ^ such as hear the word
20472 ^ and receive [it],
20474 ^ and bring forth fruit,
20476 ^ one thirtyfold,
20478 ^ and one sixty,
20481 ^ and one a hundred.
20484 ^ and he was saying to them
20487 ^ not is brought in the lamp
20491 ^ so that under the basket it might be put,
20496 ^ or under the bed?
20500 ^ [is it] not that upon the lampstand it might be put?
20506 ^ nothing for there is hidden,
20510 ^ if not that it should be made manifest,
20514 ^ nor has taken place a secret thing,
20517 ^ but that it should come to light.
20522 ^ if anyone has ears
20526 ^ to hear,
20527 ^ let him hear.
20528 ^ and he was saying to them,
20531 ^ take heed
20532 ^ what you hear.
20534 ^ with what measure you measure
20538 ^ it will be measured to you,
20540 ^ and more will be added to you.
20543 ^ whoever for may have,
20546 ^ it will be given to him;
20548 ^ and he who not has,
20552 ^ even that which he has will be taken away from him.
20558 ^ and he was saying,
20560 ^ thus is the kingdom - of god,
20566 ^ as a man should cast the seed upon the earth,
20574 ^ and should sleep
20576 ^ and rise night and day,
20581 ^ and the seed should sprout
20585 ^ and grow;
20587 ^ how not knows he.
20591 ^ of itself, the earth brings forth fruit — first a plant, then an ear, then full grain in the ear.
20605 ^ when then offers itself the fruit,
20610 ^ immediately he sends the sickle,
20614 ^ for has come the harvest.
20618 ^ and he was saying,
20620 ^ to what shall we liken the kingdom - of god?
20626 ^ or in what it
20630 ^ parable shall we present?
20632 ^ as to a grain of mustard,
20635 ^ which,
20636 ^ when it has been sown upon the earth, smallest is
20643 ^ of all the seeds which [are] upon the earth,
20650 ^ and when it has been sown,
20653 ^ it grows up
20654 ^ and becomes greater than all the garden plants,
20660 ^ and it produces branches great,
20664 ^ so that are able
20666 ^ under the shadow of it the birds of the air to perch.
20675 ^ and with such parables many, he kept speaking to them the word,
20683 ^ as they were able
20685 ^ to hear.
20686 ^ without then
20688 ^ parables, not would he speak to them;
20692 ^ in private however, to his own disciples he would explain all things.
20700 ^ and he says to them on that - day,
20707 ^ evening having come,
20709 ^ let us pass over to the other side.
20713 ^ and
20714 ^ having dismissed the crowd, they take with [them] him
20719 ^ since he was in the boat;
20724 ^ also other boats were with him.
20730 ^ and comes a storm violent of wind,
20735 ^ and the waves were breaking over the boat,
20742 ^ so that already is being filled up the boat.
20747 ^ and he was in the stern,
20753 ^ on the cushion sleeping.
20757 ^ and they awaken him
20760 ^ and say to him,
20763 ^ teacher, not is it concern to you
20767 ^ that we perish?
20769 ^ and
20770 ^ having been awoken he rebuked the wind
20774 ^ and said to the sea,
20778 ^ silence,
20779 ^ be still.
20780 ^ and abated the wind,
20784 ^ and there was a calm great.
20788 ^ and he said to them,
20791 ^ why fearful are you?
20794 ^ still not have you faith?
20797 ^ and they feared [with] fear great,
20801 ^ and were saying to each other,
20805 ^ who then this is,
20809 ^ that even the wind and the sea obey him?
20818 ^ and they came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the gerasenes.
20830 ^ and having gone forth of him out of the boat,
20836 ^ immediately met him out of the tombs a man with a spirit unclean,
20846 ^ who the dwelling had in the tombs.
20853 ^ and not even with chains no longer anyone was able
20859 ^ him to bind,
20861 ^ because that he often with shackles and chains
20868 ^ had been bound,
20869 ^ and had been torn in two by him the chains,
20875 ^ and the shackles had been shattered,
20879 ^ and no one was able
20882 ^ him to subdue.
20884 ^ and constantly all night and day in the tombs and in the mountains he was
20898 ^ crying out
20899 ^ and cutting himself with stones.
20903 ^ and
20904 ^ having seen - jesus from afar, he ran
20910 ^ and fell on his knees before him.
20913 ^ and
20914 ^ having cried in a voice loud, he said,
20918 ^ what to me and to you, jesus, son - of god the most high?
20928 ^ i adjure you - by god,
20932 ^ not me torment.
20935 ^ he was saying for to him,
20938 ^ you come forth, the spirit - unclean, out of the man!
20946 ^ and he was asking him,
20949 ^ what [is] [the] name of you?
20952 ^ and saying, he answered,
20955 ^ legion [is] name to me,
20958 ^ because many we are.
20961 ^ and he begged him numerous times
20965 ^ that not them he would send out of the country.
20972 ^ there was now there, near the mountain, a herd of pigs great
20981 ^ feeding.
20982 ^ and they begged him,
20985 ^ saying,
20986 ^ send us into the pigs,
20991 ^ so that into them we may enter.
20995 ^ and he allowed them.
20998 ^ and
20999 ^ having gone out, the spirits - unclean entered into the pigs,
21008 ^ and rushed the herd down the steep bank into the sea, about two thousand,
21020 ^ and they were drowned in the sea.
21025 ^ and
21026 ^ those feeding them fled
21030 ^ and proclaimed [it] to the city and to the country.
21039 ^ and they went out
21041 ^ to see
21042 ^ what it is
21044 ^ that has been done.
21046 ^ and they come to - jesus
21051 ^ and see
21053 ^ the [man] possessed by demons
21055 ^ sitting,
21056 ^ clothed
21057 ^ and sound minded, the [one]
21060 ^ having had the legion;
21063 ^ and they were afraid.
21065 ^ and related to them
21068 ^ those having seen [it]
21070 ^ how it happened
21072 ^ to the [one] being possessed by demons, and concerning the pigs.
21078 ^ and they began
21080 ^ to implore
21081 ^ him to depart from the region of them.
21087 ^ and having entered he into the boat,
21093 ^ was begging him
21095 ^ the [one] having been possessed by demons,
21097 ^ that with him he might be.
21101 ^ and not he did permit him,
21105 ^ but he says to him,
21108 ^ go to the home of you, to - your own,
21116 ^ and report to them
21119 ^ how much the lord for you did
21124 ^ and had mercy on you.
21127 ^ and he departed
21129 ^ and began
21131 ^ to proclaim in the decapolis
21135 ^ how much had done for him - jesus;
21140 ^ and all were marveling.
21143 ^ and having passed over - jesus in the boat again to the other side,
21154 ^ was gathered a crowd great to him,
21159 ^ and he was beside the sea.
21164 ^ and comes one of the synagogue rulers, named jairus,
21171 ^ and
21172 ^ having seen him, falls at the feet of him
21179 ^ and he begs him much,
21183 ^ saying
21184 ^ -, the little daughter of me at the end is holding,
21190 ^ that,
21191 ^ having come, you would lay the hands on her,
21196 ^ so that she might be cured,
21198 ^ and she shall live.
21200 ^ and he departed with him.
21204 ^ and was following him a crowd great,
21209 ^ and pressing in on him.
21212 ^ and a woman,
21214 ^ being with a flux of blood twelve years,
21220 ^ and much having suffered under many physicians,
21226 ^ and having spent the of her all,
21232 ^ and in no way having benefited,
21235 ^ but rather to the worse having come,
21241 ^ having heard concerning - jesus,
21245 ^ having come up in the crowd behind, she touched the clothing of him.
21254 ^ she was saying for
21256 ^ -, if i shall touch even the garments of him,
21263 ^ i will be healed.
21264 ^ and immediately was dried up the flow of the blood of her,
21272 ^ and she knew in the body
21276 ^ that she was healed from the affliction.
21281 ^ and immediately - jesus,
21285 ^ having known in himself the out of him power having gone forth,
21293 ^ having turned in the crowd, said,
21298 ^ who of me touched
21301 ^ the garments?
21303 ^ and were saying to him the disciples of him,
21309 ^ you see the crowd
21312 ^ pressing in on you,
21314 ^ and say you,
21316 ^ who me touched?
21319 ^ and he was looking around
21321 ^ to see
21322 ^ the [one] this
21324 ^ having done.
21325 ^ - and
21327 ^ the woman,
21328 ^ having been frightened
21329 ^ and trembling,
21331 ^ knowing
21332 ^ what had been done to her, came
21336 ^ and fell down before him
21339 ^ and told him all the truth.
21345 ^ - and he said to her,
21349 ^ daughter, the faith of you has healed you;
21355 ^ go in peace
21358 ^ and be sound from the affliction of you.
21365 ^ [while] yet he is speaking,
21368 ^ they come from the ruler of synagogue’s [house],
21372 ^ saying
21373 ^ -, the daughter of you is dead;
21378 ^ why still trouble you the teacher?
21383 ^ - and
21385 ^ jesus,
21386 ^ having heard the word
21389 ^ spoken, says to the ruler of the synagogue,
21393 ^ not fear;
21395 ^ only believe.
21397 ^ and not he allowed no one
21401 ^ with him to follow,
21404 ^ if not - peter and james and john the brother of james.
21415 ^ and they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue,
21422 ^ and he beholds a commotion,
21425 ^ and weeping
21427 ^ and wailing much.
21430 ^ and
21431 ^ having entered, he says to them,
21434 ^ why make you commotion
21436 ^ and weep?
21438 ^ the child not is dead,
21442 ^ but sleeps.
21444 ^ and they were laughing at him.
21447 ^ he then,
21449 ^ having put out all, takes with [him] the father of the child, and the mother, and those with him,
21463 ^ and enters in
21465 ^ where was the child.
21469 ^ and
21470 ^ having taken the hand of the child, he says to her,
21477 ^ talitha, koum!
21479 ^ which is,
21481 ^ translated,
21482 ^ - little girl, to you i say,
21486 ^ arise!
21487 ^ and immediately arose the girl
21492 ^ and began walking;
21494 ^ she was for of years twelve.
21498 ^ and they were overcome immediately with amazement great.
21503 ^ and he instructed them strictly
21507 ^ that no one should know this;
21511 ^ and he commanded
21513 ^ to be given to her
21515 ^ to eat.
21516 ^ and he went out from there
21519 ^ and came into the hometown of him;
21525 ^ and follow him the disciples of him.
21531 ^ and having come [the] sabbath,
21534 ^ he began
21535 ^ to teach in the synagogue;
21539 ^ and many
21541 ^ hearing were astonished,
21543 ^ saying,
21544 ^ from where to this [man] these things,
21547 ^ and what [is] the wisdom
21551 ^ - having been given to him,
21554 ^ even the miracles, such
21558 ^ by the hands of him are done?
21563 ^ not this is the carpenter, the son - of mary, and brother of james and joseph and judas and simon?
21581 ^ and not are the sisters of him here with us?
21590 ^ and they took offense at him.
21594 ^ and said to them - jesus
21599 ^ -, not is a prophet without honor,
21604 ^ if not in the hometown of him, and among - relatives of him, and in the household of him.
21620 ^ and not he was able
21623 ^ there to do not any work of power,
21627 ^ if not
21629 ^ on a few sick, having laid the hands, he healed.
21635 ^ and he was amazed because of the unbelief of them.
21641 ^ and he was going the villages around,
21646 ^ teaching.
21647 ^ and he calls near the twelve,
21651 ^ and he began
21653 ^ them to send forth two [by] two,
21657 ^ and he gave to them authority over the spirits - unclean.
21665 ^ and he instructed them
21668 ^ that nothing they should take for [the] journey,
21673 ^ if not a staff only;
21677 ^ no bread,
21679 ^ nor bag,
21681 ^ nor in the belt money;
21686 ^ but
21687 ^ wearing sandals,
21689 ^ and not put on two tunics.
21694 ^ and he would say to them,
21697 ^ wherever if you enter into a house,
21702 ^ there remain
21704 ^ until - you go out from there.
21708 ^ and whatever - place not will receive you
21715 ^ nor hear you,
23650 ^ whoever for if might desire
23654 ^ - life his to save, will lose it;
23660 ^ whoever now - will lose the life of him on account of me and of the gospel, he will save it.
23674 ^ what for does it profit
23677 ^ a man to gain the world whole
23682 ^ and to lose the soul of him?
23687 ^ what for shall give a man [as] an exchange for the soul of him?
23695 ^ whoever for if may be ashamed of me and - my words in the generation this - adulterous and sinful,
23712 ^ also the son - of man will be ashamed of him
23719 ^ when he shall come in the glory of the father of him, with the angels - holy.
23732 ^ and he was saying to them,
23735 ^ truly i say to you
23738 ^ that there are some
23741 ^ here of those standing,
23744 ^ who no not shall taste of death,
23749 ^ until - they see the kingdom - of god
23756 ^ having come with power.
23759 ^ and after days six takes along - jesus, - peter and - james and - john,
23774 ^ and brings up them into a mountain high apart themselves alone.
23783 ^ and he was transfigured before them,
23787 ^ and the garments of him became
23792 ^ shining white exceedingly,
23795 ^ such as a launderer on the earth not is able
23802 ^ thus to whiten.
23804 ^ and appeared to them elijah with moses,
23810 ^ and they were
23812 ^ talking with - jesus.
23815 ^ and
23816 ^ answering, - peter says - to jesus,
23822 ^ rabbi, good it is
23825 ^ for us here to be.
23828 ^ and let us make three tabernacles: for you one, and for moses one, and for elijah one.
23840 ^ not for he knew
23843 ^ what he should say;
23845 ^ terrified for they were.
23848 ^ and there came a cloud
23851 ^ overshadowing them,
23853 ^ and there came a voice out of the cloud:
23859 ^ this is the son of me, the beloved;
23866 ^ listen you to him.
23868 ^ and suddenly,
23870 ^ having looked around, no longer no one they saw
23874 ^ except - jesus alone with them.
23880 ^ and descending of them from the mountain,
23886 ^ he instructed them
23888 ^ that to no one
23890 ^ what they had seen they should tell,
23893 ^ if not until the son - of man out from [the] dead had risen.
23903 ^ and that saying they kept among themselves,
23909 ^ questioning
23910 ^ what it is
23912 ^ - out from the dead
23915 ^ to rise.
23916 ^ and they were asking him,
23919 ^ saying
23920 ^ -, say the scribes
23924 ^ that
23925 ^ elijah it behooves to come first?
23929 ^ - and he was saying to them,
23933 ^ elijah indeed
23935 ^ having come first, restores all things;
23939 ^ and how has it been written of the son - of man,
23947 ^ that many things he should suffer
23950 ^ and be set at naught?
23952 ^ but i say to you,
23955 ^ that also elijah has come,
23959 ^ and they did to him
23962 ^ whatever they desired,
23964 ^ as it has been written of him.
23968 ^ and
23969 ^ having come to the disciples, they saw a crowd great around them, and scribes
23980 ^ arguing with them.
23983 ^ and immediately all the crowd,
23988 ^ having seen him, were greatly amazed,
23991 ^ and
23992 ^ running to [him], were greeting him.
23995 ^ and he asked them,
23998 ^ what are you disputing with them?
24002 ^ and answered him one out of the crowd,
24009 ^ teacher, i brought the son of me to you,
24016 ^ having a spirit mute;
24019 ^ and whenever if him it seizes,
24024 ^ it throws down him;
24026 ^ and he foams,
24028 ^ and gnashes - his teeth,
24032 ^ and is withering away.
24034 ^ and i spoke to the disciples of you,
24039 ^ that it they might cast out,
24042 ^ and not they had power.
24045 ^ - and
24047 ^ answering him, he says,
24050 ^ o generation unbelieving! until when with you will i be?
24058 ^ until when will i bear with you?
24062 ^ bring him to me.
24066 ^ and they brought him to him.
24071 ^ and
24072 ^ having seen him, the spirit immediately threw into convulsions him,
24079 ^ and
24080 ^ having fallen upon the ground, he began rolling around,
24085 ^ foaming.
24086 ^ and he asked the father of him,
24091 ^ how long a time is it
24094 ^ that this has been with him?
24098 ^ - and he said,
24101 ^ from childhood.
24103 ^ and often both into fire him it casts,
24110 ^ and into waters,
24113 ^ that it might destroy him.
24116 ^ but if anything you are able [to do],
24120 ^ help us,
24122 ^ having compassion on us.
24125 ^ - and
24127 ^ jesus said to him,
24130 ^ -
24131 ^ if you are able?
24133 ^ all things are possible
24135 ^ to the [one] believing.
24137 ^ immediately
24138 ^ having cried out, the father of the child was saying,
24144 ^ i believe;
24145 ^ help of me the unbelief!
24149 ^ having seen now - jesus
24153 ^ that was running together a crowd, he rebuked the spirit - unclean,
24161 ^ saying to it,
24163 ^ - mute and deaf spirit, i command you,
24171 ^ come out of him,
24174 ^ and no more may you enter into him.
24179 ^ and
24180 ^ having cried out,
24181 ^ and much having thrown him into convulsions, it came out;
24185 ^ and he became as if dead,
24189 ^ in order for - many to say
24193 ^ that he was dead.
24195 ^ - and
24197 ^ jesus,
24198 ^ having taken by the hand him, raised up him,
24204 ^ and he arose.
24206 ^ and having entered he into a house,
24211 ^ the disciples of him in private were asking him,
24218 ^ why we not were able
24222 ^ to cast out it?
24224 ^ and he said to them,
24227 ^ this - kind by nothing is able
24233 ^ to go out,
24234 ^ if not by prayer.”
24238 ^ from there
24239 ^ having gone forth, they were passing through - galilee;
24244 ^ and not did he want
24247 ^ that anyone should know [it];
24250 ^ he was teaching for the disciples of him,
24255 ^ and he was saying to them
24258 ^ -, the son - of man is delivered into [the] hands of men,
24267 ^ and they will kill him;
24270 ^ and
24271 ^ having been killed, on the third day he will arise.
24276 ^ - and they did not understand the saying,
24281 ^ and they were afraid
24283 ^ him to ask.
24285 ^ and they came to capernaum.
24289 ^ and
24290 ^ in the house having been, he was asking them,
24296 ^ what on the way were you discussing?
24301 ^ - and they were silent,
24304 ^ with one another for they had been discussing along the road
24311 ^ which [was] greatest.
24313 ^ and
24314 ^ having sat down, he called the twelve,
24318 ^ and he says to them,
24321 ^ if anyone desires
24324 ^ first to be,
24326 ^ he will be of all last and of all servant.
24332 ^ and
24333 ^ having taken a child, he set it in midst of them;
24340 ^ and
24341 ^ having taken in [his] arms it, he said to them,
24345 ^ whoever - one - of such little children shall receive in the name of me, me receives;
24358 ^ and
24359 ^ whoever - me shall receive, not me receives,
24366 ^ but
24367 ^ the [one] having sent me.
24370 ^ answered him - john,
24374 ^ teacher, we saw someone
24377 ^ in the name of you casting out demons,
24383 ^ and we were forbidding him,
24386 ^ because not he was following us.
24390 ^ - and
24392 ^ jesus said,
24394 ^ not forbid him.
24397 ^ no one for there is
24400 ^ who will do a work of power in the name of me,
24407 ^ and will be able
24409 ^ readily to speak evil of me.
24412 ^ whoever for not is against us, for us is.
24421 ^ whoever for - might give to drink you a cup of water, in name
24430 ^ because christ’s you are,
24433 ^ truly i say to you,
24436 ^ that no not shall he lose the reward of him.
24443 ^ and whoever - might cause to stumble one of the little ones these
24451 ^ - believing in me,
24455 ^ better it is for him rather
24459 ^ if is put a millstone heavy around the neck of him
24467 ^ and he has been cast into the sea.
24472 ^ and if should cause to stumble you the hand of you,
24479 ^ cut off it;
24481 ^ better it is
24483 ^ for you crippled to enter into - life,
24489 ^ than
24785 ^ whoever - not shall receive the kingdom - of god as a child, no not shall enter into it.
24800 ^ and
24801 ^ having taken [them] in arms, them he was blessing,
24804 ^ having laid the hands on them.
24809 ^ and going forth of him on [the] journey,
24814 ^ having run up one
24816 ^ and having knelt down to him, was asking him,
24821 ^ teacher good, what shall i do,
24825 ^ that life eternal i might inherit?
24829 ^ - and
24831 ^ jesus said to him,
24834 ^ why me call you good?
24838 ^ no one [is] good,
24840 ^ if not alone - god.
24845 ^ the commandments you know:
24848 ^ not shall you murder,
24850 ^ not shall you commit adultery,
24852 ^ not shall you steal,
24854 ^ not shall you bear false witness,
24856 ^ not shall you defraud,
24858 ^ you shall honor the father of you and the mother.’
24865 ^ - and he was saying to him,
24869 ^ teacher, these all i have kept from [the] youth of me.
24876 ^ - and
24878 ^ jesus,
24879 ^ having looked upon him, loved him
24883 ^ and said to him,
24886 ^ one thing to you is lacking.
24889 ^ go,
25106 ^ those then
25108 ^ following were afraid.
25110 ^ and
25111 ^ having taken to [him] again the twelve, he began
25116 ^ them to tell
25118 ^ the things being about
25120 ^ to him to happen:
25122 ^ - behold,
25124 ^ we go up to jerusalem,
25127 ^ and the son - of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes,
25138 ^ and they will condemn him to death,
25142 ^ and will betray him to the gentiles.
25147 ^ and they will mock him,
25150 ^ and will spit upon him,
25153 ^ and will flog him,
25156 ^ and will kill,
25158 ^ and on the third day he will rise again.
25163 ^ and come up to him james and john, the sons of zebedee,
25172 ^ saying to him,
25174 ^ teacher, we desire
25176 ^ that
25177 ^ whatever if we might ask you, you would do for us.
25183 ^ - and he said to them,
25258 ^ - but
25260 ^ to sit at [the] right hand of me or at [the] left hand, not is
25269 ^ mine to give,
25271 ^ but [to those]
25272 ^ for whom it has been prepared.
25274 ^ and
25275 ^ having heard [this], the ten began
25279 ^ to be indignant about james and john.
25284 ^ and
25285 ^ having called near them, - jesus says to them,
25291 ^ you know
25292 ^ that
25293 ^ those being accounted
25295 ^ to rule over the gentiles exercise lordship over them;
25300 ^ and those great ones of them exercise authority over them.
25306 ^ not thus however shall it be among you.
25312 ^ instead,
25313 ^ whoever - desires
25316 ^ great to become among you, will be your servant;
25323 ^ and
25324 ^ whoever - desires
25327 ^ among you to become first, will be of all slave.
25334 ^ even for the son - of man not came
25342 ^ to be served,
25343 ^ but to serve,
25345 ^ and to give the life of him [as] a ransom for many.
25353 ^ and they come to jericho.
25357 ^ and as was going out he from jericho —
25362 ^ and the disciples of him, and a crowd large —
25369 ^ the son of timaeus, bartimaeus, blind beggar, was sitting beside the road.
25379 ^ and
25380 ^ having heard
25381 ^ that jesus of nazareth it is, he began
25387 ^ to cry out
25388 ^ and to say,
25390 ^ son of david, jesus, have mercy on me.
25395 ^ and were rebuking him many
25399 ^ that he should be silent;
25401 ^ - but much more he kept crying out,
25406 ^ son of david, have mercy on me.
25410 ^ and
25411 ^ having stopped, - jesus commanded
25415 ^ to be called him.
25417 ^ and they call the blind [man],
25421 ^ saying to him,
25423 ^ take courage!
25424 ^ rise up!
25425 ^ he calls you.
25427 ^ - and
25429 ^ having cast away the cloak of him,
25433 ^ having risen up, he came to - jesus.
25438 ^ and
25439 ^ answering him, - jesus says,
26907 ^ to be accomplished
26908 ^ all?
26909 ^ - and
26911 ^ jesus began
26913 ^ to say to them,
26915 ^ take heed,
26916 ^ lest anyone you mislead.
26920 ^ many will come in the name of me,
26926 ^ saying
26927 ^ -, i am [he],
26930 ^ and many they will mislead.
26933 ^ when then you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars,
26940 ^ not be disturbed;
26942 ^ it must
26943 ^ come to pass,
26944 ^ but not yet [is] the end.
26948 ^ will rise up for nation against nation,
26953 ^ and kingdom against kingdom.
26957 ^ there will be earthquakes throughout places;
26961 ^ there will be famines.
26963 ^ [the] beginning of birth pains [are] these.
26966 ^ take heed however you to yourselves;
26970 ^ they will betray you to courts
26974 ^ and in synagogues; you will be beaten,
26978 ^ and before governors and kings you will stand because of me, for a testimony to them.
26989 ^ and
26990 ^ to all the nations first it behooves to proclaim the gospel.
26999 ^ and when they might lead away you,
27003 ^ delivering [you] up,
27004 ^ not be anxious beforehand
27006 ^ what you should say,
27008 ^ but whatever if might be given to you, in that - hour,
27017 ^ that speak;
27019 ^ not for are you
27023 ^ those speaking,
27025 ^ but the spirit - holy.
27030 ^ and will deliver up brother, brother to death,
27036 ^ and father, child;
27039 ^ and will rise up children against parents,
27044 ^ and will put to death them.
27047 ^ and you will be
27049 ^ hated by all on account of the name of me;
27056 ^ the [one] however
27058 ^ having endured to [the] end,
27061 ^ he will be saved.
27063 ^ when then you see the abomination of the desolation
27070 ^ standing
27071 ^ where not it should —
27074 ^ the [one] reading, let him understand —
27077 ^ then those in - judea, let them flee to the mountains,
27086 ^ the [one] and
27088 ^ upon the housetop, not let him come down,
27093 ^ nor go in
27095 ^ to take anything out of the house of him;
27101 ^ and the [one] in the field, not let him return to the things behind,
27111 ^ to take the clothing of him.
27115 ^ woe then
27117 ^ to those in womb
27120 ^ having,
27121 ^ and to the [ones] nursing infants in those - days!
27128 ^ pray then
27130 ^ that it not might be in winter;
27134 ^ will be [in] for the days those tribulation,
27140 ^ such as never has been the like, from [the] beginning of creation,
27147 ^ which created - god, until - now —
27154 ^ and never not shall be.
27158 ^ and if not had shortened [the] lord the days,
27165 ^ no - there would have been saved any flesh;
27170 ^ but on account of the elect
27174 ^ whom he chose, he has shortened the days.
27179 ^ and then if anyone to you says,
27185 ^ behold,
27186 ^ here [is] the christ!
27189 ^ behold,
27190 ^ there!
27191 ^ not you shall believe [it].
27193 ^ there will arise for false christs and false prophets,
27198 ^ and will give signs and wonders,
27203 ^ so as - to deceive
27206 ^ if possible, the elect.
27210 ^ you however take heed;
27213 ^ i have foretold to you all things.
27216 ^ but in those - days, after the tribulation those, the sun will be darkened,
27228 ^ and the moon not will give the light of it;
27236 ^ and the stars will be
27240 ^ out of the heaven falling,
27244 ^ and the powers that [are] in the heavens will be shaken.’
27252 ^ and then will they see the son - of man
27259 ^ coming in [the] clouds, with power great and glory.
27267 ^ and then he will send the angels,
27272 ^ and will gather together the elect of him, from the four winds, from [the] end of earth to [the] end of heaven.
27287 ^ of now
27289 ^ the fig tree, learn the parable:
27294 ^ when already the branch of it tender has become,
27301 ^ and it puts forth the leaves,
27305 ^ you know
27306 ^ that near the summer is.
27311 ^ so also you,
27314 ^ when you see these things
27317 ^ coming to pass, know
27319 ^ that near he is, at [the] doors.
27324 ^ truly i say to you
27327 ^ that no not will have passed away the generation this
27334 ^ until that these things all shall have taken place.
27339 ^ the heaven and the earth will pass away,
27345 ^ - but
27347 ^ the words of me in no way not will pass away.
27352 ^ concerning now
27354 ^ the day that, or the hour, no one knows;
27362 ^ not even the angels in heaven,
27367 ^ nor the son,
27370 ^ if not the father.
27374 ^ take heed;
27375 ^ watch;
27376 ^ not you know for
27379 ^ when the time is.
27383 ^ [it is] like a man going on a journey,
27386 ^ having left the house of him,
27390 ^ and having given the servants of him - authority,
27397 ^ to each one the work of him.
27401 ^ and the doorkeeper he commanded
27405 ^ that he should keep watch.
27407 ^ watch therefore —
27409 ^ not you know for
27412 ^ when the master of the house comes,
27418 ^ or at evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or morning —
27426 ^ lest
27427 ^ having come suddenly, he should find you
27431 ^ sleeping.
27750 ^ who is eating with me.
27754 ^ they began
27755 ^ to be grieved
27756 ^ and to say to him one by one,
27762 ^ surely not i?
27764 ^ - and he said to them,
27768 ^ [it is] one of the twelve,
27771 ^ who is dipping with me in the bowl.
27778 ^ for - indeed
27781 ^ the son - of man goes
27785 ^ as it has been written concerning him;
27789 ^ woe however to the man that
27794 ^ by whom the son - of man is betrayed;
27801 ^ better for him [it were]
27803 ^ if not had been born the man that.
27809 ^ and they were eating of them,
28142 ^ the [one] betraying me has drawn near!
28146 ^ and immediately while yet of him speaking,
28151 ^ comes up judas, one of the twelve, and with him a crowd
28160 ^ with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
28173 ^ had given then
28175 ^ the [one] delivering up him a sign to them,
28180 ^ saying:
28181 ^ whomever - i shall kiss,
28184 ^ he is;
28186 ^ seize him
28188 ^ and lead [him] away securely.
28191 ^ and
28192 ^ having arrived,
28193 ^ immediately having come up to him, he says,
28197 ^ rabbi!
28198 ^ and he kissed him.
28201 ^ - and they laid the hands on him
28207 ^ and seized him.
28210 ^ one then,
28212 ^ a certain
28213 ^ of those standing by,
28215 ^ having drawn the sword, struck the servant of the high priest
28223 ^ and cut off of him the ear.
28228 ^ and
28229 ^ answering, - jesus said to them,
28234 ^ as against a robber are you come out with swords and clubs
28242 ^ to capture me?
28244 ^ every day i was with you in the temple
28252 ^ teaching,
28253 ^ and not you did seize me.
28257 ^ but [it is] that may be fulfilled the scriptures.
28262 ^ and
28263 ^ having left him, fled all.
28267 ^ and [a] young man certain was following him,
28272 ^ having cast a linen cloth about [his] naked [body];
28276 ^ and they seize him,
28279 ^ - and
28281 ^ having left behind the linen cloth, naked he fled.
28286 ^ and they led away - jesus to the high priest.
28293 ^ and come together all the chief priests, and the elders, and the scribes.
28304 ^ and - peter from afar off followed him, as far as within to the court of the high priest;
28318 ^ and he was
28320 ^ sitting with the officers
28324 ^ and warming himself at the fire.
28329 ^ - and
28331 ^ the chief priests and all the council were seeking against - jesus testimony,
28341 ^ to - put to death him,
28345 ^ but not they were finding [any].
28348 ^ many for were bearing false testimony against him,
28353 ^ but alike their testimonies not were.
28359 ^ and some
28361 ^ having risen up, were bearing false testimony against him,
28365 ^ saying,
28366 ^ - we heard him
28370 ^ saying
28371 ^ -, i will destroy the temple this, the [one] made with hands,
28379 ^ and in three days another, not made with hands, i will build.
28386 ^ and neither thus alike was the testimony of them.
28394 ^ and
28395 ^ having stood up the high priest in the midst, he questioned - jesus,
28403 ^ saying,
28404 ^ not answer you nothing?
28407 ^ what [is it] these you testify against?
28411 ^ - but he was silent,
28414 ^ and not did he answer nothing.
28418 ^ again the high priest was questioning him,
28423 ^ and says to him,
28426 ^ you are the christ, the son of the blessed [one]?
28434 ^ - and
28436 ^ jesus said,
28438 ^ i am.
28440 ^ and you will see the son - of man
28446 ^ at [the] right hand sitting
28449 ^ of power,
28451 ^ and coming with the clouds of heaven.
28458 ^ - and
28460 ^ the high priest,
28461 ^ having torn the garments of him, says,
28466 ^ what any more need have we
28470 ^ of witnesses?
28471 ^ you heard the blasphemy.
28474 ^ what to you does it appear?
28477 ^ - and
28479 ^ all condemned
28481 ^ him deserving to be
28484 ^ of death.
28485 ^ and began some
28488 ^ to spit upon him,
28490 ^ and to cover up of him the face,
28495 ^ and to strike him,
28498 ^ and to say to him,
28501 ^ prophesy!
28502 ^ and the officers with the palms him received.
28508 ^ and being - peter below in the courtyard,
28516 ^ comes one of the servant girls of the high priest,
28522 ^ and
28523 ^ having seen - peter
28526 ^ warming himself,
28527 ^ having looked at him, she says,
28530 ^ also you with the nazarene were,
28536 ^ - jesus.
28538 ^ - but he denied [it],
28541 ^ saying,
28542 ^ neither i know,
28544 ^ nor even understand
28546 ^ you what say.
28549 ^ and he went forth out into the porch;
28555 ^ and the rooster crowed.
28558 ^ and the servant girl,
28561 ^ having seen him, began
28564 ^ again to say
28566 ^ to those standing by
28568 ^ -, this [one] of them is.
28573 ^ - but again he denied.
28577 ^ and after a little, again
28581 ^ those standing by were saying - to peter,
28586 ^ truly of them you are,
28590 ^ also for a galilean you are.”
28594 ^ - but he began
28597 ^ to curse
28598 ^ and to swear
28600 ^ -, not i know the man this,
28606 ^ whom you speak of!
28608 ^ and immediately for the second time a rooster crowed.
28614 ^ and remembered - peter the word
28620 ^ that had said to him - jesus
28625 ^ -, before [the] rooster crows, twice
28630 ^ three times me you will deny.
28633 ^ and
28634 ^ having broken down, he began to weep.
28636 ^ and early in the morning,
28639 ^ a counsel having formed the chief priests, with the elders, and scribes, and all the council,
28652 ^ having bound - jesus, they led [him] away
28656 ^ and delivered [him] to pilate.
28659 ^ and questioned him - pilate,
28664 ^ you are the king of the jews?
28670 ^ - and
28672 ^ answering to him, he says,
28675 ^ you have said.
28677 ^ and were accusing him the chief priests of many things.
28683 ^ - and
28685 ^ pilate again began to question him,
28689 ^ saying,
28690 ^ not answer you nothing?
28693 ^ see
28694 ^ how many things you they testify against!
28697 ^ - but
28699 ^ jesus no longer nothing answered,
28703 ^ so as to amaze - pilate.
28707 ^ at then
28709 ^ [the] feast, he used to release to them one prisoner,
28714 ^ whom they requested.
28716 ^ there was then
28718 ^ the [one] called barabbas,
28721 ^ with the rebels having been bound,
28725 ^ who in the insurrection murder had committed.
28731 ^ and
28732 ^ having cried out, the crowd began
28736 ^ to beg [him to do]
28737 ^ as usually he did for them.
28740 ^ - but
28742 ^ pilate answered them,
28745 ^ saying,
28746 ^ wish you [that]
28747 ^ i should release to you the king of the jews?
28753 ^ he was aware for
28755 ^ that because of envy had delivered up him the chief priests.
28762 ^ - but
28764 ^ the chief priests stirred up the crowd
28768 ^ so that instead - barabbas he might release to them.
28774 ^ - and
28776 ^ pilate
28777 ^ again answering, was saying to them,
28781 ^ what then do you wish [that]
28784 ^ i should do
28785 ^ to him you call the king of the jews?
28791 ^ - and again they cried out,
28795 ^ crucify him!
28797 ^ - and
28799 ^ pilate was saying to them,
28802 ^ what indeed did he commit
28805 ^ evil?
28806 ^ - but much more they shouted,
28810 ^ crucify him!
28812 ^ - and
28814 ^ pilate,
28815 ^ desiring
28816 ^ to the crowd that which [was] satisfactory to do, released to them - barabbas,
28825 ^ and he delivered - jesus,
28829 ^ having flogged [him],
28830 ^ that he might be crucified.
28832 ^ - and
28834 ^ the soldiers led away him into the palace,
28840 ^ that is [the] praetorium,
28843 ^ and they call together all the cohort.
28848 ^ and they put on him purple,
28852 ^ and placed on him,
28855 ^ having twisted together of thorns a crown,
28858 ^ and they began
28860 ^ to salute him,
28862 ^ hail, king of the jews!
28866 ^ and they kept striking his - head with a reed,
28872 ^ and spitting on him;
28875 ^ and,
28876 ^ bending the knees, they were kneeling down to him.
28881 ^ and when they had mocked him,
28885 ^ they took off him the purple
28889 ^ and put on him the garments his
28895 ^ and they are leading out him,
28898 ^ that they might crucify him.
28901 ^ and they compel,
28903 ^ passing by one, simon of cyrene,
28907 ^ coming from the country, the father of alexander and rufus,
28915 ^ that he might carry the cross of him.
28920 ^ and they bring him to - golgotha, a place
28927 ^ which is
28929 ^ translated, of a skull place.
28932 ^ and they were offering him,
28935 ^ having been mixed with myrrh, wine;
28937 ^ he however not did take [it].
28941 ^ and having crucified him,
28944 ^ also they divided the garments of him,
28949 ^ casting lots for them,
28953 ^ who what should take.
28956 ^ it was then [the] hour third,
28960 ^ and they crucified him.
28963 ^ and there was the inscription of the accusation against him
28970 ^ having been written:
28971 ^ the king of the jews.
28975 ^ and with him they crucify two robbers, one at [the] right hand, and one at [the] left of him.
28989 ^ and
28990 ^ those passing by were railing at him,
28994 ^ shaking the heads of them
28998 ^ and saying,
29000 ^ aha!
29001 ^ the [one] destroying the temple
29005 ^ and building [it] in three days,
29010 ^ save yourself,
29012 ^ having descended from the cross!
29016 ^ likewise also the chief priests,
29020 ^ mocking among one another, with the scribes, were saying,
29027 ^ others he saved;
29536 ^ the [one] however
29538 ^ having disbelieved will be condemned.
29540 ^ signs now
29542 ^ those having believed
29544 ^ these will accompany:
29546 ^ in the name of me demons they will cast out;
29552 ^ with tongues they will speak
29554 ^ new;
29555 ^ and with their hands serpents they will take up;
29561 ^ and if deadly anything they drink,
29565 ^ no not them shall it hurt;
29569 ^ upon [the] sick, hands they will lay,
29573 ^ and well they will be.
29576 ^ - indeed therefore
29579 ^ the lord jesus,
29581 ^ after - speaking to them, was taken up into the heaven
29589 ^ and sat at [the] right hand - of god.
29595 ^ they now
29597 ^ having gone forth, preached everywhere,
29600 ^ the lord working with [them]
29603 ^ and the word confirming by the
29609 ^ accompanying signs.
29611 ^ all moreover
31880 ^ the [one] having two tunics, let him impart
31885 ^ to the [one] none
31887 ^ having;
31888 ^ and
31889 ^ the [one] having food, likewise let him do.
31894 ^ came then also tax collectors
31898 ^ to be baptized,
31899 ^ and they said to him,
31903 ^ teacher, what shall we do?
31906 ^ - and he said to them,
31911 ^ nothing more
31913 ^ beyond that having been appointed to you collect.
31918 ^ were asking then him also
31922 ^ those being soldiers,
31923 ^ saying,
31924 ^ what shall do also we?
31928 ^ and he said to them,
31931 ^ no one extort
31933 ^ nor accuse falsely,
31935 ^ and be content with the wages of you.
31940 ^ are expecting then the people
31944 ^ and wondering all in the hearts of them concerning - john,
31954 ^ whether ever he might be the christ.
31959 ^ answered
31960 ^ saying [to] all - john,
31964 ^ i indeed with water baptize you;
31969 ^ comes however the [one] mightier than i,
31974 ^ of whom not i am worthy
31978 ^ to untie the strap of the sandals of him;
31984 ^ he you will baptize with [the] spirit holy, and with fire,
31992 ^ of whom the winnowing fork [is] in the hand of him,
31999 ^ to clear the threshing floor of him
32003 ^ and to gather the wheat into the barn of him.
32011 ^ - but
32013 ^ the chaff he will burn up with fire unquenchable.
33860 ^ which not it is lawful to eat,
33864 ^ if not only to the priests?
33869 ^ and he was saying to them,
33872 ^ lord is
33874 ^ of the sabbath the son - of man.
33880 ^ it came to pass then on another sabbath,
33885 ^ entered he into the synagogue
33890 ^ and taught;
33892 ^ and there was a man there,
33896 ^ and the hand of him the right was withered.
33904 ^ were closely watching now him the scribes and the pharisees,
33912 ^ whether on the sabbath he will heal,
33917 ^ that they might find [reason]
33919 ^ to accuse him.
33921 ^ he now knew the thoughts of them;
33927 ^ he said now to the man
33931 ^ the withered
33933 ^ having
33934 ^ the hand,
33936 ^ arise
33937 ^ and stand in the midst.
33942 ^ and
33943 ^ having risen up, he stood.
33945 ^ said then - jesus to them,
33951 ^ i ask you,
33953 ^ whether it is lawful on the sabbath
33957 ^ to do good
33958 ^ or to do evil?
33960 ^ life to save
33962 ^ or to destroy?
33964 ^ and
33965 ^ having looked around all on them, he said to him,
33970 ^ stretch out the hand of you.
33974 ^ - and he did,
33977 ^ and was restored the hand of him.
33982 ^ they themselves then were filled with rage,
33986 ^ and were discussing with one another
33990 ^ what - they might do - to jesus.
33995 ^ it came to pass then in the days those,
34001 ^ went out he to the mountain
34006 ^ to pray,
34007 ^ and he was
34009 ^ spending the night in - prayer - to god.
34015 ^ and when it became day,
34019 ^ he called to [him] the disciples of him,
34023 ^ also having chosen out from them twelve,
34028 ^ whom also apostles he named:
34032 ^ simon
34033 ^ whom also he named peter, and andrew the brother of him; and james and john; and philip and bartholomew; and matthew and thomas; and james [son of] alphaeus; and simon
34059 ^ the [one] called zealot; and judas [son] of james; and judas iscariot,
34068 ^ who became [the] betrayer.
34071 ^ and
34072 ^ having descended with them, he stood on a place level,
34079 ^ and a crowd large of disciples of him, and a multitude great of the people from all - judea, and jerusalem, and the sea coast of tyre, and sidon,
34101 ^ who came
34103 ^ to hear him
34105 ^ and to be healed of the diseases of them.
34111 ^ and
34112 ^ those troubled with spirits unclean were healed.
34118 ^ and all the multitude were seeking
34123 ^ to touch him,
34125 ^ because power from him was going out
34130 ^ and healing all.
34133 ^ and he,
34135 ^ having lifted up the gaze of him upon the disciples of him, was saying:
34144 ^ blessed [are] the poor,
34147 ^ for yours is the kingdom - of god.
34154 ^ blessed [are]
34155 ^ those hungering now,
34158 ^ for you will be filled.
34160 ^ blessed [are]
34161 ^ those weeping now,
34164 ^ for you will laugh.
34166 ^ blessed are you
34168 ^ when shall hate you - men,
34173 ^ and when they shall exclude you,
34177 ^ and shall insult [you],
34179 ^ and shall cast out the name of you as evil, on account of the son - of man.
34191 ^ rejoice in that - day,
34196 ^ and leap for joy;
34198 ^ behold for,
34200 ^ the reward of you [is] great in - heaven.
34207 ^ according to these things of them for used to treat the prophets the fathers likewise.
34217 ^ but woe to you who are rich,
34222 ^ for you are receiving the comfort of you.
34227 ^ woe to you
34229 ^ who having been filled now,
34232 ^ for you will hunger.
34234 ^ woe to
34235 ^ those laughing now,
34238 ^ for you will mourn
34240 ^ and will weep.
34242 ^ woe to you
34243 ^ when of you well speak all - men,
34250 ^ according to these things of them for used to treat the false prophets the fathers likewise.
34260 ^ but to you i say,
34758 ^ - and having come to - jesus, they were begging him earnestly,
34767 ^ saying
34768 ^ that, worthy he is,
34771 ^ to whom you will grant this;
34774 ^ he loves for the nation of us,
34779 ^ and the synagogue he built for us.
34785 ^ - and
34787 ^ jesus was going with them.
34791 ^ already then, he not far being distant from the house,
34800 ^ sent friends the centurion,
34804 ^ saying to him,
34806 ^ lord, not trouble yourself,
34809 ^ not for worthy i am
34813 ^ that under the roof of me you should come;
34819 ^ therefore neither myself counted i worthy
34823 ^ to you to come;
34826 ^ but say in a word,
34829 ^ and shall be healed the servant of me.
34834 ^ also for i a man am
34839 ^ under authority appointed,
34842 ^ having under me soldiers;
34846 ^ and i say to this [one],
34849 ^ go,
34850 ^ and he goes;
34852 ^ and to another,
34854 ^ come,
34855 ^ and he comes;
34857 ^ and to [the] servant of me,
34861 ^ do this,
34863 ^ and he does [it].
34964 ^ those then bearing [it] stopped.
34968 ^ and he said,
34970 ^ young man, to you i say,
34973 ^ arise!
34974 ^ and sat up the dead [man],
34978 ^ and began
34980 ^ to speak,
34981 ^ and he gave him to the mother of him.
34987 ^ seized then fear all,
34991 ^ and they began glorifying - god,
34995 ^ saying
34996 ^ -, a prophet great has risen up among us!
35002 ^ and -, has visited - god the people of him!
35010 ^ and went out the report this in all - judea concerning him,
35021 ^ and in all the surrounding region.
35025 ^ and brought word to john the disciples of him concerning all these things.
35034 ^ and
35035 ^ having called near two certain - disciples of him, - john sent [them] to the lord,
35047 ^ saying,
35048 ^ you are
35050 ^ the coming [one],
35052 ^ or another are we to look for?
35160 ^ those in clothing splendid and in luxury
35166 ^ living, in the palaces are.
35171 ^ but
35172 ^ what have you gone out to see?
35175 ^ a prophet?
35176 ^ yes,
35177 ^ i say to you,
35179 ^ and [one] more excellent than a prophet.
35182 ^ this is he
35184 ^ concerning whom it has been written:
35187 ^ behold,
35188 ^ i send the messenger of me before [the] face of you,
35195 ^ who will prepare the way of you before you.’
35202 ^ i say to you,
35204 ^ a greater among [those] born of women
35208 ^ than john no one is;
35211 ^ - yet
35213 ^ the least in the kingdom of god, greater than he is.
35222 ^ and all the people
35226 ^ having heard,
35227 ^ even the tax collectors, declared as righteous - god,
35233 ^ having been baptized [with] the baptism of john;
35237 ^ - but
35239 ^ the pharisees and the lawyers, the counsel - of god rejected as to themselves,
35250 ^ not having been baptized by him.
35254 ^ to what therefore will i liken the men of the generation this?
35262 ^ and to what are they
35265 ^ like?
35266 ^ like are they
35268 ^ to little children
35269 ^ - in the marketplace
35272 ^ sitting,
35273 ^ and calling to each other
35276 ^ one, saying:
35278 ^ we piped to you,
35280 ^ and not you did dance;
35283 ^ we sang a dirge,
35284 ^ and not you did weep.
35287 ^ has come for john the baptist,
35292 ^ neither eating bread,
35295 ^ nor drinking wine,
35298 ^ and you say,
35300 ^ a demon he has.
35302 ^ has come the son - of man,
35307 ^ eating
35308 ^ and drinking,
35310 ^ and you say,
35312 ^ behold,
35313 ^ a man, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and of sinners.
35321 ^ and was justified - wisdom by all the children of her.
35330 ^ was asking now one him
35334 ^ of the pharisees,
35336 ^ that he should eat with him;
35340 ^ and
35341 ^ having entered into the house of the pharisee, he reclined.
35348 ^ and behold,
35350 ^ a woman
35351 ^ who was in the city, a sinner.
35357 ^ and
35358 ^ she having known
35359 ^ that he had reclined in the house of the pharisee,
35366 ^ having taken an alabaster flask of fragrant oil,
35369 ^ and having stood behind him at the feet of him
35376 ^ weeping,
35377 ^ the tears she began to wet with the feet of him,
35384 ^ and with the hairs of the head of her, she was wiping [them],
35391 ^ and was kissing the feet of him,
35396 ^ and was anointing [them] with the fragrant oil.
35563 ^ to whom however little is forgiven, little he loves.
35569 ^ he said then to her,
35572 ^ have been forgiven your - sins.
35576 ^ and began
35578 ^ those reclining
35580 ^ to say within themselves,
35583 ^ who this is
35586 ^ who even sins forgives?
35590 ^ he said then to the woman,
35595 ^ the faith of you has saved you;
35600 ^ go in peace.
35603 ^ and it came to pass afterward - soon,
35608 ^ that he was traveling throughout city and village,
35615 ^ preaching
35616 ^ and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom - of god.
35622 ^ and the twelve [were] with him,
35627 ^ and women certain
35630 ^ who had been
35632 ^ cured from spirits evil and infirmities: mary
35639 ^ who is called magdalene,
35642 ^ from whom demons seven had gone out; and joanna wife of chuza, a steward of herod, and susanna, and others many,
35658 ^ who were ministering to them
35661 ^ out of the means their own.
35665 ^ [as] is assembling now a crowd great,
35669 ^ and those from each town
35673 ^ are coming to him,
35676 ^ he spoke by a parable:
35679 ^ went out
35680 ^ the [one] sowing
35682 ^ - to sow the seed of him.
35687 ^ and
35688 ^ in the sowing of him, some indeed fell along the road,
35698 ^ and it was trampled upon,
35700 ^ and the birds of the air devoured it.
35707 ^ and other fell upon the rock,
35713 ^ and
35714 ^ having sprung up it withered
35716 ^ through - no
35719 ^ having moisture.
35721 ^ and other fell in [the] midst of the thorns,
35728 ^ and
35729 ^ having sprung up with [it], the thorns choked it.
35734 ^ and other fell upon the soil - good,
35742 ^ and
35743 ^ having sprung up, it produced fruit a hundredfold.
35750 ^ the [one] having ears
35753 ^ to hear, let him hear.
35755 ^ were asking then him the disciples of him,
35761 ^ what this means,
35764 ^ the parable?
35766 ^ - and he said,
35769 ^ to you it has been given
35771 ^ to know the mysteries of the kingdom - of god;
35778 ^ to however
35780 ^ [the] rest, [it is] in parables,
35783 ^ so that,
35784 ^ seeing, not may they see;
35787 ^ and
35788 ^ hearing, not may they understand.’
35791 ^ is now this the parable:
35796 ^ the seed is the word - of god.
35803 ^ those now
35805 ^ along the road are
35809 ^ those having heard;
35811 ^ then comes the devil
35815 ^ and takes away the word from the heart of them,
35823 ^ that not
35825 ^ having believed they should be saved.
35827 ^ those now
35829 ^ upon the rock,
35832 ^ those who when they hear,
35835 ^ with joy receive the word,
35840 ^ and these a root not have,
35845 ^ who for a time believe,
35849 ^ and in time of testing fall away.
35854 ^ that now into the thorns
35859 ^ having fallen,
35860 ^ these are
35862 ^ those having heard,
35864 ^ and under cares, and riches, and pleasures - of life,
35873 ^ moving along are choked,
35875 ^ and not do mature.
35878 ^ that now
35880 ^ in the good soil,
35884 ^ these are
35886 ^ those in a heart worthy and good,
35892 ^ having heard the word keep [it],
35896 ^ and bring forth fruit by perseverance.
35900 ^ no one now
35902 ^ a lamp having lighted, covers it with a vessel,
35907 ^ or under a bed puts [it],
35911 ^ but on a lampstand puts [it],
35915 ^ so that
35916 ^ those entering in may see the light.
35921 ^ nothing for is hidden
35925 ^ which not manifest will become,
35929 ^ nor secret
35931 ^ which nothing not shall be known,
35935 ^ and to light come.
35939 ^ take heed therefore
35941 ^ how you hear;
35943 ^ whoever - for might have,
35947 ^ will be given to him;
35949 ^ and whoever - not might have,
35954 ^ even
37111 ^ whoever for - might desire
37115 ^ the life of him to save, will lose it;
37121 ^ whoever however - might lose the life of him on account of me,
37130 ^ he will save it.
37133 ^ what for is profited a man,
37137 ^ having gained the world whole,
37141 ^ himself now having destroyed,
37144 ^ or having suffered the loss of?
37146 ^ whoever for - may have been ashamed of me and - my words,
37155 ^ him the son - of man will be ashamed of
37161 ^ when he shall come in the glory of himself, and of the father, and of the holy angels.
37174 ^ i say now to you
37177 ^ truthfully, there are some
37180 ^ of those here
37182 ^ standing,
37183 ^ who no not shall taste of death
37188 ^ until - they shall have seen the kingdom - of god.
37195 ^ it came to pass now after the sayings these, about days eight,
37204 ^ and
37205 ^ having taken peter and john and james, he went up on the mountain
37215 ^ to pray.
37216 ^ and it came to pass
37218 ^ in the praying of him,
37222 ^ the appearance of the face of him [was] altered,
37228 ^ and the clothing of him white
37233 ^ became dazzling.
37234 ^ and behold,
37236 ^ men two began talking with him,
37240 ^ who were moses and elijah.
37245 ^ those
37246 ^ having appeared in glory were speaking of the going out of him,
37580 ^ whoever if shall receive this - child in the name of me, me receives;
37592 ^ and
37593 ^ whoever - me shall receive, receives
37598 ^ the [one] having sent me.
37601 ^ the [one] for least among all you being,
37608 ^ he shall be great.
37640 ^ whoever for not is against you, for you is.
37649 ^ it came to pass then
37651 ^ in the completing the days of the ascension of him,
37659 ^ that he the face steadfastly set
37664 ^ - to go to jerusalem.
37668 ^ and he sent messengers before [the] face of him.
37674 ^ and
37675 ^ having gone, they entered into a village of the samaritans,
37680 ^ so as to make ready for him.
37683 ^ and not they did receive him,
37687 ^ because the face of him was [as]
37692 ^ going toward jerusalem.
38101 ^ the [one] hearing you, me hears;
38106 ^ and
38107 ^ the [one] rejecting you, me rejects;
38112 ^ the [one] now me rejecting, rejects
38117 ^ the [one] having sent me.
38120 ^ returned then the seventy two with joy,
38127 ^ saying,
38128 ^ lord, even the demons are subject to us through the name of you.
38138 ^ he said then to them,
38141 ^ i beheld - satan
38144 ^ as lightning out of the heaven having fallen.
38150 ^ behold,
38151 ^ i give you the authority
38155 ^ - to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and upon all the power of the enemy,
38168 ^ and nothing you no not will injure.
38174 ^ yet in this not rejoice,
38179 ^ that the spirits to you are subjected;
38184 ^ rejoice however
38186 ^ that the names of you are written in the heavens.
38194 ^ in the same - hour, he rejoiced in the spirit - holy
38204 ^ and said,
38206 ^ i fully consent to you, father, lord of the heaven and of the earth,
38215 ^ that you have hidden these things from wise and intelligent,
38222 ^ and have revealed them to little children;
38226 ^ yes, - father,
38229 ^ for thus well-pleasing was it before you.
38235 ^ all things to me have been delivered by the father of me.
38242 ^ and no one knows
38245 ^ who is the son,
38249 ^ if not the father;
38253 ^ and
38254 ^ who is the father,
38258 ^ if not the son,
38262 ^ and
38263 ^ to whom if might resolve the son to reveal [him].
38269 ^ and
38270 ^ having turned to the disciples in private, he said,
38277 ^ blessed [are] the eyes
38280 ^ - seeing
38282 ^ what you see!
38284 ^ i say for to you
38287 ^ that many prophets and kings desired
38293 ^ to see
38294 ^ what you see,
38297 ^ and not saw;
38300 ^ and
38301 ^ to hear
38302 ^ what you hear,
38304 ^ and not heard.
38307 ^ and behold,
38309 ^ a lawyer certain stood up,
38312 ^ testing him,
38314 ^ saying,
38315 ^ teacher,
38316 ^ what having done, life eternal will i inherit?
38321 ^ - and he said to him,
38326 ^ in the law what has been written?
38331 ^ how read you?
38333 ^ - and
38335 ^ answering, he said,
38337 ^ you shall love [the] lord the god of you with all the heart of you, and with all the soul of you, and with all the strength of you, and with all the mind of you’
38365 ^ and the neighbor of you
38369 ^ as yourself.’
38371 ^ he said then to him,
38374 ^ correctly you have answered.
38376 ^ this do,
38378 ^ and you will live.
38380 ^ - but
38382 ^ desiring
38383 ^ to justify himself, he said to - jesus,
38389 ^ and who is my neighbor?
38504 ^ which of these - three a neighbor seems to you to have been
38512 ^ of the [one] having fallen among the robbers?
38517 ^ - and he said,
38520 ^ the [one] having shown - compassion toward him.
38526 ^ said then to him - jesus,
38531 ^ go
38532 ^ and you do likewise.
38800 ^ everyone for - asking receives;
38805 ^ and
38806 ^ the [one] seeking finds;
38809 ^ and
38810 ^ to the [one] knocking, it will be opened.
38813 ^ which now
38815 ^ of you who [is] a father, will ask for the son a fish,
38823 ^ and instead of a fish, a serpent to him will he give?
38829 ^ or also [if] he will ask for an egg,
38833 ^ will he give to him a scorpion?
38836 ^ if therefore you,
38839 ^ evil being, know
38842 ^ gifts good to give to the children of you,
38848 ^ how much more the father who [is] in heaven will give [the] spirit holy
38858 ^ to those asking him!
38861 ^ and he was
38863 ^ casting out a demon,
38865 ^ and it was mute;
38869 ^ it came to pass then
38871 ^ the demon having gone out,
38874 ^ spoke the mute [man].
38877 ^ and marveled the crowds.
38881 ^ some then
38883 ^ of them said,
38886 ^ by beelzebul the prince of the demons he casts out the demons.
38895 ^ others now,
38897 ^ testing, a sign from heaven were seeking from him.
38904 ^ he now,
38906 ^ knowing their - thoughts, said to them,
38912 ^ every kingdom
38914 ^ against itself having been divided is brought to desolation;
38918 ^ and a house against a house falls.
38923 ^ if now also - satan against himself is divided,
38931 ^ how will stand the kingdom of him?
38936 ^ for you say,
38938 ^ by beelzebul cast out i the demons.
38944 ^ if now i by beelzebul cast out the demons,
38952 ^ the sons of you, by whom do they cast out?
38958 ^ on account of this, they of you judges will be.
38964 ^ if however by [the] finger of god i cast out the demons,
38973 ^ then has come upon you the kingdom - of god.
38981 ^ when the strong [man]
38984 ^ being armed might guard - his house,
38989 ^ in peace are
38992 ^ the possessions of him;
38995 ^ when however [one] stronger than he,
38999 ^ having come upon [him], shall overcome him,
39002 ^ the complete armor of him he takes away
39006 ^ in which he had trusted,
39009 ^ and the plunder of him he divides.
39014 ^ the [one] not
39016 ^ being with me against me is;
39022 ^ and
39023 ^ the [one] not
39025 ^ gathering with me scatters.
39029 ^ when the unclean spirit is gone out from the man,
39037 ^ it passes through waterless places
39041 ^ seeking rest;
39043 ^ and
39044 ^ not finding [any], then it says,
39048 ^ i will return to the house of me,
39053 ^ from where i came out.
39055 ^ and
39056 ^ having come, it finds [it]
39058 ^ swept
39059 ^ and put in order.
39061 ^ then it goes
39063 ^ and takes other spirits more evil than itself, seven,
39070 ^ and
39071 ^ having entered, they dwell there;
39074 ^ and becomes the last of the man that worse than the first.
39084 ^ it came to pass then,
39086 ^ in - saying his these things,
39399 ^ these things also it behooved [you] to do,
39403 ^ and those not to neglect.
39406 ^ woe to you - pharisees,
39410 ^ for you love the first seat in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces.
39423 ^ woe to you,
39425 ^ for you are like - graves - unmarked,
39432 ^ and the men
39435 ^ - walking above not have known [it].
39768 ^ the [one] now having denied me before - men, will be denied before the angels - of god.
39781 ^ and everyone who will speak a word against the son - of man,
39791 ^ it will be forgiven him;
39834 ^ what it behooves [you] to say.
39837 ^ said then one from the crowd to him,
39844 ^ teacher, say to the brother of me
39849 ^ to divide with me the inheritance.
39854 ^ - and he said to him,
39858 ^ man, who me appointed a judge or partitioner over you?
39867 ^ he said then to them,
39871 ^ beware
39872 ^ and keep yourselves from all covetousness;
39877 ^ for not
39879 ^ in the abundance to anyone, the life to him is
39887 ^ of that which possesses of him.
39891 ^ he spoke then a parable to them,
39896 ^ saying,
39897 ^ of a man certain rich brought forth abundantly
39901 ^ the ground.
39903 ^ and he was reasoning within himself,
39907 ^ saying,
39908 ^ what shall i do,
39910 ^ for not i have
39913 ^ where i will store up the fruits of me?
39918 ^ and he said,
39920 ^ this will i do:
39922 ^ i will tear down my - barns
39926 ^ and greater will build,
39929 ^ and will store up there all the grain and the goods of me.
39939 ^ and i will say to the soul of me,
39944 ^ soul, you have many good things
39948 ^ laid up for years many;
39952 ^ take your rest;
39953 ^ eat,
39954 ^ drink,
39955 ^ be merry.
39956 ^ said then to him - god,
39961 ^ fool! this - night, the soul of you is required of you;
39971 ^ what now you did prepare — to whom will [it] be?
39976 ^ so [is]
39977 ^ the [one] treasuring up for himself,
39980 ^ and not toward god being rich.
39985 ^ he said then to the disciples of him,
39991 ^ because of this i say to you,
39995 ^ not be anxious for the life,
39999 ^ what you should eat,
40001 ^ nor for the body
40004 ^ what you should put on.
40006 ^ the for
40008 ^ life more than is
40011 ^ the food,
40013 ^ and the body than the clothing.
40018 ^ consider the ravens,
40021 ^ that not they sow
40024 ^ nor reap;
40026 ^ to them not there is a storehouse
40030 ^ nor barn —
40032 ^ and - god feeds them.
40037 ^ how much more you are valuable than the birds!
40043 ^ which now
40045 ^ of you,
40047 ^ being anxious, is able
40049 ^ to the lifespan of him to add one hour?
40055 ^ if then not even
40058 ^ [the] least you are able [to do],
40060 ^ why about the rest are you anxious?
40065 ^ consider the lilies,
40068 ^ how they grow:
40070 ^ not do they labor,

40074 ^ i say however to you,

40209 ^ waiting for the master of themselves,
40213 ^ whenever he shall return from the wedding feasts,
40218 ^ that having come
40220 ^ and having knocked,
40222 ^ immediately they might open to him.
40225 ^ blessed [are] the servants those,

41825 ^ -, this - man began
41830 ^ to build
41831 ^ and not was able
41834 ^ to finish.
41835 ^ or what king,
41838 ^ proceeding with another king
41841 ^ to engage in war, not,

41848 ^ whether able he is
41851 ^ with ten thousand to meet
41855 ^ the [one] with twenty thousand

41923 ^ to him drawing near all the tax collectors and the sinners
43584 ^ whoever if may seek
43587 ^ the life of him to save, will lose it;
43593 ^ whoever also - will lose [it], will preserve it.
43599 ^ i say to you,
43601 ^ in that - night there will be two upon bed one:
43609 ^ the one will be taken,
43612 ^ and the other will be left.
43616 ^ there will be two [women]
43618 ^ grinding at the same [place]:
43622 ^ the one will be taken,
43625 ^ - and
43627 ^ the other will be left.”
43629 ^ and
43630 ^ answering, they say to him,
43633 ^ where, lord?
43635 ^ - and he said to them,
43639 ^ where the body [is],
43642 ^ there also the vultures will be gathered together.
43647 ^ he was speaking then a parable to them
43651 ^ about the [way] it behooves
43654 ^ always to pray them
43657 ^ and not to lose heart,
43660 ^ saying,
43661 ^ a judge certain there was in a certain city,
43667 ^ - god not fearing
43671 ^ and man not respecting.
43675 ^ a widow then there was in the city that,
43682 ^ and she was coming to him,
43686 ^ saying,
43687 ^ avenge me of the adversary of me.
43693 ^ and not he would for a time;
43698 ^ afterward
43699 ^ however
43700 ^ he said within himself,
43704 ^ if even - god not i fear,
43710 ^ nor man respect,
43897 ^ the [one] however humbling himself will be exalted.
43902 ^ they were bringing then to him also the infants,
43908 ^ that them he might touch;
43944 ^ whoever - not shall receive the kingdom - of god as a child, no not shall enter into it.
43959 ^ and asked a certain him
43963 ^ ruler,
43964 ^ saying,
43965 ^ teacher good,
43967 ^ what having done, life eternal will i inherit?
43972 ^ said then to him - jesus,
43977 ^ why me call you good?
43981 ^ no one [is] good,
43983 ^ if not alone - god.
43988 ^ the commandments you know:
43991 ^ not shall you commit adultery,
43993 ^ not shall you murder,
43995 ^ not shall you steal,
43997 ^ not shall you bear false witness,
43999 ^ you shall honor the father of you and the mother.’
44006 ^ - and he said,
44009 ^ these all have i kept from [the] youth
44396 ^ today for in the house of you it behooves
44403 ^ me to stay.
44405 ^ and
44406 ^ having hurried, he came down
44408 ^ and received him,
44411 ^ rejoicing.
44412 ^ and
44413 ^ having seen [it], all were grumbling,
44416 ^ saying
44417 ^ -,
44418 ^ with a sinful man he has entered to stay.
45607 ^ those however having been considered worthy
45610 ^ to the age that which [is] to obtain,

45622 ^ nor are given in marriage;
45624 ^ neither for
45626 ^ to die any more are they able,
45629 ^ like [the] angels for they are;
45632 ^ and sons they are
45635 ^ of god,
45636 ^ of the resurrection sons being.
45640 ^ that however are raised the dead,
45645 ^ even moses showed at the bush,
45651 ^ when he calls
45653 ^ [the] lord the god of abraham, and god of isaac, and god of jacob.’
45663 ^ god now not he is
45667 ^ of [the] dead,
45668 ^ but
45669 ^ of [the] living;
45670 ^ all for to him live.
46444 ^ on which it was necessary for to be sacrificed the passover lamb.
46450 ^ and he sent peter and john,
46455 ^ having said,
49321 ^ the [one] after me
49324 ^ coming, precedence over me has,
49328 ^ because before me he was.’
49332 ^ for from the fullness of him, we all have received
49340 ^ then grace for grace.
49344 ^ for the law through moses was given;
49350 ^ - grace and - truth through jesus christ came.
49359 ^ god no one has seen ever yet;
49363 ^ [the] only begotten god,
49365 ^ the [one] being in the bosom of the father,
49372 ^ he has made [him] known.
49374 ^ and this is the testimony - of john,
49381 ^ when sent to him the jews from jerusalem, priests and levites,
49392 ^ that they might ask him,
49395 ^ you, who are?
49398 ^ and he confessed
49400 ^ and not denied,
49403 ^ but confessed
49405 ^ -, i not am the christ.
49411 ^ and they asked him,
49414 ^ what then? you
49417 ^ elijah are?
49419 ^ and he says,
49421 ^ not i am.
49423 ^ the prophet are you?
49427 ^ and he answered,
49429 ^ no.
49430 ^ they said therefore to him,
49433 ^ who are you?
49435 ^ that an answer we might give
49438 ^ to those having sent us;
49441 ^ what say you about yourself?
49445 ^ he was saying,
49446 ^ i [am] a voice
49448 ^ crying in the wilderness,
49452 ^ make straight the way of [the] lord,’”
49456 ^ as said isaiah the prophet.
49461 ^ and
49462 ^ [those] having been sent were out from the pharisees.
49467 ^ and they asked him
49470 ^ and said to him,
49473 ^ why then baptize you,
49476 ^ if you not are the christ,
49482 ^ nor elijah,
49484 ^ nor the prophet?
49487 ^ answered them - john
49491 ^ saying,
49492 ^ i baptize with water;
49496 ^ but in [the] midst of you stands [one]
49499 ^ whom you not know,
49839 ^ out of nazareth is able any good thing to be?
49845 ^ says to him - philip,
49849 ^ come
49850 ^ and see.
49852 ^ saw - jesus - nathanael
49857 ^ coming to him,
49860 ^ and he says concerning him,
49864 ^ behold
49865 ^ truly an israelite,
49867 ^ in whom deceit not there is.
49872 ^ says to him nathanael,
49875 ^ from where me know you?
49878 ^ answered jesus
49880 ^ and said to him,
50492 ^ that having been born of the flesh, flesh is;
50499 ^ and
50500 ^ that having been born of the spirit, spirit is.
50507 ^ not do wonder
50509 ^ that i said to you,
50512 ^ it is necessary for
50513 ^ you [all] to be born from above.
50516 ^ the wind
50518 ^ where it wishes blows,
50521 ^ and the sound of it you hear,
50526 ^ but not you know
50529 ^ from where it comes,
50531 ^ and where it goes;
50534 ^ thus is
50536 ^ everyone - having been born of the spirit.
50542 ^ answered nicodemus
50544 ^ and said to him,
50547 ^ how are able
50549 ^ these things to be?
50551 ^ answered jesus
50553 ^ and said to him,
50556 ^ you are the teacher - of israel,
50562 ^ and these things not know?
50566 ^ truly, truly, i say to you
50570 ^ that
50571 ^ what we know we speak,
50574 ^ and
50575 ^ what we have seen we bear witness to;
50578 ^ and the witness of us not you people receive.
50584 ^ if things earthly i have told you,
50589 ^ and not you believe,
50592 ^ how
50593 ^ if i tell to you the things heavenly, will you believe?
50599 ^ and no one has gone up into - heaven
50605 ^ if not
50607 ^ the [one] out of - heaven
50611 ^ having come down, the son - of man.
50616 ^ and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,
50625 ^ thus
50626 ^ to be lifted up it behooves the son - of man,
50632 ^ so that
50633 ^ everyone - believing in him may have life eternal.
50641 ^ thus for loved - god the world,
50648 ^ that the son, the only begotten, he gave,
50654 ^ so that
50655 ^ everyone - believing in him not should perish,
50662 ^ but should have life eternal.
50666 ^ not for sent - god - his son into the world
50676 ^ that he might judge the world,
50680 ^ but that might be saved the world through him.
50687 ^ the [one] believing on him not is judged;
50693 ^ the [one] but not believing already has been judged,
50699 ^ because not he has believed in the name of the only begotten son - of god.
50710 ^ this now is the judgement,
50715 ^ that the light has come into the world,
50722 ^ and loved - men rather the darkness
50729 ^ than the light;
50732 ^ were for of them evil
50736 ^ the deeds.
50738 ^ everyone for - evil
50742 ^ practicing hates the light
50746 ^ and not comes to the light,
50752 ^ so that not may be exposed the works of him;
50758 ^ the [one] however practicing the truth comes to the light,
50767 ^ that may be manifest his - works
50772 ^ that
50773 ^ in god have been done.”
50777 ^ after these things came - jesus and the disciples of him into the judean land,
50790 ^ and there he was staying with them,
50795 ^ and was baptizing.
50797 ^ was now also - john
50802 ^ baptizing in aenon, near - salim,
50808 ^ because waters many were there,
50813 ^ and they were coming
50815 ^ and being baptized.
50817 ^ not yet for had been
50820 ^ cast into the prison - john.
50826 ^ arose then a debate among the disciples of john, with [a certain] jew, about purification.
50837 ^ and they came to - john
50842 ^ and said to him,
50845 ^ rabbi,
50846 ^ he who was with you beyond the jordan,
50853 ^ to whom you have borne witness,
50856 ^ behold
50857 ^ he baptizes,
50859 ^ and all are coming to him.
50864 ^ answered john
50866 ^ and said,
50868 ^ nothing is able a man
50871 ^ to receive, nothing one
50874 ^ if not it is
50877 ^ given to him from - heaven.
50882 ^ yourselves you to me bear witness,
50886 ^ that i said,
50888 ^ - not am i the christ,
50894 ^ but -
50896 ^ sent i am before him.
50900 ^ the [one] having the bride, [the] bridegroom is;
50906 ^ the now
50908 ^ friend of the bridegroom,
50911 ^ the [one] standing
50913 ^ and listening for him, with joy rejoices because of the voice of the bridegroom.
50923 ^ this therefore,
50925 ^ the joy - of mine, is fulfilled.
50930 ^ him it behooves
50932 ^ to increase;
50933 ^ me however to decrease.
50936 ^ the [one] from above
50938 ^ coming, above all is.
50942 ^ the [one] being from the earth, from the earth is,
50951 ^ and from the earth speaks.
50956 ^ the [one] from - heaven
50960 ^ coming, above all is.
50964 ^ what he has seen
50966 ^ and heard,
50968 ^ this he testifies;
50970 ^ and the testimony of him, no one receives.
50976 ^ the [one] having received his - testimony has set his seal
50982 ^ that - god true is.
50987 ^ he whom for sent - god, the words - of god speaks,
50997 ^ not for by measure he gives the spirit.
51004 ^ the father loves the son,
51009 ^ and all things has given into the hand of him.
51016 ^ the [one] believing in the son has life eternal;
51024 ^ the [one] however not obeying the son, not will see life,
51032 ^ but the wrath - of god abides on him.”
51040 ^ when therefore knew - jesus
51045 ^ that heard the pharisees
51049 ^ that jesus more disciples makes
51054 ^ and baptizes
51056 ^ than john
51058 ^ although indeed jesus himself not was baptizing,
51063 ^ but the disciples of him
51067 ^ he left - judea,
51070 ^ and went away again into - galilee.
51076 ^ it was necessary for now
51078 ^ him to pass through - samaria.
51083 ^ he comes therefore to a city - of samaria
51089 ^ called sychar, near the plot of ground
51094 ^ that had given jacob to joseph, the son of him.
51102 ^ was now there [the] well - of jacob.
51108 ^ - therefore
51110 ^ jesus,
51111 ^ being wearied from the journey, was sitting thus at the well.
51120 ^ [the] hour was about [the] sixth.
51124 ^ comes a woman out of - samaria
51129 ^ to draw water.
51131 ^ says to her - jesus,
51135 ^ give me
51137 ^ to drink.
51138 ^ - for
51140 ^ the disciples of him had gone away into the city,
51146 ^ that food they might buy.
51149 ^ says therefore to him the woman - samaritan,
51156 ^ how you
51158 ^ a jew being, from me
51162 ^ to drink do ask,
51253 ^ everyone - drinking of the water this will thirst again;
51262 ^ whoever however - may drink of the water
51269 ^ that i will give him, never not will thirst, to the age.
51279 ^ instead, the water
51282 ^ that i will give to him will become in him a spring of water,
51290 ^ welling up into life eternal.
51294 ^ says to him the woman,
51299 ^ sir, give me this - water,
51305 ^ that not i might thirst,
51308 ^ nor come here
51311 ^ to draw.
51312 ^ he says to her,
51314 ^ go,
51315 ^ call the husband of you
51319 ^ and come here.
51322 ^ answered the woman
51325 ^ and said to him
51328 ^ not i have a husband.
51331 ^ says to her - jesus,
51335 ^ correctly you have spoken
51337 ^ -, a husband not i have.
51341 ^ five for
51343 ^ husbands you have had,
51345 ^ and now
51347 ^ he whom you have, not is your husband;
51353 ^ this truly you have spoken.
51356 ^ says to him the woman,
51360 ^ sir, i understand
51362 ^ that a prophet are you.
51366 ^ the fathers of us on the mountain this worshiped,
51374 ^ and you say
51377 ^ that in jerusalem is the place
51383 ^ where
51384 ^ to worship it is necessary.
51386 ^ says to her - jesus,
51390 ^ believe me, woman,
51393 ^ that is coming an hour
51396 ^ when neither on the mountain this, nor in jerusalem, will you worship the father.
51408 ^ you worship
51410 ^ what not you know;
51413 ^ we worship
51415 ^ what we know,
51417 ^ for - salvation of the jews is.
51424 ^ but is coming an hour
51427 ^ and now is,
51430 ^ when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and truth;
51441 ^ also for the father such seeks,
51454 ^ those worshiping him in spirit and truth it behooves
51462 ^ to worship.
51463 ^ says to him the woman,
51467 ^ i know
51468 ^ that messiah is coming,
51471 ^ who is called christ;
51474 ^ when comes he,
51477 ^ he will tell us all things.
51480 ^ says to her - jesus,
51484 ^ i am [he],
51486 ^ the [one] speaking to you.
51489 ^ and upon this came the disciples of him,
51496 ^ and were amazed
51498 ^ that with a woman he was speaking;
51502 ^ no one however said,
51505 ^ what seek you?
51507 ^ or why speak you with her?
51512 ^ left then the water pot of her the woman,
51519 ^ and went away into the city,
51524 ^ and says to the men,
51528 ^ come,
51529 ^ see a man
51531 ^ who told me all things
51535 ^ whatever i did.
51537 ^ can it be [that] this is the christ?
51542 ^ they went forth out of the city
51546 ^ and were coming unto him.
51550 ^ but in the meantime were asking him the disciples,
51557 ^ saying,
51558 ^ rabbi, eat.
51560 ^ - but he said to them,
51564 ^ i food have
51567 ^ to eat
52122 ^ the [one] having made me well,
52126 ^ that one to me said,
52129 ^ take up the mat of you
52133 ^ and walk.
52135 ^ they asked him,
52137 ^ who is the man
52141 ^ - having said to you,
52144 ^ take up
52145 ^ and walk?’
52147 ^ the [one] now having been healed not knew
52152 ^ who it is,
52154 ^ - for
52156 ^ jesus had moved away,
52158 ^ a crowd being in the place.
52163 ^ after these things finds him - jesus in the temple
52172 ^ and said to him,
52175 ^ behold,
52176 ^ well you have become;
52178 ^ no more sin,
52180 ^ that not worse to you
52184 ^ something happens.
52186 ^ went away the man
52189 ^ and told the jews
52193 ^ that jesus it is
52196 ^ the [one] having made him well.
52200 ^ and because of this, were persecuting the jews - jesus,
52208 ^ because these things he was doing on [the] sabbath.
52213 ^ - but
52215 ^ jesus answered them,
52218 ^ the father of me until now is working,
52224 ^ and i am working.
52226 ^ because of this therefore, the more were seeking
52231 ^ him the jews to kill,
52235 ^ because not only was he breaking the sabbath,
52241 ^ but also father his own he was calling - god,
52248 ^ equal himself making
52251 ^ to god.
52253 ^ answered therefore - jesus
52257 ^ and was saying to them,
52260 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
52264 ^ not is able the son
52268 ^ to do of himself nothing,
52272 ^ if not
52350 ^ he who not
52352 ^ is honoring the son, not is honoring the father,
52359 ^ the [one] having sent him.
52362 ^ truly, truly i say to you
52366 ^ that
52367 ^ the [one] the word of me
52371 ^ hearing,
52372 ^ and believing
52374 ^ the [one] having sent me, he has life eternal
52380 ^ and into judgment not comes,
52385 ^ but has passed out of - death into - life.
52393 ^ truly, truly, i say to you
52397 ^ that is coming an hour,
52400 ^ and now is,
52403 ^ when the dead will hear the voice of the son - of god,
52413 ^ and
52414 ^ those having heard will live.
52417 ^ as for the father has life in himself,
52425 ^ so also to the son he gave
52430 ^ life, to have in himself.
52434 ^ and authority he gave him
52470 ^ - and those evil having done, to [the] resurrection of judgment.
52478 ^ not am able i
52481 ^ to do of myself nothing;
52485 ^ as i hear,
52487 ^ i judge;
52488 ^ and the judgment - of me just is,
52495 ^ because not i seek the will - of me,
52502 ^ but the will
52505 ^ of the [one] having sent me.
52508 ^ if i bear witness concerning myself,
52513 ^ the testimony of me not is true.
52519 ^ another it is
52521 ^ - bearing witness concerning me,
52525 ^ and i know
52527 ^ that true is the testimony
52532 ^ which he bears witness concerning me.
52536 ^ you have sent unto john
52540 ^ and he has borne witness to the truth.
52544 ^ i now not from man the testimony receive,
52552 ^ but these things i say
52555 ^ that you may be saved.
52558 ^ he was the lamp
52562 ^ - burning
52564 ^ and shining;
52566 ^ you now were willing
52569 ^ to rejoice for a season in the light of him.
52576 ^ i however have the testimony greater than that of john.
52584 ^ - for
52586 ^ the works
52587 ^ that has given me the father
52592 ^ that i should complete them,
52595 ^ same the works
52598 ^ which i do, bear witness concerning me
52603 ^ that the father me has sent.
52608 ^ and the [one]
52610 ^ having sent me, [the] father
52613 ^ himself, has borne witness concerning me.
52617 ^ neither voice of him at any time have you heard,
52622 ^ nor form of him have you seen.
52626 ^ and the word of him not you have
52632 ^ in you abiding;
52635 ^ for whom sent he,
52639 ^ him you not believe.
52643 ^ you diligently search the scriptures,
52646 ^ for you think
52649 ^ in them life eternal to have;
52654 ^ and these are they
52657 ^ - bearing witness concerning me;
52661 ^ and not you are willing
52664 ^ to come to me
52667 ^ that life you may have.
52670 ^ glory from men not i take;
52675 ^ but i have known you,
52678 ^ that the love - of god not you have in yourselves.
52687 ^ i have come in the name of the father of me,
52695 ^ and not you receive me;
52699 ^ if another should come in the name the own,
52707 ^ him you will receive.
52709 ^ how are able you
52712 ^ to believe,
52713 ^ glory from one another receiving,
52717 ^ and the glory that [is] from the only god, not you seek?
52727 ^ not think
52729 ^ that i will accuse you to the father.
52736 ^ there is
52737 ^ [one] accusing you, moses,
52741 ^ in whom you have hoped.
52745 ^ if for you were believing moses,
52749 ^ you would have believed - me;
52752 ^ concerning for
52754 ^ me he wrote.
52757 ^ if now - his writings not you believe,
52764 ^ how - my words will you believe?
52769 ^ after these things went away - jesus over the sea - of galilee — - of tiberias.
52781 ^ was following now him a crowd great,
52786 ^ because they were seeing the signs
52790 ^ which he was doing
52792 ^ upon those being sick.
52795 ^ went up now on the mountain jesus,
52801 ^ and there he was sitting with the disciples of him.
52808 ^ was now near the passover, the feast of the jews.
52817 ^ having lifted up then
52819 ^ the eyes - jesus
52823 ^ and having seen
52825 ^ that a great crowd is coming to him, he says to philip,
52834 ^ from where shall we buy bread
52837 ^ that might eat these?
52840 ^ this now he was saying
52843 ^ testing him;
52845 ^ he for knew
53366 ^ the [one] coming to me never not shall hunger,
53373 ^ and
53374 ^ the [one] believing in me no not shall thirst at any time.
53382 ^ but i said to you
53385 ^ that also you have seen me,
53389 ^ and yet not believe.
53392 ^ all
53393 ^ that gives me the father, to me will come,
53401 ^ and
53402 ^ the [one] coming to me, no not shall i cast out.
53410 ^ for i have come down from - heaven,
53415 ^ not that i should do the will - of me,
53422 ^ but the will
53425 ^ of the [one] having sent me.
53428 ^ this now is the will
53433 ^ of the [one] having sent me,
53436 ^ that all
53438 ^ that he has given me,
53441 ^ none i should lose of it,
53445 ^ but will raise up it in the last day.
53452 ^ this for is the will of the father of me,
53460 ^ that
53461 ^ everyone - beholding the son
53466 ^ and believing in him should have life eternal,
53473 ^ and will raise up him i in the last day.
53481 ^ were grumbling therefore the jews about him
53487 ^ because he said,
53489 ^ i am the bread
53493 ^ - having come down from - heaven.
53498 ^ and they were saying,
53500 ^ not this is jesus the son of joseph,
53507 ^ of whom we know
53510 ^ the father and the mother?
53515 ^ how then says he
53518 ^ -, from - heaven i have come down?
53523 ^ answered jesus
53525 ^ and said to them,
53528 ^ not grumble with one another.
53532 ^ no one is able
53534 ^ to come to me,
53537 ^ if not the father,
53541 ^ the [one] having sent me, draws him,
53546 ^ and i will raise up him in the last day.
53553 ^ it is
53554 ^ written in the prophets:
53558 ^ and they will be all taught of god.’
53563 ^ everyone - having heard from the father
53569 ^ and having learned, comes to me.
53574 ^ not that the father has seen anyone,
53580 ^ if not
53582 ^ the [one] being from - god;
53587 ^ he has seen the father.
53591 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
53595 ^ the [one] believing has life eternal.
53600 ^ i am the bread - of life.
53606 ^ the fathers of you ate in the wilderness the manna,
53615 ^ and died.
53617 ^ this is the bread
53621 ^ - from - heaven
53625 ^ coming down,
53626 ^ that anyone of it may eat,
53631 ^ and not die.
53634 ^ i am the bread
53638 ^ - living,
53640 ^ - from - heaven
53644 ^ having come down;
53645 ^ if anyone shall have eaten of this - bread,
53652 ^ he will live to the age;
53656 ^ and the bread also
53799 ^ the [one] eating this - bread will live to the age.
53808 ^ these things he said
53810 ^ in [the] synagogue, teaching in capernaum.
53815 ^ many therefore,
53817 ^ having heard,
53818 ^ of the disciples of him, said,
53823 ^ difficult is the word this;
53828 ^ who is able
53830 ^ it to hear?
53832 ^ knowing however - jesus
53836 ^ in himself
53838 ^ that are grumbling about this the disciples of him, he said to them,
53847 ^ this you does offend?
53850 ^ what if then you should see the son - of man
53857 ^ ascending
53858 ^ where he was - before?
53862 ^ the spirit it is
53865 ^ - giving life;
53867 ^ the flesh not profits nothing.
53872 ^ the words
53874 ^ that i speak to you spirit are,
53880 ^ and life they are.
53883 ^ but they are of you some
53888 ^ who not believe.
53891 ^ knew for from [the] beginning - jesus
53897 ^ who are
53899 ^ those not
53901 ^ believing
53902 ^ and who it is
53905 ^ who will betray him.
53908 ^ and he was saying,
53910 ^ because of this have i said to you
53914 ^ that no one is able
53917 ^ to come to me,
53920 ^ if not it shall
53923 ^ have been granted to him from the father.
53928 ^ from that [time], many out of the disciples of him departed to the back
53939 ^ and no longer with him walked.
53944 ^ said therefore - jesus to the twelve,
53950 ^ not also you are wishing
53954 ^ to go away?
53955 ^ answered him simon peter,
53959 ^ lord, to whom will we go?
53963 ^ [the] words of life eternal you have;
53967 ^ and we have believed
53970 ^ and have known
53972 ^ that you are the holy one - of god.
53979 ^ answered them - jesus,
53983 ^ not i you the twelve did choose,
53989 ^ and of you one a devil is?
53995 ^ he was speaking now - of judas [son] of simon iscariot;
54001 ^ he for was about
54004 ^ to betray him,
54006 ^ one of the twelve.
54010 ^ and after these things, was walking - jesus in - galilee;
54019 ^ not for he did desire
54022 ^ in - judea to walk,
54026 ^ because were seeking
54028 ^ him the jews to kill.
54032 ^ was now near the feast of the jews, of booths.
54041 ^ said therefore to him the brothers of him,
54048 ^ depart from here
54050 ^ and go into - judea,
54055 ^ so that also the disciples of you will see of you the works
54064 ^ that you are doing.
54066 ^ no one for anything in secret does
54072 ^ and seeks himself
54075 ^ in public to be.
54078 ^ if these things you do,
54081 ^ show yourself to the world.
54085 ^ not even for the brothers of him were believing in him.
54093 ^ says therefore to them - jesus,
54098 ^ the time - of me not yet is come,
54104 ^ - but
54106 ^ the time - of you always is ready.
54112 ^ not is able the world
54116 ^ to hate you;
54118 ^ me however it hates,
54121 ^ because i bear witness concerning it
54126 ^ that the works of it evil are.
54132 ^ you go up to the feast.
54137 ^ i not am going up to the feast this,
54144 ^ for - my time not yet has been fulfilled.
54285 ^ the [one] from himself
54288 ^ speaking, the glory the own seeks;
54294 ^ the [one] however seeking the glory
54299 ^ of the [one] having sent him,
54302 ^ he true is,
54305 ^ and unrighteousness in him not is.
54311 ^ not moses has given to you the law,
54317 ^ and no one of you keeps the law?
54324 ^ why
54325 ^ me do you seek to kill?
54328 ^ answered the crowd,
54331 ^ a demon you have;
54333 ^ who
54334 ^ you seeks to kill?
54337 ^ answered jesus
54339 ^ and said to them,
54342 ^ one work i did,
54345 ^ and all you marvel.
54348 ^ because of the fact that moses has given you - circumcision —
54355 ^ not that of - moses it is,
54361 ^ but of the fathers —
54365 ^ also on sabbath you circumcise a man.
54370 ^ if circumcision receives a man on sabbath
54376 ^ so that not might be broken the law of moses,
54382 ^ with me are you angry
54384 ^ because entirely a man sound i made on the sabbath?
54391 ^ not judge according to appearance,
54395 ^ but the righteous judgment judge.
54400 ^ were saying therefore some of those of jerusalem,
54406 ^ not this is he
54644 ^ the [one] believing in me,
54648 ^ as has said the scripture:
54652 ^ rivers out of the belly of him will flow
54658 ^ of water
54659 ^ living.
54660 ^ this now he said concerning the spirit,
54980 ^ - and having heard, they began to go away one by one
54987 ^ having begun from the elder ones,
54991 ^ and he was left alone,
54994 ^ and the woman
54997 ^ in [the] midst being.
55045 ^ the [one] following me no not shall walk in the darkness,
55054 ^ but will have the light - of life.
55060 ^ said therefore to him the pharisees,
55065 ^ you concerning yourself are bearing witness;
55069 ^ the testimony of you not is true.
55075 ^ answered jesus
55077 ^ and said to them,
55080 ^ even if i am bearing witness concerning myself,
55085 ^ true is the testimony of me,
55090 ^ because i know
55092 ^ from where i came
55094 ^ and where i am going.
55097 ^ you however not know
55101 ^ from where i come
55103 ^ or where i am going.
55106 ^ you according to the flesh judge;
55111 ^ i not am judging no one.
55115 ^ and if judge however i,
55120 ^ - judgment - my true is,
55126 ^ because alone not i am,
55130 ^ but i and the
55134 ^ having sent me father.
55137 ^ and in the law also
55142 ^ - of you it has been written
55145 ^ that of two men the testimony true is.
55152 ^ i am
55154 ^ the [one] bearing witness concerning myself,
55158 ^ and bears witness concerning me the
55163 ^ having sent me father.
55166 ^ they were saying therefore to him,
55169 ^ where is the father of you?
55174 ^ answered jesus,
55176 ^ neither me you know,
55179 ^ nor the father of me.
55183 ^ if me you had known,
55186 ^ also the father of me - you would have known.
55192 ^ these - words he spoke in the treasury,
55199 ^ teaching in the temple;
55203 ^ and no one seized him,
55207 ^ for not yet had come the hour of him.
55213 ^ he said then again to them,
55217 ^ i am going away
55219 ^ and you will seek me,
55222 ^ and in the sin of you, you will die;
55228 ^ where i go,
55231 ^ you not are able
55234 ^ to come.
55235 ^ were saying therefore the jews,
55239 ^ not will he kill himself,
55242 ^ that he says,
55244 ^ where i go,
55247 ^ you not are able
55250 ^ to come’?
55251 ^ and he was saying to them,
55254 ^ you from - below are;
55259 ^ i from - above am.
55264 ^ you of this the world are,
55270 ^ i not am of the world this.
55277 ^ i said therefore to you
55280 ^ that you will die in the sins of you;
55286 ^ if for not you believe
55290 ^ that i am [he],
55293 ^ you will die in the sins of you.
55298 ^ they were saying therefore to him,
55301 ^ you who are?
55304 ^ said to them - jesus,
55308 ^ from the beginning what also i am saying to you.
55314 ^ many things i have
55316 ^ concerning you to say,
55319 ^ and to judge;
55321 ^ but
55322 ^ the [one] having sent me true is;
55327 ^ and i
55328 ^ what i have heard from him,
55332 ^ these things i say to the world.
55337 ^ not they understood
55339 ^ that [about] the father to them he was speaking.
55344 ^ said therefore to them - jesus,
55349 ^ when you shall have lifted up the son - of man,
55355 ^ then you will know
55357 ^ that i am [he],
55360 ^ and from myself i do nothing,
55365 ^ but as taught me the father,
55371 ^ these things i speak.
55373 ^ and
55374 ^ the [one] having sent me, with me is;
55380 ^ not he has left me alone,
55384 ^ because i the things pleasing to him do always.
55391 ^ these things of his speaking,
55394 ^ many believed in him.
55398 ^ was saying therefore - jesus to the
55404 ^ having believed in him jews,
55407 ^ if you abide in the word - my,
55415 ^ truly disciples of me you are.
55419 ^ and you will know the truth,
55423 ^ and the truth will set free you.
55428 ^ they answered unto him,
55431 ^ seed of abraham we are,
55434 ^ and to no one have we been under bondage ever.
55438 ^ how you say
55441 ^ -, free you will become’?
55444 ^ answered them - jesus,
55448 ^ truly, truly, i say to you
55452 ^ that
55453 ^ everyone - practicing the sin, a slave is
55460 ^ of the sin.
55462 ^ - now
55464 ^ the slave not abides in the house to the age;
55473 ^ the son abides to the age.
55479 ^ if therefore the son you shall set free,
55485 ^ indeed free you will be.
55488 ^ i know
55489 ^ that seed of abraham you are;
55493 ^ but you seek
55495 ^ me to kill,
55497 ^ because the word - of me not receives a place in you.
55703 ^ he who is of - god, the words - of god hears;
55713 ^ because of this you not hear,
55718 ^ because of - god, not you are.
55724 ^ answered the jews
55727 ^ and said to him,
55730 ^ not rightly say we
55734 ^ that a samaritan are you,
55738 ^ and a demon have?
55741 ^ answered jesus,
55743 ^ i a demon not have;
55747 ^ but i honor the father of me,
55752 ^ and you dishonor me.
55756 ^ i now not seek the glory of me;
55763 ^ there is
55764 ^ one seeking [it]
55766 ^ and judging.
55768 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
55772 ^ if anyone - my word keeps,
55778 ^ death never not shall he see, to the age.
55785 ^ said therefore to him the jews,
55790 ^ now we know
55792 ^ that a demon you have.
55795 ^ abraham died,
55797 ^ and the prophets,
55800 ^ and you say,
55803 ^ if anyone the word of me keeps,
55809 ^ never not shall he taste of death, to the age.
55816 ^ not you greater than are
55820 ^ the father of us abraham,
55824 ^ who died?
55826 ^ and the prophets died!
55830 ^ whom yourself make you?
55833 ^ answered jesus,
55835 ^ if i glorify myself,
55839 ^ the glory of me nothing is;
55844 ^ it is the father of me
55848 ^ - glorifying me,
55851 ^ [of] whom you say
55854 ^ -, god of us he is.
55858 ^ and not you have known him,
55862 ^ i however know him.
55866 ^ and if i say
55868 ^ that not i know him,
55872 ^ i will be like you, a liar.
55876 ^ but i know him,
55879 ^ and the word of him i keep.
55884 ^ abraham the father of you rejoiced
55889 ^ in that he should see - day - my,
55895 ^ and he saw
55897 ^ and rejoiced.
55899 ^ said therefore the jews to him,
55905 ^ fifty years [old] not yet are you,
55909 ^ and abraham you have seen?
55912 ^ said to them jesus,
55915 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
55919 ^ before abraham was,
55922 ^ i am.
55924 ^ they took up therefore stones,
55927 ^ that they might cast at him;
55931 ^ jesus however hid himself,
55934 ^ and went forth out of the temple.
55939 ^ and
55940 ^ passing by, he saw a man blind from birth.
55946 ^ and asked him the disciples of him
55952 ^ saying,
55953 ^ rabbi, who sinned,
55956 ^ this [man] or the parents of him,
55961 ^ that blind he should be born?
55964 ^ answered jesus,
55966 ^ neither this [man] sinned,
55969 ^ nor the parents of him;
55973 ^ but [it was] that should be displayed the works - of god in him.
55982 ^ us it behooves to work the works
55987 ^ of the [one] having sent me,
55990 ^ while day it is;
55993 ^ is coming night,
55995 ^ when no one is able
55998 ^ to work.
55999 ^ while in the world i shall be,
56004 ^ [the] light i am
56006 ^ of the world.
56654 ^ the [one] however entering in by the door, shepherd is
56662 ^ of the sheep.
56664 ^ to him the doorkeeper opens,
56668 ^ and the sheep the voice of him hear,
56675 ^ and the own sheep he calls by name
56682 ^ and leads out them.
56685 ^ when the own all he has brought out,
56690 ^ before them he goes,
56693 ^ and the sheep him follow,
56698 ^ because they know the voice of him.
56703 ^ a stranger however in no way not they will follow,
56708 ^ but will flee from him,
56712 ^ because not they recognize - of strangers the voice.
56719 ^ this - allegory spoke to them - jesus;
56726 ^ they however not knew
56730 ^ what it was
56732 ^ that he was saying to them.
56735 ^ said therefore again - jesus,
56740 ^ truly, truly, i say to you
56744 ^ -, i am the door of the sheep.
56751 ^ all
56752 ^ who ever came before me, thieves are
56758 ^ and robbers;
56760 ^ but not did hear them the sheep.
56766 ^ i am the door;
56770 ^ by me if anyone enters in,
56775 ^ he will be saved,
56776 ^ and he will go in
56778 ^ and will go out,
56780 ^ and pasture will find.
56783 ^ the thief not comes
56787 ^ if not that he might steal,
56791 ^ and might kill,
56793 ^ and might destroy.
56795 ^ i came
56797 ^ that life they may have,
56800 ^ and abundantly may have [it].
56803 ^ i am the shepherd - good.
56809 ^ the shepherd - good, the life of him lays down for the sheep;
56820 ^ the hired servant
56822 ^ however not being [the] shepherd,
56902 ^ those also it behooves me to bring,
56906 ^ and the voice of me they will hear;
56911 ^ and there will be one flock, with one shepherd.
56917 ^ because of this, me the father loves,
56923 ^ because i lay down the life of me,
56929 ^ that again i might take it.
56933 ^ no one takes it from me,
56938 ^ but i lay down it of myself.
56944 ^ authority i have
57329 ^ ailing,
57330 ^ lazarus of bethany, of the village of mary and martha, the sister of her.
57342 ^ was now mary
57345 ^ the [one] having anointed the lord with fragrant oil
57350 ^ and having wiped the feet of him with the hair of her,
57358 ^ whose - brother lazarus was sick.
57363 ^ sent therefore the sisters to him,
57369 ^ saying,
57370 ^ lord, behold,
57372 ^ [he] whom you love is sick.
57695 ^ the [one] believing in me,
57699 ^ even if he should die,
57701 ^ he will live;
57702 ^ and
57703 ^ everyone - living
57706 ^ and believing in me, never not shall die, to the age.
57716 ^ believe you this?
57718 ^ she says to him,
57720 ^ yes, lord;
57722 ^ i have believed
57724 ^ that you are the christ, the son - of god,
57733 ^ the [one] into the world
57737 ^ coming.
57738 ^ and
57739 ^ these things having said, she went away
57742 ^ and called mary, the sister of her,
57748 ^ secretly, having said,
57750 ^ the teacher is come,
57753 ^ and he calls you.
57756 ^ she then
57758 ^ when she heard,
57760 ^ rose up quickly
57762 ^ and was coming to him.
57766 ^ not yet now had come - jesus into the village,
57774 ^ but was still in the place
57780 ^ where had met him - martha.
57785 ^ the then
57787 ^ jews
57788 ^ - being with her in the house
57795 ^ and consoling her,
57798 ^ having seen - mary
57801 ^ that quickly she rose up
57804 ^ and went out, followed her,
57808 ^ having supposed
57809 ^ - she is going to the tomb
57814 ^ that she might weep there.
57817 ^ - therefore
57819 ^ mary,
57820 ^ when she came
57822 ^ to where was jesus,
58687 ^ the [one] loving the life of him, loses it,
58694 ^ and
58695 ^ the [one] hating the life of him in the world this, to life eternal will keep it.
58709 ^ if me anyone serves,
58713 ^ me let him follow;
58715 ^ and where am i,
58719 ^ there also the servant - of me will be.
58726 ^ if anyone me serves,
58730 ^ will honor him the father.
58734 ^ now the soul of me has been troubled,
58739 ^ and what shall i say?
58742 ^ father, save me from the hour this.’
58749 ^ but on account of this i came to the hour this.
58757 ^ father, glorify of you the name.
58762 ^ came therefore a voice from - heaven:
58768 ^ both i have glorified [it],
58770 ^ and again i will glorify [it].
58773 ^ - therefore
58775 ^ the crowd
58776 ^ - having stood
58778 ^ and having heard was saying,
58781 ^ thunder there has been.
58783 ^ others were saying,
58785 ^ an angel to him has spoken.
58788 ^ answered jesus
58790 ^ and said
58792 ^ not because of me the voice this has come,
58799 ^ but because of you.
58802 ^ now [the] judgment is
58805 ^ the world of this;
58808 ^ now the prince of the world this will be cast out.
58816 ^ and i,
58817 ^ if i am lifted up from the earth,
58822 ^ all will draw to myself.
58826 ^ this now he was saying,
58829 ^ signifying
59035 ^ the [one] believing in me, not believes in me,
59043 ^ but
59044 ^ in the [one] having sent me;
59048 ^ and
59049 ^ the [one] beholding me, beholds
59053 ^ the [one] having sent me.
59056 ^ i a light into the world have come,
59062 ^ so that
59063 ^ everyone - believing in me, in the darkness not should abide.
59073 ^ and if anyone of me hears
59078 ^ the words
59080 ^ and not keeps [them],
59083 ^ i not do judge him,
59087 ^ not for i came
59090 ^ that i might judge the world,
59094 ^ but that i might save the world.
59099 ^ the [one] rejecting me
59102 ^ and not receiving the words of me has
59109 ^ [one] judging him:
59112 ^ the word
59114 ^ which i spoke,
59116 ^ that will judge him in the last day.
59123 ^ for i from myself not spoke,
59129 ^ but the
59131 ^ having sent me father himself, me a commandment gave
59138 ^ what i should say
59140 ^ and what i should speak.
59143 ^ and i know
59145 ^ that the commandment of him life eternal is.
59152 ^ what therefore i speak,
59156 ^ as has said to me the father,
59161 ^ so i speak.
59163 ^ before now
59165 ^ the feast of the passover,
59169 ^ knowing - jesus
59172 ^ that had come his - hour,
59177 ^ that he would depart out of the world this to the father,
59186 ^ having loved the own who [were] in the world, to [the] end he loved them.
59197 ^ and supper taking place,
59200 ^ the devil already having put into the heart
59207 ^ that he should betray him of judas, [son] of simon iscariot,
59213 ^ knowing
59214 ^ that all things has given him the father into the hands,
59223 ^ and that from god he came forth
59228 ^ and to - god he is going, he rises from the supper
59237 ^ and lays aside the garments.
59241 ^ and
59242 ^ having taken a towel, he girded himself.
59246 ^ after that, he pours water into the basin,
59252 ^ and he began
59254 ^ to wash the feet of the disciples,
59259 ^ and to wipe [them] with the towel
59263 ^ with which he was
59265 ^ girded.
59266 ^ he comes then to simon peter,
59271 ^ who says to him,
59273 ^ lord, you of me do wash
59277 ^ the feet?
59279 ^ answered jesus
59281 ^ and said to him,
59340 ^ the [one] having been bathed not has need,
59345 ^ if not
59347 ^ the feet to wash,
59350 ^ but is clean wholly;
59354 ^ and you all clean are,
59358 ^ but not all.
59361 ^ he knew for
59363 ^ the [one who] was betraying him;
59366 ^ on account of this he said
59369 ^ -, not all clean you are.
59374 ^ when therefore he had washed the feet of them
59380 ^ and taken the garments of him,
59385 ^ and having reclined again,
59388 ^ he said to them,
59390 ^ do you know
59391 ^ what i have done to you?
59394 ^ you call me
59397 ^ - teacher and - lord,
59402 ^ and rightly you say,
59405 ^ i am for.
59407 ^ if therefore i have washed your - feet,
59414 ^ the lord and the teacher,
59419 ^ also you ought
59422 ^ of one another to wash
59424 ^ the feet.
59426 ^ a pattern for i gave you,
59430 ^ that as i did to you,
59435 ^ also you should do.
59438 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
59442 ^ not is a servant greater than the master of him,
59449 ^ nor a messenger greater than
59452 ^ the [one] having sent him.
59455 ^ if these things you know,
59458 ^ blessed are you
59460 ^ if you do them.
59463 ^ not about all of you i speak.
59468 ^ i know
59470 ^ whom i chose,
59472 ^ but that the scripture may be fulfilled:
59477 ^ the [one] eating of me the bread lifted up against me the heel of him.’
59488 ^ from this time i am telling you
59492 ^ before - it comes to pass,
59495 ^ so that you should believe
59497 ^ when it comes to pass,
59499 ^ that i am [he].
59502 ^ truly, truly, i say to you,
59506 ^ the [one] receiving
59508 ^ - any i shall send, me receives;
59513 ^ the [one] now me receiving, receives
59518 ^ the [one] having sent me.
60034 ^ the [one] believing in me,
60038 ^ the works
60040 ^ that i do, also he will do,
60045 ^ and greater than these he will do,
60049 ^ because i to the father am going.
60055 ^ and whatever - you might ask in the name of me,
60063 ^ this will i do,
60065 ^ so that may be glorified the father in the son.
60072 ^ if anything you ask me in the name of me,
60080 ^ i will do [it].
60082 ^ if you love me,
60085 ^ - commandments - my you will keep.
60090 ^ and i will ask the father,
60094 ^ and another helper he will give you,
60099 ^ that with you to the age, he may be the spirit - of truth,
60190 ^ the [one] now loving me, will be loved by the father of me;
60199 ^ and i will love him
60202 ^ and will show to him myself.
60206 ^ says to him judas, not - iscariot,
60212 ^ lord, then what has occurred
60216 ^ that
60217 ^ to us you are about to manifest yourself,
60221 ^ and not to the world?
60225 ^ answered jesus
60227 ^ and said to him,
60230 ^ if anyone loves me,
60234 ^ the word of me he will keep,
60238 ^ and the father of me will love him,
60244 ^ and to him we will come,
60248 ^ and a home with him will make.
60253 ^ the [one] not
60255 ^ loving me, the words of me not does keep;
60262 ^ and the word
60265 ^ that you hear, not is mine,
60270 ^ but of the
60272 ^ having sent me father.
60275 ^ these things i have said to you,
60278 ^ with you abiding.
60281 ^ the however
60283 ^ helper, the spirit - holy,
60288 ^ whom will send the father in the name of me,
60296 ^ he you will teach all things
60300 ^ and will bring to remembrance of you all things
60304 ^ that have said to you
60307 ^ i. peace i leave with you;
60311 ^ peace - my i give to you;
60316 ^ not as the world gives,
60321 ^ i give to you.
60324 ^ not let be troubled of you the heart,
60329 ^ nor let it fear.
60331 ^ you heard
60332 ^ that i said to you,
60336 ^ i am going away
60337 ^ and i am coming to you.
60341 ^ if you loved me,
60344 ^ you would have rejoiced -
60346 ^ that i am going to the father,
60351 ^ because the father greater than i is.
60357 ^ and now i have told you
60361 ^ before it comes to pass,
60363 ^ that when it shall have come to pass,
60366 ^ you might believe.
60367 ^ no longer much i will speak with you;
60372 ^ comes for the of this world ruler,
60378 ^ and in me not he has nothing;
60384 ^ but that may know the world
60389 ^ that i love the father,
60393 ^ and as has commanded me the father,
60399 ^ thus i do.
60401 ^ rise up,
60402 ^ let us go from here.
60404 ^ i am the vine - true,
60410 ^ and the father of me, the vinedresser is.
60417 ^ every branch in me
60421 ^ not bearing fruit,
60424 ^ he takes away it;
60426 ^ and
60427 ^ every one - fruit
60430 ^ bearing,
60431 ^ he prunes it,
60433 ^ that fruit more it may bear.
60437 ^ already you clean are by reason of the word
60444 ^ that i have spoken to you.
60447 ^ abide in me,
60450 ^ and i in you.
60453 ^ as the branch not is able
60458 ^ fruit to bear of itself,
60462 ^ if not it abide in the vine,
60468 ^ so neither [can] you,
60471 ^ if not in me you abide.
60476 ^ i am the vine;
60480 ^ you [are] the branches.
60483 ^ the [one] abiding in me,
60487 ^ and i in him,
60490 ^ he bears fruit much.
60494 ^ for apart from me not you are able
60499 ^ to do nothing.
60501 ^ if not anyone abide in me,
60507 ^ he is thrown out
60509 ^ like the branch
60512 ^ and is dried up,
60514 ^ and they gather them
60517 ^ and into the fire cast,
60522 ^ and it is burned.
60524 ^ if you abide in me
60528 ^ and the words of me in you abide,
60820 ^ the [one] me
60822 ^ hating, also the father of me hates.
60828 ^ if the works not i had done among them
62705 ^ everyone - being of the truth hears of me the voice.
62715 ^ says to him - pilate,
62719 ^ what is truth?
62722 ^ and
62723 ^ this having said, again he went out to the jews
62730 ^ and says to them,
62733 ^ i no find in him
62738 ^ guilt.
62739 ^ it is however a custom with you
62743 ^ that one i should release to you at the passover;
62750 ^ wish you therefore
62752 ^ i should release to you the king of the jews?
62758 ^ they cried out then again
62761 ^ saying,
62762 ^ not this one,
62764 ^ but - barabbas!
62767 ^ was now - barabbas an insurrectionist.
62772 ^ at that time therefore took - pilate - jesus
62779 ^ and flogged [him].
62781 ^ and the soldiers,
62784 ^ having twisted together a crown of thorns, put [it] on of him the head,
62792 ^ and a robe purple cast around him,
62797 ^ and they began coming up to him
62801 ^ and saying,
62803 ^ hail, - king of the jews!
62808 ^ and they kept giving him blows with the palm.
62812 ^ and went forth again outside - pilate,
62818 ^ and he says to them,
62821 ^ behold,
62822 ^ i bring to you him out,
62826 ^ so that you may know
62828 ^ that no guilt i find in him.
62834 ^ went forth therefore - jesus outside,
62839 ^ wearing the thorny crown and the purple robe.
62847 ^ and he says to them,
62850 ^ behold
62851 ^ the man!
62853 ^ when therefore saw him the chief priests and the officers,
62862 ^ they cried out
62863 ^ saying,
62864 ^ crucify!
62865 ^ crucify!
62866 ^ says to them - pilate,
62870 ^ take him yourselves
62873 ^ and crucify [him];
62875 ^ i for no find in him guilt.
62882 ^ answered him the jews,
62886 ^ we a law have,
62889 ^ and according to the law, he ought
62894 ^ to die,
62895 ^ because [the] son of god himself he made.
62900 ^ when therefore heard - pilate this - word,
62908 ^ [the] more he was afraid.
62910 ^ and he went into the praetorium again,
62916 ^ and he says - to jesus,
62920 ^ from where are you?
62923 ^ - but
62925 ^ jesus an answer not did give him.
62930 ^ says therefore to him - pilate,
62935 ^ to me not speak you?
62938 ^ not know you
62940 ^ that authority i have
62994 ^ everyone - a king himself
62998 ^ making, speaks against - caesar.
63002 ^ - therefore
63004 ^ pilate,
63005 ^ having heard the words these, brought out - jesus,
63013 ^ and sat down upon [the] judgment seat at a place
63019 ^ called [the] stone pavement;
63021 ^ in hebrew now, gabbatha.
63024 ^ it was now the day of preparation of the passover;
63029 ^ [the] hour was about the sixth.
63033 ^ and he says to the jews,
63037 ^ behold
63038 ^ the king of you!
63041 ^ they cried out therefore, with him
63044 ^ away,
63045 ^ away!
63046 ^ crucify him!
63048 ^ says to them - pilate,
63052 ^ the king of you shall i crucify?
63056 ^ answered the chief priests,
63059 ^ not we have a king,
63062 ^ if not caesar.
63065 ^ then therefore he delivered him to them,
63070 ^ that he might be crucified.
63072 ^ they took therefore - jesus.
63076 ^ and
63077 ^ bearing [his] own - cross, he went out
63082 ^ to the called of the skull place,
63087 ^ which is called in hebrew golgotha,
63091 ^ where him they crucified,
63094 ^ and with him others two, on this side and on that side,
63102 ^ in between now - jesus.
63106 ^ wrote then also a title - pilate
63112 ^ and put [it] on the cross.
63117 ^ it was now
63119 ^ written:
63120 ^ jesus of nazareth, the king of the jews.
63127 ^ this therefore
63129 ^ the title many read
63133 ^ of the jews,
63135 ^ for near was the place,
63140 ^ the city,
63142 ^ where was crucified - jesus,
63146 ^ and it was
63148 ^ written in hebrew, in latin, in greek.
63152 ^ were saying therefore - to pilate the chief priests of the jews,
63160 ^ not write,
63162 ^ the king of the jews,
63166 ^ but that he said,
63170 ^ king i am
63172 ^ of the jews.
63174 ^ answered - pilate,
66016 ^ many and both
66018 ^ wonders and signs through the apostles were taking place.
66025 ^ all now - having believed were together the same
66033 ^ and having all things in common;
66037 ^ and the possessions and the goods they were selling
66044 ^ and were dividing them to all,
66048 ^ as - anyone need had.
66053 ^ every day and
66056 ^ steadfastly continuing with one accord in the temple,
66061 ^ breaking then at each house bread, they were partaking of food with gladness and sincerity of heart,
66073 ^ praising - god
66076 ^ and having favor with all the people.
66083 ^ - and
66085 ^ the lord kept adding
66087 ^ those who were being saved every day to their number.
66094 ^ peter now
66096 ^ and john were going up into the temple at the hour - of prayer, the ninth.
66109 ^ and a certain man,
66112 ^ lame from womb of mother of him being, was being carried,
66119 ^ whom they placed every day at the gate of the temple
66128 ^ - called beautiful
66131 ^ - to ask for alms
66134 ^ from those who were going into the temple,
66140 ^ who
66141 ^ having seen peter and john
66145 ^ being about
66146 ^ to enter into the temple, was asking
66151 ^ alms to receive.
66467 ^ whom it behooves heaven indeed to receive, until [the] times of restoration of all things,
66476 ^ of which spoke - god by [the] mouth of holy from [the] age his prophets.
66488 ^ moses indeed said
66491 ^ -, a prophet to you will raise up [the] lord the god of you out from the brothers of you, like me;
66505 ^ him you will listen to in all things,
66509 ^ as many as - he might say to you.
66514 ^ it will be [that] now
66516 ^ every soul
66518 ^ who, if not might heed the prophet that, will be utterly destroyed out from the people.’
66529 ^ and all now
66532 ^ the prophets from samuel, and those subsequently,
66539 ^ as many as have spoken, also have announced the days these.
66546 ^ you are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant
66555 ^ that made - god with the fathers of you,
66563 ^ saying to abraham,
66566 ^ and in the seed of you will be blessed all the families of the earth.’
66577 ^ to you first,
66579 ^ having raised up - god the servant of him, sent him,
66587 ^ blessing you
66589 ^ in - turning away each from the wickednesses of you.
66597 ^ speaking now of them to the people,
66603 ^ came upon them the priests and the captain of the temple and the sadducees,
66615 ^ being distressed
66616 ^ because of - teaching their the people
66622 ^ and proclaiming in - jesus the resurrection - out from [the] dead;
66632 ^ and they laid on them the hands
66637 ^ and put [them] in custody until the next day;
66644 ^ it was for evening already.
66648 ^ many however
67225 ^ as many as for owners of lands or houses were
67232 ^ selling [them], were bringing the proceeds
67236 ^ of what is sold,
67238 ^ and were laying [them] at the feet of the apostles;
67245 ^ distribution was made then to each
67248 ^ just as - anyone need had.
67253 ^ joseph now
67255 ^ - having been called barnabas by the apostles
67815 ^ to obey it is necessary god, rather than men.
67821 ^ the god of the fathers of us raised up jesus,
67828 ^ whom you killed,
67831 ^ having hanged [him] on a tree.
67834 ^ him - god [as] prince and savior exalted by the right hand of him,
67844 ^ - to give repentance - to israel
67849 ^ and forgiveness of sins.
67852 ^ and we are witnesses of the things these,
67859 ^ and also the spirit - holy,
67864 ^ whom has given - god
67868 ^ to those obeying him.
67871 ^ - and
67873 ^ having heard, they were cut [to the heart]
67875 ^ and were desiring
67877 ^ to put to death them.
68825 ^ the [one] however mistreating the neighbor pushed away him,
68832 ^ having said,
68833 ^ who you appointed, ruler and judge over us?
68841 ^ not
68842 ^ to kill me you desire,
68846 ^ the same way you put to death yesterday the egyptian?’
68852 ^ fled then moses at the remark this,
68859 ^ and became exiled in [the] land of midian,
68865 ^ where he begat sons two.
68869 ^ and having been passed years forty,
68873 ^ appeared to him in the wilderness of the mount sinai an angel in a flame of fire of a bush.
68886 ^ - and
68888 ^ moses
68889 ^ having seen [it], marveled at the vision;
68893 ^ coming near then of him
68896 ^ to behold [it],
68897 ^ there was [the] voice of [the] lord:
68900 ^ i [am] the god of the fathers of you, the god of abraham, and of isaac, and of jacob.’
70246 ^ that what you it behooves to do.
70251 ^ - and
70253 ^ the men
70254 ^ - traveling with him stood speechless,
70259 ^ hearing indeed the voice,
70263 ^ no one however seeing.
70266 ^ rose up then saul from the ground;
70272 ^ having been opened however the eyes of him,
70277 ^ nothing he could see.
70421 ^ how much it behooves him for the name of me to suffer.
70429 ^ went away then ananias
70432 ^ and entered into the house;
70437 ^ and
70438 ^ having laid upon him the hands, he said,
70444 ^ saul brother, the lord has sent me,
70450 ^ jesus,
70451 ^ the [one] having appeared to you on the road
70457 ^ by which you were coming,
70459 ^ that you may see again
70461 ^ and be filled [of the] spirit holy.
70465 ^ and immediately fell of him from the eyes [something] like scales,
70474 ^ he regained his sight also.
70476 ^ and
70477 ^ having risen up, he was baptized;
70479 ^ and
70480 ^ having taken food, he was strengthened.
70483 ^ he was now with the in damascus disciples days some.
70492 ^ and immediately in the synagogues he began proclaiming - jesus,
70500 ^ that he is the son - of god.
70507 ^ were amazed then
70509 ^ all - hearing,
70512 ^ and were saying,
70514 ^ not this is
70517 ^ the [one] having ravaged in jerusalem
70521 ^ those calling on the name this?
70526 ^ and here for this he had come,
70531 ^ that
70532 ^ having been bound, them he might bring to the chief priests.
70538 ^ saul however all the more was empowered,
70542 ^ and kept confounding the jews
70546 ^ - dwelling in damascus,
70550 ^ proving
70551 ^ that this is the christ.
70556 ^ when now had passed days many,
70561 ^ plotted together the jews
70564 ^ to kill him;
70566 ^ became known however - to saul the plot of them.
70573 ^ they were closely watching now also the gates day and also night,
70582 ^ so that him they might kill;
72089 ^ those indeed therefore having been scattered by the tribulation
72096 ^ - having taken place over stephen, passed through to phoenicia, and cyprus, and antioch,
72107 ^ to no one speaking the word
72111 ^ if not only to jews.
72115 ^ were however some of them, men of cyprus and of cyrene,
72124 ^ who
72125 ^ having come into antioch, were speaking also to the hellenists,
72133 ^ proclaiming the gospel — the lord jesus.
72137 ^ and was [the] hand of [the] lord with them;
72143 ^ [a] great then
72145 ^ number
72146 ^ - having believed, turned to the lord.
72152 ^ was heard now the report in the ears of the church
72161 ^ - being in jerusalem
72165 ^ concerning them,
72167 ^ and they sent forth barnabas
72170 ^ to go as far as antioch,
72173 ^ who
72174 ^ having come
72175 ^ and having seen the grace of - god, rejoiced
72183 ^ and was exhorting all
72186 ^ with resolute purpose - of heart to abide in the lord.
72193 ^ for he was a man good, and full of [the] spirit holy, and of faith.
72203 ^ and was added a crowd large to the lord.
72209 ^ he went forth then to tarsus
72213 ^ to seek saul,
72215 ^ and
72216 ^ having found [him], he brought [him] to antioch.
72220 ^ it came to pass [that] now they
72223 ^ also a year whole gathered together in the church
72230 ^ and taught a crowd large.
72234 ^ were called then first in antioch the disciples, christians.
72242 ^ in these now
72245 ^ - days came down from jerusalem prophets to antioch.
73462 ^ the [one] however - god raised up not did see decay.
73470 ^ known therefore be it
73473 ^ to you, men, brothers,
73476 ^ that through this one, to you forgiveness of sins is proclaimed.
73483 ^ and from all things
73486 ^ from which not you were able
73489 ^ in [the] law of moses to be justified,
73493 ^ in him
73495 ^ everyone - believing is justified.
73499 ^ take heed therefore,
73501 ^ lest might come about
73503 ^ that having been said in the prophets:
73508 ^ behold, - scoffers,
73511 ^ and wonder
73513 ^ and perish;
73515 ^ for a work am working i in the days of you,
73523 ^ a work
73524 ^ that never not you would believe,
73528 ^ even if one should declare it to you.’
73532 ^ having departed then, they
73535 ^ were begging
73536 ^ on the next sabbath to be spoken to them the words these.
73545 ^ having broken up then the synagogue,
73549 ^ followed many of the jews and of the
73555 ^ worshipping converts - paul and - barnabas,
73562 ^ who
73563 ^ speaking to them kept persuading them
73567 ^ to continue in the grace - of god.
73572 ^ on the now
73609 ^ to you it was necessary first to be spoken the word - of god;
73618 ^ but since you thrust away it
73621 ^ and not worthy you judge yourselves
73626 ^ - of eternal life,
73629 ^ behold,
73630 ^ we are turning to the gentiles.
73634 ^ thus for has commanded us the lord:
73640 ^ i have set you for a light of [the] gentiles,
73645 ^ - to be you for salvation to [the] uttermost part of the earth.’
75899 ^ those now escorting - paul brought [him] unto athens;
75907 ^ and
75908 ^ having received a command unto - silas and - timothy
75916 ^ that as quickly as possible they should come to him, they departed.
75923 ^ in now
75925 ^ - athens, waiting for them - of paul,
75931 ^ was provoked the spirit of him in him,
75937 ^ seeing
75938 ^ utterly idolatrous to be the city.
75942 ^ he was reasoning indeed therefore in the synagogue with the jews
75950 ^ and those worshiping,
75953 ^ and in the marketplace on every day
75960 ^ with those meeting [him].
75963 ^ some then also
75966 ^ of the epicureans and stoics, philosophers, encountered him.
75973 ^ and some were saying,
79192 ^ those then with me being, the indeed
79199 ^ light beheld;
79201 ^ the however
79203 ^ voice not did they hear
79662 ^ those who now stood by said,
79666 ^ the high priest - of god do you insult?
79671 ^ was saying then - paul,
79675 ^ not i was aware, brothers,
79678 ^ that he is high priest;
79681 ^ it has been written for
79683 ^ -: [the] ruler of the people of you, not you shall speak evil [of].’
79691 ^ having known then - paul
79695 ^ that the one part consists of sadducees,
79701 ^ - but
79703 ^ the other of pharisees, he began crying out in the council,
79709 ^ men, brothers, i a pharisee am,
79714 ^ [the] son of a pharisee;
79716 ^ concerning [the] hope and resurrection of [the] dead i am judged.
79723 ^ this then of him saying,
79727 ^ arose a dissension between the pharisees and sadducees,
79733 ^ and was divided the crowd.
79737 ^ sadducees indeed for say
79741 ^ not there to be resurrection,
79744 ^ nor angel,
79746 ^ nor spirit;
79748 ^ pharisees however confess - both.
79753 ^ arose then a clamor great,
79757 ^ and
79758 ^ having risen up some of the scribes of the party of the pharisees, they were contending,
79767 ^ saying,
79768 ^ nothing evil we find in the man this.
79775 ^ what if now a spirit has spoken to him,
79780 ^ or an angel?
79782 ^ great then arising dissension,
79786 ^ having feared the commander,
79789 ^ lest should be torn to pieces - paul by them, he commanded the troop,
79827 ^ so you it behooves also in rome to testify.
79834 ^ when it was then day,
80894 ^ where me it behooves to be judged.
80898 ^ to [the] jews nothing i have done wrong,
80901 ^ as also you very well know.
80906 ^ if indeed therefore i do wrong,
80910 ^ and worthy of death have done
80914 ^ anything,
80915 ^ not i do refuse
80917 ^ - to die.
80919 ^ if however nothing there is
81396 ^ to the name of jesus - of nazareth, i ought many things contrary to do,
81406 ^ which also i did in jerusalem;
81411 ^ and many also of the saints i in prisons locked up,
81420 ^ the from the chief priests authority having received;
81426 ^ being put to death then they,
81429 ^ i cast against [them] a vote.
81431 ^ and
81432 ^ in all the synagogues, often punishing them, i was compelling [them]
81440 ^ to blaspheme.
82250 ^ caesar you it behooves to stand before.
82254 ^ and behold,
82256 ^ has granted to you - god
82260 ^ all those sailing with you.
82265 ^ therefore take courage, men;
82268 ^ i believe for - god
82272 ^ that thus it will be,
82275 ^ according to the way it has been said to me.
82280 ^ upon an island however certain it behooves
82285 ^ us to fall.
82287 ^ when then the fourteenth night had come,
82292 ^ being driven about of us in the adriatic,
82297 ^ toward [the] middle of the night, began sensing the sailors
82304 ^ to be drawing near some to them
82307 ^ land.
82308 ^ and
82309 ^ having taken soundings, they found fathoms twenty.
82313 ^ a little then
82315 ^ having gone farther
82316 ^ and again having taken soundings, they found fathoms fifteen.
82322 ^ fearing then
82324 ^ lest somewhere on rocky places we might fall,
82330 ^ out of [the] stern having cast anchors four, they were praying for
82336 ^ day to come.
82338 ^ of the then
82340 ^ sailors seeking
82342 ^ to flee out of the ship
82346 ^ and having let down the lifeboat into the sea
82353 ^ under pretense as
82355 ^ from [the] bow anchors being about to cast out,
82360 ^ said - paul to the centurion and to the soldiers,
82368 ^ if not these remain in the ship,
82375 ^ you
82376 ^ to be saved not are able.
82379 ^ then cut away the soldiers the ropes of the lifeboat,
82387 ^ and allowed her
82390 ^ to fall away.
83921 ^ as many as for without [the] law have sinned, without [the] law also will perish;
83928 ^ and
83929 ^ as many as in [the] law have sinned, by [the] law will be judged;
83936 ^ not for the hearers of [the] law [are] righteous with - god,
83945 ^ but the doers of [the] law will be justified.
83950 ^ when for gentiles,
83953 ^ - not the law
83956 ^ having, by nature the things of the law do,
83962 ^ these
83963 ^ [the] law not having to themselves are a law,
83969 ^ who show the work of the law, written in the hearts of them,
83980 ^ bearing witness their - conscience,
83984 ^ and between one another, the thoughts accusing
83990 ^ or also defending [them] on [the] day
83995 ^ when will judge - god the secrets - of men, according to the gospel of me, by christ jesus.
84010 ^ if however you a jew are called,
84015 ^ and rely on [the] law,
84018 ^ and boast in god;
84022 ^ and know the will,
84026 ^ and approve
84028 ^ the things being superior,
84030 ^ being instructed out of the law;
84034 ^ are persuaded [that] then
84036 ^ you yourself a guide are,
84039 ^ of [the] blind, a light to those in darkness, an instructor of [the] foolish, a teacher of infants,
84048 ^ having the embodiment - of knowledge and of the truth in the law —
84059 ^ [you] then
84061 ^ teaching another, yourself not do you teach?
84066 ^ you preaching
84068 ^ not to steal, do you steal?
84071 ^ you saying
84073 ^ not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery?
84076 ^ you abhorring - idols, do you rob temples?
84081 ^ you who in law boast, through the transgression of the law, - god dishonor you?
84093 ^ - for,
84095 ^ [the] name - of god through you is blasphemed among the gentiles,”
84104 ^ as it has been written.
84106 ^ circumcision indeed - profits,
84110 ^ if [the] law you do;
84113 ^ if however a transgressor of law you are,
84118 ^ the circumcision of you uncircumcision has become.
84123 ^ if therefore the uncircumcision, the requirements of the law keeps,
84132 ^ not the uncircumcision of him for circumcision will be reckoned?
84139 ^ and will judge the by nature uncircumcision,
84145 ^ the law fulfilling, you who with [the] letter and circumcision [are] a transgressor of law.
84156 ^ not for the [one] on the outward a jew is;
84164 ^ neither the [one] outwardly, the outward in flesh, [is] circumcision;
84172 ^ but he who [is] on the inward a jew [is one];
84178 ^ and circumcision [is] of heart, in spirit, not in letter;
84185 ^ of whom the praise [is] not of men,
84191 ^ but of - god.
84195 ^ what then [is] the superiority of the jew?
84201 ^ or what [is] the benefit of the circumcision?
84207 ^ much in every way.
84211 ^ chiefly indeed for
84214 ^ that they were entrusted with the oracles - of god.
84220 ^ what for
84222 ^ if disbelieved some?
84225 ^ not the unbelief of them, the faithfulness - of god will nullify?
84234 ^ never may it be!
84236 ^ let be however - god true,
84241 ^ every now
84243 ^ man a liar,
84245 ^ as it has been written:
84247 ^ that - you may be justified in the words of you,
84254 ^ and will prevail
84256 ^ in - being judged your.”
84260 ^ if however the unrighteousness of us, god’s righteousness shows,
84268 ^ what shall we say?

84274 ^ - inflicting the wrath?
84278 ^ according to man i speak.
84281 ^ never may it be!
84283 ^ otherwise, how will judge - god the world?
84290 ^ if however the truth - of god, in - my lie, abounded to the glory of him,
84305 ^ why still also i as a sinner am judged?
84311 ^ and [is it] not,
84313 ^ as we are slanderously charged,
84315 ^ and as affirm some [that]
84319 ^ us to say
84321 ^ -, let us do things evil,
84325 ^ that may come the good things?
84329 ^ their - condemnation just is.
84334 ^ what then?
84336 ^ are we better?
84337 ^ not at all.
84339 ^ we have already charged for
84341 ^ jews both and greeks all under sin to be.
84349 ^ as it has been written
84351 ^ -: none there is righteous,
84355 ^ not even one;
84357 ^ none there is
84359 ^ - understanding;
84361 ^ none there is
84363 ^ - seeking after - god.
84367 ^ all have turned away,

84380 ^ a grave
84381 ^ having been opened the throat of them [is];
84385 ^ with the tongues of them they keep practicing deceit;
84389 ^ [the] venom of vipers [is] under the lips of them,
84395 ^ of whom the mouth of cursing and of bitterness is full;
84402 ^ swift [are] the feet of them
85471 ^ who we died - to sin, how still shall we live in it?
85480 ^ or are you unaware
85482 ^ that
85483 ^ as many as have been baptized into christ jesus, into the death of him have been baptized?
85493 ^ we were buried therefore with him through - baptism into - death,
85502 ^ so that just as was raised up christ out from [the] dead by the glory of the father,
85513 ^ so also we in newness of life should walk.
85520 ^ if for united we have become
85524 ^ in the likeness of the death of him,
85529 ^ certainly also of the resurrection we will be;
85534 ^ this knowing,
85536 ^ that - old of us self was crucified with [him],
85542 ^ so that might be annulled the body - of sin,
85548 ^ [that] no longer
85550 ^ are enslaved we - to sin.
85554 ^ the [one] for
85556 ^ having died has been freed from - sin.

85566 ^ we believe
85567 ^ that also we will live with him,
85571 ^ knowing
85572 ^ that christ,
85574 ^ having been raised up out from [the] dead, no more dies.
85579 ^ death him no longer rules over.
86163 ^ - for
86165 ^ to will is present with me,
86168 ^ - but
86170 ^ to do the good, not.
86174 ^ not for
86176 ^ that i desire i do
86179 ^ good,
86180 ^ but that not i do want
86184 ^ evil,
86185 ^ this i practice.
86187 ^ if now what not i do want,
86192 ^ i this do,
86195 ^ [it is] no longer i who do it,
86199 ^ but -
86201 ^ dwelling in me sin.
86205 ^ i find so the principle, that desiring me
86212 ^ to do - good,
86215 ^ that me - evil is present with.
86220 ^ i delight for in the law - of god, according to the inward man;
86230 ^ i see however another law in the members of me,
86369 ^ those for according to flesh
86373 ^ being, the things of the flesh mind;
86378 ^ those however
86380 ^ according to spirit, the things of the spirit.
86385 ^ the for
86387 ^ mind of the flesh [is] death;
86391 ^ the but
86393 ^ mind of the spirit, life and peace,
86399 ^ because the mind of the flesh [is] hostility toward god;
86407 ^ to for
86409 ^ [the] law - of god not it is subject,
86414 ^ nor even for can it [be].
86417 ^ those now in flesh
86421 ^ being,
86422 ^ god to please not are able.
86426 ^ you now not are in flesh,
86432 ^ but in spirit,
86435 ^ if indeed [the] spirit of god dwells in you;
86441 ^ if however anyone [the] spirit of christ not has,
86448 ^ he not is of him.
86452 ^ if however christ [is] in you,
86457 ^ the indeed
86459 ^ body [is] dead on account of sin,
86463 ^ the however
86465 ^ spirit [is] life on account of righteousness.
86469 ^ if now the spirit
86473 ^ of the [one] having raised up - jesus out from [the] dead dwells in you,
86482 ^ the [one] having raised up christ out from [the] dead will give life also to the mortal bodies of you, on account of - dwelling his spirit in you.
86500 ^ so then, brothers, debtors we are, not to the flesh,
86508 ^ - according to flesh
86511 ^ to live.
86512 ^ if for according to flesh you live,
86517 ^ you are about
86518 ^ to die;

86527 ^ you will live.
86528 ^ as many as for by [the] spirit of god are led,
86533 ^ these sons of god. are
86537 ^ not for you have received a spirit of bondage again to fear,
86545 ^ but you have received [the] spirit of divine adoption as sons,
86549 ^ by whom we cry,
86552 ^ abba! - father!
86555 ^ himself the spirit bears witness with the spirit of us
86562 ^ that we are children of god.

86569 ^ also heirs,
86571 ^ heirs indeed
86573 ^ of god,
86574 ^ joint-heirs now
86576 ^ of christ,
86577 ^ if indeed we suffer with [him],
86579 ^ so that also we may be glorified together.
86582 ^ i reckon for
86584 ^ that not comparable the sufferings of the present time [are] to the coming glory to be revealed to us.
86599 ^ the for
86601 ^ earnest expectation of the creation, the revelation of the sons - of god awaits.
86611 ^ to the for
86613 ^ futility, the creation was subjected,
86617 ^ not willingly,
86619 ^ but because of the [one] having subjected [it], in hope
86625 ^ that also itself the creation will be set free from the bondage - of decay, into the freedom of the glory of the children - of god.

86746 ^ we know now
86748 ^ that
86749 ^ to those loving - god, all things work together for good,
87640 ^ everyone - believing on him not will be put to shame.”
87647 ^ not for there is difference jew between and greek;
87655 ^ - for
87657 ^ the same lord of all
87660 ^ is rich
87661 ^ toward all those calling him.
87666 ^ whoever for
87668 ^ that - shall call upon the name of [the] lord will be saved.”
87675 ^ how then shall they call
87678 ^ on [him] whom not they believed?
87682 ^ how now shall they believe on [him]
87685 ^ of whom not they have heard?
87688 ^ how now shall they hear
87691 ^ apart from preaching?
87693 ^ how now shall they preach
87696 ^ if not they are sent?
87699 ^ as it has been written:
87701 ^ how beautiful the feet
87705 ^ of those proclaiming good news of good things!”
87709 ^ but not all heeded the good news.
87715 ^ isaiah for says,
87718 ^ lord, who has believed the report of us?”
87724 ^ so - faith [is] from hearing,
87729 ^ - and
87731 ^ hearing through [the] word of christ.
87735 ^ but i ask,
87737 ^ no not did they hear?
87740 ^ indeed: into all the earth has gone out the voice of them;
87749 ^ and to the ends of the world, the words of them.”
87758 ^ but i ask,
87760 ^ not israel not did know?
87764 ^ first, moses says:
87767 ^ i will provoke to jealousy you by [those] not a nation;
87773 ^ by a nation without understanding, i will anger you.”
87778 ^ isaiah then is very bold
87781 ^ and says:
87783 ^ i was found
87784 ^ by those me
87787 ^ not seeking;
87789 ^ manifest i became
87791 ^ to those me
87793 ^ not inquiring after.”
87795 ^ as for however,
87797 ^ - israel, he says:
87800 ^ all the day, i have stretched out the hands of me, to a people
87809 ^ disobeying
87810 ^ and contradicting.”
87812 ^ i ask then,
87814 ^ not did reject - god the people of him?
87821 ^ never may it be!
87823 ^ also for i an israelite am, of [the] seed of abraham, of [the] tribe of benjamin.
87833 ^ not did reject - god the people of him,
87840 ^ whom he foreknew.
87842 ^ or not know you
87845 ^ in elijah what says the scripture,
87851 ^ how he pleads - with god against - israel:
87858 ^ lord, the prophets of you they have killed;
87863 ^ the altars of you they have torn down;
87867 ^ and i have been left alone,
87870 ^ and they are seeking the life of me.”
87875 ^ but what [was] spoken to him the divine answer?
87881 ^ i have left to myself seven thousand men
87885 ^ who not have bowed [the] knee - to baal.”
87891 ^ thus then also, in the present time, a remnant according to [the] election of grace there has been.
87903 ^ if now by grace,
87906 ^ no longer from works;
87909 ^ otherwise - grace no longer would be grace.
87915 ^ what then?
87917 ^ what is seeking israel,
87920 ^ this not it has obtained;
87923 ^ - but
87925 ^ the elect obtained [it].
87927 ^ the now
87929 ^ rest were hardened,
87931 ^ as it has been written:
87933 ^ gave them - god a spirit of stupor, eyes
87940 ^ - not to see, and ears
87945 ^ - not to hear, unto the today day.”
87952 ^ and david says:
87955 ^ let be the table of them for a snare and for a trap, and for a stumbling block and for a retribution to them;
87971 ^ let be darkened the eyes of them,
87975 ^ - not to see,
87978 ^ and the backs of them, for ever bent over.”
87985 ^ i ask then,
87987 ^ not did they stumble
87989 ^ that they might fall?
87991 ^ never may it be!
87993 ^ but in the of them trespass - [is] salvation to the gentiles,
88001 ^ so as - to provoke to jealousy them.
88005 ^ if however, the trespass of them [is] riches of [the] world,
88012 ^ and the failure of them [is the] riches of [the] gentiles,
88018 ^ how much more the fullness of them!
88023 ^ to you now i am speaking,
88026 ^ the gentiles.
88028 ^ upon as much as indeed therefore am i of [the] gentiles apostle,
88036 ^ the ministry of me i magnify,
88040 ^ if at all i shall provoke to jealousy of me the flesh,
88046 ^ and shall save some of them.
88051 ^ if for the rejection of them [is the] reconciliation of [the] world,
88058 ^ what [will be] the acceptance,
88061 ^ if not life out from [the] dead?
88066 ^ if now the firstfruit [is] holy,
88071 ^ also the lump;
88074 ^ and if the root [is] holy,
88079 ^ also the branches.
88082 ^ if however some of the branches were broken off,
88088 ^ you now,
88090 ^ a wild olive tree being, were grafted in among them,
88095 ^ and a fellow-partaker of the root of the fatness of the olive tree have become,
88104 ^ not boast over the branches.
88108 ^ if now you boast against [them],
88111 ^ not you the root support,
88116 ^ but the root you.
88120 ^ you will say then,
88122 ^ were broken off branches,
88124 ^ that i might be grafted in.
88127 ^ rightly so;
88128 ^ by the unbelief they were broken off;
88131 ^ you however - by faith stand.
88136 ^ not high be minded,
88139 ^ but be afraid.
88141 ^ if for - god the according to nature branches not spared,
88151 ^ not at all neither you will he spare.
88156 ^ behold therefore [the] kindness and severity of god;
88458 ^ above what it behooves [you] to think,
88462 ^ but to think
88464 ^ so as - to be sober-minded,
88467 ^ to each as - god has allotted a measure of faith.
88474 ^ just as for, in one body many members we have,
88482 ^ - now
88484 ^ the members all not the same have
88490 ^ function;
88491 ^ so the many, one body we are in christ;
88499 ^ - and
88501 ^ individually one of another members.
88539 ^ - giving, in generosity;
88543 ^ - leading, with diligence;
88547 ^ - showing mercy, with cheerfulness.
88551 ^ [let] love [be] unfeigned:
88554 ^ abhorring - evil,
88557 ^ cleaving to - good, - in brotherly love to one another devoted
88565 ^ - in honor, one another esteeming,
88569 ^ - in diligence not lagging,
88573 ^ - in spirit being fervent,
88576 ^ the lord serving,
88579 ^ - in hope rejoicing,
88582 ^ - in tribulation being patient,
88585 ^ - in prayer being constant,
88588 ^ to the needs of the saints contributing,
88593 ^ - hospitality pursuing.
88596 ^ bless
88597 ^ those persecuting you.
88600 ^ bless
88601 ^ and not curse;
88604 ^ to rejoice
88605 ^ with the rejoicing,
88607 ^ to weep
88608 ^ with the weeping;
88711 ^ those however
88713 ^ existing,
88714 ^ by god having been instituted are.
88718 ^ therefore
88719 ^ the [one] resisting the authority, the - of god ordinance has resisted;
88728 ^ those now
88730 ^ having resisted upon themselves judgment will bring.
88734 ^ the for
88736 ^ rulers not are a terror - to good works,
88743 ^ but - to evil.
88746 ^ do you desire now
88748 ^ not to fear the authority?
88752 ^ the good do,
88755 ^ and you will have praise from him.
88760 ^ of god for
88762 ^ servant he is to you for - good.
88768 ^ if however - evil you do,
88773 ^ be afraid,
88774 ^ not for in vain the sword he bears;
88780 ^ of god for
88782 ^ a servant he is,
88784 ^ an avenger for wrath
88787 ^ to the [one] - evil
88790 ^ doing.
88791 ^ therefore necessary [it is]
88793 ^ to be subject, not only on account of the wrath,
88799 ^ but also on account of the conscience.
88804 ^ because of this for, also taxes pay you;
88810 ^ servants for
88812 ^ of god they are,
88814 ^ upon this very thing attending continually.
88818 ^ render to all their dues,
88822 ^ to whom the tax, the tax;
88827 ^ to whom the revenue, the revenue;
88832 ^ to whom the respect, the respect;
88837 ^ to whom the honor, the honor.
88842 ^ to no one nothing owe,
88845 ^ if not
88847 ^ - one another to love;
88850 ^ the [one] for
88852 ^ loving the other, [the] law has fulfilled.
88857 ^ - for,
88859 ^ not you shall commit adultery,
88861 ^ not you shall murder,
88863 ^ not you shall steal,
88865 ^ not you shall covet,” and if any other commandment, in the word this it is summed up,
88877 ^ in the [saying]: you shall love the neighbor of you as yourself.”
88885 ^ - love to the neighbor evil not does do;
88892 ^ [the] fulfillment therefore
88894 ^ of [the] law - love [is].
88897 ^ and this, knowing
88900 ^ the time,
88902 ^ that [it is the] hour already
88983 ^ the [one] however
88985 ^ being weak, vegetables eats.
88988 ^ the [one] eating,
88990 ^ the [one] not eating not let him despise;
88995 ^ the [one] now
88997 ^ not eating,
88999 ^ him eating not let him judge,
89003 ^ - god for him has received.
89008 ^ you who are,
89047 ^ the [one] regarding the day, to [the] lord regards [it];
89053 ^ and
89054 ^ the [one] eating, to [the] lord eats,
89058 ^ he gives thanks for - to god;
89062 ^ and
89063 ^ the [one] not eating, to [the] lord not he eats,
89069 ^ and he gives thanks - to god.
89073 ^ no one for
89075 ^ of us to himself lives,
89078 ^ and no one to himself dies.
89082 ^ if both for we should live,
89086 ^ to the lord we live;
89089 ^ if also we should die,
89092 ^ to the lord we die.
89095 ^ if both therefore we should live,
89099 ^ if also we should die,
89102 ^ the lord’s we are.
89105 ^ unto this for, christ died
89110 ^ and lived again,
89112 ^ that both [the] dead and
89116 ^ living he might rule over.
89118 ^ you however, why judge you the brother or you,
89125 ^ or also you why do despise the brother of you?
89133 ^ all for we will stand before the judgment seat of god.
89140 ^ it has been written for:
89142 ^ live i,
89144 ^ says [the] lord,
89146 ^ that to me will bow every knee,
89151 ^ and every tongue will confess - to god.”
89157 ^ so then, each of us concerning himself, account will give - to god.
89167 ^ no longer therefore one another should we judge;
89171 ^ but this determine rather,
89250 ^ the [one] for in these things
89254 ^ serving - christ [is] well-pleasing - to god and approved - by men.
89264 ^ so then, the things - of peace we should pursue,
89270 ^ and the things - for edification - among each other.
89277 ^ not for the sake of food, destroy the work - of god.
89285 ^ all things indeed [are] clean,
89288 ^ but [it is] wrong to the man
89292 ^ - through a stumbling block
89295 ^ eating.
89296 ^ [it is] good
89297 ^ - neither to eat meat,
89301 ^ nor to drink wine,
89304 ^ nor [anything]
89305 ^ in which the brother of you stumbles.
89311 ^ you [the] faith
89313 ^ that have, to yourself keep before - god.
89321 ^ blessed [is]
89322 ^ the [one] not judging himself
89326 ^ in what he approves.
89329 ^ the [one] however
89331 ^ doubting,
89332 ^ if he eats, has been condemned,
89335 ^ because [it is] not of faith;
89339 ^ everything now
89341 ^ that [is] not of faith, sin is.
89347 ^ we ought now, we who [are] strong,
89352 ^ the weaknesses of the weak to bear,
89357 ^ and not ourselves to please.
89361 ^ each of us the neighbor let please, unto the good, for edification.
89371 ^ even for - christ not himself pleased,
89378 ^ but as it has been written:
89381 ^ the reproaches
89383 ^ of those reproaching you have fallen on me.”
89389 ^ whatever for was written in the past, for - our instruction was written,
89397 ^ so that through - endurance and through the encouragement of the scriptures, - hope we might have.
89410 ^ the now
89412 ^ god - of endurance and - encouragement, may he give you
89420 ^ the same to be of mind with one another, according to christ jesus,
89428 ^ so that with one accord, with one mouth, you may glorify the god and father of the lord of us jesus christ.
89443 ^ therefore receive one another
89446 ^ as also - christ received you, to [the] glory - of god.
89456 ^ i say for,
89458 ^ christ a servant to have become
89461 ^ of [the] circumcision for [the] truth of god,
89465 ^ in order - to confirm the promises given to the fathers,
89472 ^ - and [for]
89474 ^ the gentiles, for mercy, to glorify - god,
89480 ^ as it has been written:
89482 ^ because of this i will praise you among [the] gentiles,
89488 ^ and to the name of you will i sing.”
89493 ^ and again it says:
89496 ^ rejoice you gentiles, with the people of him.”
89502 ^ and again:
89504 ^ praise all the gentiles, the lord;
89510 ^ and praise him, all the peoples.”
89516 ^ and again, isaiah says:
89520 ^ there will be the root - of jesse, and
89526 ^ the [one] arising
89528 ^ to rule over gentiles;
89530 ^ in him [the] gentiles will hope.”
89534 ^ - and
89536 ^ the god - of hope may fill you with all joy and peace,
89545 ^ in - believing;
89548 ^ for - to abound you in - hope in [the] power [of the] spirit holy.
89559 ^ i am persuaded now, brothers of me, also myself i concerning you,
89568 ^ that also you yourselves full are
89573 ^ of goodness,
89574 ^ being filled with all - knowledge,
89578 ^ being able also
89580 ^ one another to admonish.
89582 ^ more boldly however i have written to you, in part,
89588 ^ as reminding you, because of the grace
89594 ^ - having been given to me by - god
89600 ^ for - to be me a minister christ of jesus to the gentiles,
89610 ^ administering the sacred service of the gospel - of god,
89615 ^ so that might become the offering of the gentiles acceptable,
89622 ^ having been sanctified in [the] spirit holy.
89626 ^ i have therefore the boasting in christ jesus, in the things pertaining to - god.
89637 ^ not for will i dare
89640 ^ anything to speak of,
89694 ^ to whom not it was proclaimed concerning him; they will see,
89700 ^ and
89701 ^ those that not have heard will understand.”
89705 ^ therefore also i have been hindered - many [times]
89710 ^ - to come to you.
89714 ^ now however, no longer a place having in the regions these,
89723 ^ a great desire now having had
90808 ^ the [one] boasting, in [the] lord let him boast.”
90813 ^ and i,
90814 ^ having come to you, brothers, came not according to excellency of speech, or wisdom,
90825 ^ proclaiming to you the mystery - of god.
90831 ^ nothing for i decided
90834 ^ anything to know among you,
90838 ^ if not jesus christ, and him
90844 ^ having been crucified.
90845 ^ and i, in weakness, and in fear, and in trembling much, was with you.
90858 ^ and the message of me and the preaching of me [were] not in persuasive of wisdom words,
90871 ^ but in demonstration of [the] spirit and of power,
90877 ^ so that the faith of you not might be in wisdom of men,
90886 ^ but in power of god.
90890 ^ wisdom however we speak among the mature;
90896 ^ wisdom however,
90898 ^ not the age of this, nor of the rulers the age of this,
90908 ^ who are coming to naught.
90910 ^ but we speak of god wisdom in a mystery,
91389 ^ [he is] the [one] catching the wise in the craftiness of them.”
91397 ^ and again,
91399 ^ [the] lord knows the thoughts of the wise,
91405 ^ that they are futile.”
91408 ^ therefore no one let boast in men.
91413 ^ all things for of you are,
91417 ^ whether paul, or apollos, or cephas, or [the] world, or life, or death,
91429 ^ or things present,
91431 ^ or things to come—
91433 ^ all yours,
91435 ^ you now of christ,
91438 ^ christ now of god.
91441 ^ so us, let regard a man as servants of christ and stewards of the mysteries of god.
91452 ^ in this case moreover, it is required in the stewards,
91458 ^ that faithful one shall be found.
91462 ^ me however to the smallest matter it is,
91467 ^ that by you i be examined,
91471 ^ or by a human court.
91475 ^ in fact neither myself do i examine.
91479 ^ nothing for against myself i am conscious of,
91483 ^ yet not by this have i been justified;
91488 ^ the [one] however
91490 ^ judging me [the] lord is.
91494 ^ so then, not before [the] time anything judge,
91500 ^ until - shall have come the lord,
91505 ^ who both will bring to light the hidden things - of darkness,
91512 ^ and will make manifest the motives of the hearts;
91518 ^ and then the praise will come to each from - god.
91527 ^ these things now, brothers, i have applied to myself and apollos on account of you,
91537 ^ so that in us you may learn
91541 ^ -, not
91543 ^ beyond what has been written,
91546 ^ that not one for - one you be puffed up over the other.
91556 ^ who for you makes different?
91560 ^ what now have you
91563 ^ which not you did receive?
91566 ^ if now also you did receive [it],
91570 ^ why boast you
91572 ^ as not
91574 ^ having received [it]?
92057 ^ the [ones] being despised in the church,
92062 ^ those set you up!
92064 ^ for shame to you i say this. thus
92069 ^ not is there among you no one, a wise [man],
92075 ^ who will be able
92077 ^ to decide in between the brother of him?
92083 ^ instead, brother against brother goes to law,
92088 ^ and this before unbelievers!
92092 ^ already indeed therefore altogether a defeat for you it is,
92099 ^ that lawsuits you have among one another.
92104 ^ because of why not rather suffer wrong?
92109 ^ because of why not rather be defrauded?
92114 ^ but you do wrong
92117 ^ and defraud,
92119 ^ and these things to brothers!
92122 ^ or not know you
92125 ^ that [the] unrighteous ones of god [the] kingdom not will inherit?
92131 ^ not be deceived:
92133 ^ neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor coveters, not drunkards, nor verbal abusers, nor swindlers, [the] kingdom of god will inherit.
92156 ^ and such some [of] you were;
92160 ^ but you were washed,
92162 ^ but you were sanctified,
92164 ^ but you were justified, in the name of the lord jesus christ and by the spirit of the god of us.
92180 ^ all things to me are lawful,
92183 ^ but not all things do profit.
92187 ^ all things to me are lawful,
92190 ^ but not i will be mastered by anything.
92196 ^ the foods for the belly
92200 ^ and the belly the for foods,
92205 ^ - but
92207 ^ god both this and these will destroy;
92213 ^ - and
92215 ^ the body [is] not - for sexual immorality,
92219 ^ but for the lord,
92222 ^ and the lord for the body.
92227 ^ - and
92229 ^ god both the lord has raised up,
92234 ^ and us will raise out, by the power of him.
92241 ^ not know you
92243 ^ that the bodies of you members of christ are?
92280 ^ the [one] however
92282 ^ being joined to the lord, one spirit is.
92288 ^ flee - sexual immorality.
92291 ^ every sin,
92293 ^ whatever if might do a man, outside the body is;
92301 ^ the [one] however
92303 ^ sinning sexually, against the own body sins.
92309 ^ or not know you
92312 ^ that the body of you a temple of the in you holy spirit is,
92323 ^ whom you have from god?
92327 ^ and not you are your own,
92331 ^ you were bought for with a price;
92334 ^ glorify therefore - god in the body of you.
92342 ^ concerning now
92344 ^ the things about which you wrote:
92346 ^ [it is] good for a man
92348 ^ a woman not to touch.
92351 ^ because of however
92353 ^ - sexual immorality, each man the [own] of him wife let have,
92360 ^ and each [woman] the own husband let have.
92366 ^ to the wife, the husband the duty let fulfill;
92373 ^ likewise now also, the wife to the husband.
92380 ^ the wife, the own body not has authority over,
92387 ^ but the husband;
92390 ^ likewise now, also the husband of the own body not has authority over,
92400 ^ but the wife.
92403 ^ not deprive one another,
92406 ^ if not - by mutual agreement, for a time,
92413 ^ that you might be at leisure - for prayer;
92417 ^ and again, together the same be,
92423 ^ so that not may tempt you - satan, through the lack of self-control of you.
92433 ^ this now i say by way of concession,
92438 ^ not by way of command.
92441 ^ i wish now
92443 ^ all men to be like even myself.
92449 ^ but each his own has
92453 ^ gift from god;
92456 ^ one [has] indeed this,
92459 ^ one however that.
92462 ^ i say now to the unmarried and to the widows,
92469 ^ [it is] good for them
92471 ^ if they should remain as even i.
92475 ^ if however not they have self-control,
92479 ^ let them marry;
92480 ^ better for it is
92483 ^ to marry
92484 ^ than
92485 ^ to burn with passion.
92856 ^ the [one] however
92858 ^ having been married, cares for the things of the world,
92863 ^ how he should please the wife,
92867 ^ and is divided.
92869 ^ and the woman - unmarried and - virgin, cares for the things of the lord,
92881 ^ that she should be holy both in body and in spirit;
92890 ^ the [one] however
92892 ^ having been married, cares for the things of the world,
92897 ^ how she should please the husband.
92901 ^ this now for the of you yourselves benefit i say,
92909 ^ not that a restraint you i might place upon,
92914 ^ but for what [is] seemly and devoted to the lord, without distraction.
92923 ^ if however anyone
92926 ^ to be behaving improperly to the virgin of him supposes,
92932 ^ if she is beyond youth,
92935 ^ and
92936 ^ so it ought to be,
93466 ^ those at the altar
93469 ^ attending, in the altar partake?
93473 ^ so also, the lord has prescribed
93478 ^ to those the gospel
93481 ^ proclaiming
93482 ^ from the gospel to live.
93486 ^ i however not have used none of these.
93492 ^ neither have i written now, these things
93496 ^ that thus it should be with me;
93501 ^ [it were] good for me rather
93505 ^ to die,
93506 ^ than the boasting of me, anyone will make void.
93512 ^ if for i preach the gospel,
93515 ^ nothing there is to me boasting;
93519 ^ necessity for me is laid upon.
93523 ^ woe however to me be,
93527 ^ if not i should preach the gospel.
93530 ^ if for willingly this i do,
93535 ^ a reward i have;
93537 ^ if however unwillingly,
93540 ^ a stewardship i am entrusted with.
93542 ^ what then of me is
93546 ^ the reward?
93548 ^ that
93549 ^ in preaching the gospel free of charge, i should offer the gospel,
93554 ^ so as - not
93557 ^ to use up the right of me in the gospel.
93661 ^ everyone now
93663 ^ - striving, in all things controls himself;
93667 ^ they indeed then,
93670 ^ that a perishable crown they might receive,
93674 ^ we however an imperishable.
93677 ^ i therefore thus run, as not uncertainly;
93684 ^ so i fight,
93686 ^ as not [the] air beating.
93690 ^ but i batter of me the body
93695 ^ and bring [it] into servitude,
93697 ^ not hardly
93699 ^ to others having preached, myself disqualified i might be.
93704 ^ not i want for you
93708 ^ to be ignorant, brothers,
93710 ^ that the fathers of us all under the cloud were,
93719 ^ and all through the sea passed,
93725 ^ and all into - moses were baptized, in the cloud and in the sea,
93738 ^ and all the same spiritual food ate,
93745 ^ and all the same spiritual drank
93751 ^ drink;
93752 ^ they were drinking for from [the] spiritual
93756 ^ accompanying [them] rock;
93758 ^ the rock then was - christ.
93764 ^ nevertheless not with - most of them was well pleased - god;
93773 ^ they were strewn for in the wilderness.
93778 ^ these things now, types to us have become,
93783 ^ for - not
93786 ^ to be us desirers of evil things,
93790 ^ as they also desired.
93793 ^ neither idolaters are you to be,
93796 ^ as some of them;
93799 ^ as it has been written:
93801 ^ sat down the people
93804 ^ to eat
93805 ^ and to drink,
93807 ^ and rose up
93809 ^ to play.”
93810 ^ neither should we commit sexual immorality,
93812 ^ as some of them committed sexual immorality,
93816 ^ and fell in one day twenty three thousand.
93823 ^ neither should we test the christ,
93827 ^ as some of them tested,
93831 ^ and by - serpents were destroyed.
93836 ^ neither are you to grumble,
93838 ^ as some of them grumbled,
93842 ^ and perished by the destroyer.
93847 ^ these things now [as] types happened to them,
93852 ^ were written then for admonition of us,
93857 ^ to whom the ends of the ages are arrived.
93864 ^ therefore
93865 ^ the [one] thinking
93867 ^ to stand, let him take heed,
93869 ^ lest he fall.
93871 ^ temptation you not has seized,
93875 ^ if not what is common to man;
93878 ^ faithful now - [is] god,
93882 ^ who not will allow
93885 ^ you to be tempted
95376 ^ the [one] for
95378 ^ speaking in a tongue, not to men speaks,
95383 ^ but to god;
95385 ^ no one for hears;
95388 ^ in the spirit however, he utters mysteries.
95392 ^ the [one] however
95394 ^ prophesying, to men speaks [for] edification, and encouragement, and consolation.
95402 ^ the [one] speaking in a tongue, himself edifies;
95407 ^ the [one] however
95409 ^ prophesying, [the] church edifies.
95412 ^ i desire now
95414 ^ all you to speak in tongues,
95418 ^ rather however that you should prophesy;
95422 ^ greater [is] now
95424 ^ the [one] prophesying
95426 ^ than
95427 ^ the [one] speaking in tongues,
95430 ^ except if not he should interpret,
95434 ^ so that the church edification might receive.
95439 ^ now however brothers,
95442 ^ if i should come to you
95446 ^ in tongues speaking, what you will i profit,
95451 ^ if not to you i should speak either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in teaching?
95467 ^ even - lifeless things
95470 ^ a sound giving, whether flute or harp, if distinction to the sounds not they give,
95482 ^ how will it be known
95484 ^ what [is] being piped
95486 ^ or - being harped?
95489 ^ also for if indistinct [the] trumpet
95494 ^ sound gives,
95496 ^ who will prepare himself for battle?
95500 ^ so also you, with the tongue if not intelligible speech you give,
95511 ^ how will it be known
95513 ^ what [is] being spoken?
95515 ^ you will be for
95517 ^ into [the] air speaking.
95520 ^ so many
95521 ^ if it may be
95523 ^ kinds of languages there are in [the] world,
95528 ^ and none without meaning.
95531 ^ if therefore not i know the power of the sound,
95539 ^ i will be
95540 ^ to the [one] speaking a foreigner,
95543 ^ and
95544 ^ the [one] speaking to me a foreigner.
95549 ^ so also you, since zealous you are
95555 ^ of spiritual gifts,
95556 ^ for the edification of the church, search
95562 ^ that you should cause [it] to abound.
95564 ^ therefore
95565 ^ the [one] speaking in a tongue, let him pray
95569 ^ that he might interpret.
95571 ^ if for i pray in a tongue,
95575 ^ the spirit of me prays,
95579 ^ - but
95581 ^ the mind of me unfruitful is.
95585 ^ what then is it?
95588 ^ i will pray with the spirit,
95591 ^ i will pray however also with the mind.
95596 ^ i will sing praise with the spirit,
95599 ^ i will sing praise however also with the mind.
95604 ^ otherwise if you bless with the spirit,
95609 ^ the [one] filling the place of the uninstructed, how will he say the amen at - your thanksgiving,
95623 ^ since
95624 ^ what you say not he knows?
95628 ^ you truly for well are giving thanks,
95633 ^ but the other not is edified.
95638 ^ i thank - god
95641 ^ than all of you more, in tongues speaking;
95646 ^ but
95647 ^ in [the] church, i desire five words with [the] mind of me to speak
95656 ^ that also others i might instruct,
95660 ^ rather than ten thousand words in a tongue.
95665 ^ brothers, not children be in the minds.
95671 ^ yet in the evil, be little children;
95675 ^ in the however
95677 ^ thinking, full grown be.
95680 ^ in the law it has been written
95684 ^ -: by other tongues, and by lips other, i will speak to the people this,
95695 ^ and not even thus will they hear me,
95700 ^ says [the] lord.”
95702 ^ so then - tongues for a sign are, not
95709 ^ to those believing,
95711 ^ but to the unbelieving;
95714 ^ - but
95716 ^ prophecy [is] not to the unbelieving,
95720 ^ but
95721 ^ to the believing.
95723 ^ if therefore gathers the church whole together the place,
95732 ^ and all should speak in tongues,
95736 ^ come in however uninstructed ones or unbelievers,
95741 ^ not will they say
95743 ^ that you are mad?
95745 ^ if however all prophesy,
95749 ^ should come in then some unbeliever or uninstructed,
95755 ^ he is convicted by all,
95758 ^ he is examined by all,
95761 ^ the secrets of the heart of him manifest become.
95768 ^ and thus
95770 ^ having fallen upon [his] face, he will worship - god,
95776 ^ declaring
95777 ^ that certainly - god among you is.
95784 ^ what then is it, brothers?
95788 ^ when you may come together,
95790 ^ each a psalm has,
95793 ^ a teaching has,
95795 ^ a revelation has,
95797 ^ a tongue has,
95799 ^ an interpretation has.
95801 ^ all things for edification let be done.
95805 ^ if with a tongue anyone speaks,
95809 ^ [let it be] by two or the most three, and in turn;
95818 ^ and one let interpret.
95821 ^ if however not there is an interpreter,
95826 ^ let him be silent in [the] church;
95829 ^ to himself then let him speak,
95832 ^ and - to god.
95835 ^ prophets then,
95837 ^ two or three let speak,
95841 ^ and the others let discern.
95845 ^ if however to another a revelation should be made
98524 ^ the things for
98526 ^ being seen [are] temporary;
98528 ^ the things however not
98531 ^ being seen [are] eternal.
98533 ^ we know for
98535 ^ that if - earthly of us house,
98541 ^ the tent, should be destroyed,
98544 ^ a building from god we have,
98548 ^ a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
98554 ^ and indeed, in this we groan,
98597 ^ the [one] now
98599 ^ having prepared us for very this [is] god,
98605 ^ - having given to us the pledge of the spirit,
98612 ^ being confident therefore always
98615 ^ and knowing
98617 ^ that,
98618 ^ being at home in the body, we are absent from the lord;
98626 ^ by faith for we walk,
98630 ^ not by sight.
98633 ^ we are confident now,
98635 ^ and are pleased, rather
98638 ^ to be absent out of the body,
98642 ^ and to be at home with the lord.
98647 ^ therefore also we are ambitious,
98650 ^ whether being at home
98652 ^ or being away, well-pleasing to him to be.
98657 ^ - for
98659 ^ all of us to be revealed it behooves
98663 ^ before the judgment seat - of christ,
98668 ^ that may receive back each the things [done] in the body,
98675 ^ according to what he did,
98678 ^ whether good
98680 ^ or evil.
99334 ^ thing, according to god
99337 ^ to have been grieved, how much has produced in you
99341 ^ earnestness, but instead reasoned defense, but indignation, but fear, but longing, but zeal, but vindication!
99354 ^ in everything, you have proved
99357 ^ yourselves innocent to be in this matter.
99362 ^ so if even i wrote to you,
99367 ^ [it was] not
99368 ^ for the sake of the [one] having done wrong,
99371 ^ nor for the sake of the [one] having suffered wrong,
99375 ^ but rather for the sake of - being revealed the earnestness of you, which [is] for us to you before - god.
99390 ^ on account of this, we have been comforted.
99393 ^ besides now
99395 ^ the comfort of us, the more abundantly rather we have rejoiced at the joy of titus,
99405 ^ because has been refreshed the spirit of him by all of you.
99413 ^ for if anything to him about you i have boasted,
99420 ^ not i was put to shame;
99422 ^ but as all things in truth we have spoken to you,
99429 ^ so also the boasting of us - to titus, truth became.
99439 ^ and the affections of him more abundantly toward you are,
99447 ^ remembering the of all of you obedience,
99452 ^ how with fear and trembling you received him.
99459 ^ i rejoice
99460 ^ that in everything i am confident in you.
99466 ^ we make known now to you, brothers, the grace - of god
99474 ^ - having been bestowed among the churches - of macedonia,
99481 ^ that in much proof of tribulation, the abundance of the joy of them and - of deep poverty of them abounded into the riches the generosity of them.
99504 ^ for according to [their] ability, i testify [that],
99508 ^ and beyond [their] ability,
99511 ^ [they were] willing of themselves, with much entreaty
99515 ^ imploring of us, for the grace and the fellowship of the service - among the saints.
99528 ^ and not [only] as we had hoped,
99532 ^ but themselves they gave, first to the lord, and then to us, by [the] will of god.
99543 ^ accordingly - exhorted we titus,
99548 ^ that as he had begun,
99551 ^ so also he might complete with you as well, the grace this.
99560 ^ but even as in every [way] you abound, in faith, and speech, and knowledge, and all earnestness, and in the from us to you love,
99580 ^ that also in this - grace you should abound.
99587 ^ not as a command do i speak,
99591 ^ but
99592 ^ through the of others earnestness, also the - of your love genuineness proving.
99603 ^ you know for the grace of the lord of us jesus christ,
99612 ^ that for the sake of you he became poor,
99616 ^ rich being,
99618 ^ so that you - through that poverty might be enriched.
99624 ^ and a judgment in this [matter] i give,
99629 ^ this indeed for you is profitable,
99633 ^ who not only
99636 ^ - to act,
99638 ^ but also - to will, have begun from a year ago.
99645 ^ now then also
99648 ^ the doing complete;
99651 ^ so that just as [there was] the readiness
99655 ^ of the to will,
99657 ^ so also
99659 ^ the to complete,
99661 ^ out of that which you have.
99664 ^ if for the readiness is present,
99669 ^ as if he might have
99672 ^ acceptable,
99673 ^ not as not he does have.
99677 ^ not for
99679 ^ that to others [there may be] ease
99682 ^ but for you affliction,
99684 ^ but of equality.
99687 ^ at the present time, - your abundance [will be] for the of those need,
99698 ^ so that also - their abundance may be for the of you need,
99708 ^ so that there may be equality.
99711 ^ as it has been written:
99713 ^ he the much not did abound,
99718 ^ and he the little not had lack.”
99724 ^ thanks however - to god,
99728 ^ the [one] putting the same earnestness for you into the heart of titus.
99739 ^ for [our] indeed
99742 ^ appeal he accepted,
99984 ^ the [one] sowing sparingly, sparingly also will reap;
99990 ^ and
99991 ^ the [one] sowing upon blessings, upon blessings also will reap,
99999 ^ each
100000 ^ as he purposes in the heart,
100004 ^ not out of regret or of necessity;
100010 ^ a cheerful for
100012 ^ giver loves - god.
100016 ^ able [is] now - god
100020 ^ all grace to make abound to you,
100025 ^ so that
100026 ^ in every [way], always, all sufficiency having, you may abound in every work good.
100037 ^ as it has been written:
100039 ^ he has scattered abroad,
100040 ^ he has given to the poor,
100043 ^ the righteousness of him abides to the age.”
100050 ^ the [one] now
100052 ^ supplying seed
100054 ^ to him sowing and bread for food will supply
100061 ^ and will multiply the seed for sowing of you
100066 ^ and will increase the fruits of the righteousness of you,
100073 ^ in every [way] enriching you to all generosity,
100079 ^ which produces, through us, thanksgiving - to god.
100086 ^ for the ministry of the service this
100092 ^ not only is
100095 ^ completely filling up the needs of the saints,
100100 ^ but also is overflowing through many thanksgivings - to god,
100452 ^ the [one] however
100454 ^ boasting, in [the] lord let him boast.”
100458 ^ not for
100460 ^ the [one] himself
100462 ^ commending,
100463 ^ this [one] is approved,
100466 ^ but
100467 ^ the one whom the lord commends.
100471 ^ i wish you were bearing with me little a in foolishness,
100477 ^ but indeed you do bear with me.
100481 ^ i am jealous as to for you of god with [the] jealousy;
100486 ^ i have betrothed for you to one husband,
100491 ^ a virgin pure to present - to christ.
100496 ^ i am afraid however,
100498 ^ lest by any means as the serpent deceived eve in the craftiness of him,
100509 ^ might be corrupted the minds of you from the simplicity and the purity - in - christ.
100523 ^ if indeed for
100526 ^ the [one] coming, another jesus proclaims,
100531 ^ whom not we did proclaim,
100534 ^ or a spirit different you receive
100538 ^ which not you did receive,
100541 ^ or glad tidings different
100544 ^ which not you did accept,
100547 ^ well are you bearing with [it].
100549 ^ i reckon for
100551 ^ in nothing to have been inferior
100553 ^ to those most eminent apostles.
100556 ^ if however, even unpolished - in speech [i am],
100562 ^ yet not - in knowledge;
100566 ^ but
100567 ^ in every [way], we have been made manifest in all things to you.
100574 ^ or a sin did i commit,
100577 ^ myself humbling
100579 ^ so that you might be exalted,
100582 ^ because freely the - of god gospel i preached to you?
100590 ^ other churches i robbed,
100593 ^ having received support for the toward you service.
100599 ^ and
100600 ^ being present with you
100603 ^ and having been in need, not i did burden no one;
100608 ^ - for
100610 ^ the need of me completely filled up the brothers
100615 ^ having come from macedonia,
100618 ^ and in everything unburdensome myself to you i kept,
100625 ^ and will keep.
100627 ^ is [the] truth of christ in me,
100632 ^ that the boasting this not will be sealed up of mine in the regions - of achaia.
100645 ^ because of why?
100647 ^ because not i do love you?
100651 ^ - god knows [i do]!
100970 ^ to boast it behooves [me];
100972 ^ not is it profitable indeed.
100975 ^ i will go on however to visions and revelations of [the] lord.
100982 ^ i know a man in christ, ago years fourteen —
100989 ^ whether in [the] body,
100992 ^ not i know,
100994 ^ or out of the body,
100998 ^ not i know,
101000 ^ - god knows —
101003 ^ having been caught up - such a man to [the] third heaven.
101009 ^ and i know - such a man —
101014 ^ whether in [the] body
101017 ^ or out of the body,
101021 ^ not i know,
101023 ^ - god knows —
101026 ^ that he was caught up into - paradise,
101031 ^ and he heard inexpressible words,
101035 ^ - not being permitted to man to speak.
101040 ^ concerning - such a man i will boast;
101044 ^ concerning however
101046 ^ myself, not i will boast,
101049 ^ if not in the weaknesses.
101054 ^ if for i should desire
101057 ^ to boast,
101058 ^ not i will be a fool;
101061 ^ [the] truth for i will be speaking.
101064 ^ i refrain however,
101066 ^ lest anyone to me should credit
101071 ^ more than what he sees in me,
101075 ^ or hears anyone of me,
101080 ^ and the surpassingness of the revelations.
101085 ^ therefore that not i should become conceited,
101089 ^ was given to me a thorn in [my] flesh, a messenger of satan,
101096 ^ that me he might buffet,
101099 ^ so that not i should become conceited.
101102 ^ for this, three times the lord i begged,
101108 ^ that it might depart from me.
101112 ^ and he said to me,
101115 ^ suffices you the grace of me;
101120 ^ the for
101122 ^ power in weakness is perfected.
101126 ^ most gladly therefore rather will i boast in the weaknesses of me,
101134 ^ so that may rest upon me the power - of christ.
101142 ^ therefore i take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, and difficulties for christ;
101156 ^ when for i might be weak,
101159 ^ then strong i am.
101162 ^ i have become a fool;
101164 ^ you me compelled.
101167 ^ i for ought
101170 ^ by you to have been commended.
101173 ^ in no way for was i inferior
101176 ^ to those most eminent apostles,
101179 ^ though even nothing i am.
101183 ^ the indeed
101185 ^ signs of the apostle were performed among you in all perseverance, in signs both, and wonders, and miracles.
101200 ^ in what for is it
101203 ^ that you were inferior beyond the rest [of the] churches,
101209 ^ if not that myself i not did burden you?
101217 ^ forgive me the wrong this!
101222 ^ behold,
101223 ^ third time this, ready i am
102071 ^ whatsoever formerly they were, not to me makes a difference;
102077 ^ [the] person - god
102080 ^ of a man not does accept —
102083 ^ to me for
102085 ^ the esteemed nothing added.
102089 ^ but on the contrary,
102091 ^ having seen
102092 ^ that i have been entrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision,
102098 ^ just as peter [with that] of the circumcision
102102 ^ the [one] for
102104 ^ having worked in peter for apostleship of the circumcision did also in me toward the gentiles —
102116 ^ and having known the grace
102120 ^ - having been given to me, james and cephas and john,
102128 ^ those esteemed
102130 ^ pillars to be, [the] right hands gave to me and barnabas,
102137 ^ of fellowship,
102138 ^ that we [should go] to the gentiles;
102143 ^ they however to the circumcision.
102148 ^ only [they asked]
102149 ^ the poor that we should remember,
102153 ^ that also i was eager
102156 ^ the same thing to do.
102159 ^ when however came peter to antioch,
102165 ^ to face his i opposed [him],
102169 ^ because
102170 ^ condemned he stood.
102481 ^ as many as for of works of [the] law are, under a curse are;
102490 ^ it has been written for
102492 ^ -: cursed [is] everyone
102495 ^ who not does continue
102498 ^ all things - having been written in the book of the law,
102506 ^ - to do them.”
102509 ^ that now by [the] law no one is justified before - god [is] evident,
102519 ^ because the righteous by faith will live.”
102525 ^ - and
102527 ^ the law not is of faith;
102532 ^ rather,
102533 ^ the [one] having done these things will live by them.”
102539 ^ christ us redeemed from the curse of the law,
102547 ^ having become for us a curse,
102551 ^ for it has been written:
102553 ^ cursed [is]
102554 ^ everyone - hanging on a tree”
102559 ^ so that to the gentiles the blessing - of abraham might come, in christ, jesus
102571 ^ so that the promise of the spirit we might receive, through - faith.
102580 ^ brothers, according to man i am speaking.
102584 ^ even of man
102586 ^ having been ratified a covenant, no one sets aside
102590 ^ or adds thereto.
102592 ^ - and
102594 ^ to abraham were spoken the promises,
102598 ^ and to the seed of him.
102602 ^ not it does say,
102604 ^ and - to seeds, as of many;
102610 ^ but as of one,
102614 ^ and to the seed of you,”
102618 ^ who is christ.
102621 ^ this now i say:
102624 ^ [the] covenant,
102625 ^ having been confirmed beforehand by - god, -
102630 ^ afterward four hundred and thirty years having come, [the] law not does annul,
102639 ^ so as - to nullify the promise.
102644 ^ if for by [the] law [is] the inheritance,
102650 ^ [it is] no longer by a promise;
102653 ^ - but
102655 ^ to abraham through a promise has granted [it] - god.
102661 ^ why then the law?
102665 ^ - transgressions
102667 ^ on account of, it was added,
102669 ^ until that should have come the seed
102674 ^ to whom promise has been made,
102676 ^ having been ordained through angels in [the] hand of a mediator.
102682 ^ - however,
102684 ^ a mediator of one [person] not is;
102688 ^ - but
102690 ^ god one is.
102693 ^ the therefore
102695 ^ law [is] contrary to the promises - of god?
102701 ^ never may it be!
102703 ^ if for had been given a law
102707 ^ - being able
102709 ^ to impart life,
102710 ^ indeed from out of [the] law - would have emerged - righteousness;
102717 ^ but imprisoned the scripture things all under sin,
102725 ^ so that the promise, by faith from jesus christ, might be given
102733 ^ to those believing.
102781 ^ as many as for into christ you were baptized, christ you have put on.
102788 ^ neither there is jew nor greek;
102793 ^ neither there is slave nor free;
102798 ^ neither there is male and female;
102803 ^ all for
102805 ^ you one are in christ jesus.
102811 ^ if now you [are] christ’s,
102815 ^ then - abraham’s seed you are, according to [the] promise heirs.
102823 ^ i say now,
102825 ^ for as long as time the heir a child is,
102832 ^ not he differs from a slave,
102835 ^ [though] owner of everything being.
102838 ^ instead, under guardians he is,
102842 ^ and trustees, until the time appointed by [his] father.
102849 ^ so also we, when we were children,
103370 ^ the [one] however
103372 ^ troubling you will bear the judgment,
103377 ^ whoever if he might be.
103380 ^ i now, brothers,
103383 ^ if circumcision still proclaim,
103387 ^ why still am i persecuted?
103390 ^ in that case has been abolished the offense of the cross.
103396 ^ i wish also will emasculate themselves
103399 ^ those upsetting you.
103402 ^ you for to freedom were called, brothers;
103408 ^ but not the freedom for an opportunity to the flesh.
103416 ^ rather through - love, serve one another.
103422 ^ - for
103424 ^ the entire law in one word is fulfilled
103686 ^ the [one] however
103688 ^ sowing to the spirit, from the spirit will reap life eternal.
105031 ^ - and, he ascended,” what is
105036 ^ if not
105038 ^ that also he descended into the lower regions of the earth?
105047 ^ the [one]
105048 ^ having descended, the same is also
105052 ^ [one] having ascended above all the heavens,
105058 ^ so that he might fill - all things.
105062 ^ and he gave some indeed [to be] apostles, some now prophets, some now evangelists, some now shepherds and teachers, toward the perfecting of the saints, for [the] work of ministry, for [the] building up of the body - of christ,
105093 ^ until we may attain - all to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son - of god, unto a man a complete, to [the] measure of [the] stature of the fullness - of christ,
105119 ^ so that no longer we might be infants,
105123 ^ being tossed by waves
105124 ^ and being carried about by every wind - of teaching, in the cunning - of men in craftiness, with a view to the scheming - of deceit.
105331 ^ the [one] stealing, no longer let him steal;
105335 ^ rather however let him toil,
105338 ^ working with the own hands what [is] good,
105344 ^ so that he may have [something]
105346 ^ to impart
105347 ^ to the [one] need
105349 ^ having.
105350 ^ any word unwholesome out of the mouth of you not let go forth,
105359 ^ but if any good for edification of the need,
105367 ^ so that it may give grace
105370 ^ to those hearing.
105372 ^ and not grieve the spirit - holy - of god,
105381 ^ in whom you were sealed for [the] day of redemption.
105387 ^ all bitterness, and rage, and anger, and clamor, and slander, let be removed from you, along with all malice.
105403 ^ be now to one another kind, tender-hearted,
105409 ^ forgiving each other,
105411 ^ as also - god in christ forgave you.
105419 ^ be therefore imitators - of god, as children beloved,
105427 ^ and walk in love,
105431 ^ just as also - christ loved us
105437 ^ and gave up himself for us [as] an offering and a sacrifice - to god, into an aroma of a sweet smell.
105450 ^ sexual immorality however, and impurity all, or covetousness, not even let be named among you,
105461 ^ as also is proper to saints,
105464 ^ and filthiness, and foolish talking, or crude joking,
105470 ^ which not are fitting;
105473 ^ but rather thanksgiving.
105788 ^ the [one] loving the of himself wife, himself loves.
105795 ^ no one for at any time the of himself flesh hated,
105802 ^ but he nourishes
105804 ^ and cherishes it,
105807 ^ just as also [does] - christ the church;
105813 ^ for members we are
105816 ^ of the body of him.
105819 ^ because of this, will leave a man his father and - mother
105828 ^ and be joined to the wife of him,
105834 ^ and will be the two into flesh one.”
105841 ^ the mystery this great is;
105846 ^ i however speak as to christ, and as to the church.
105855 ^ however also you - according to individual,
105861 ^ each the of himself wife, so let love
105867 ^ as himself;
105869 ^ - and
105871 ^ the wife
105872 ^ that she may respect the husband.
105876 ^ - children, obey the parents of you in [the] lord;
105884 ^ this for is right.
105888 ^ honor the father of you and - mother,
105895 ^ which is [the] commandment first with a promise,
105901 ^ that well with you it may be,
105905 ^ and you will be long-lived upon the earth.”
105911 ^ and - fathers, not provoke the children of you,
105919 ^ but bring up them in [the] discipline and admonition of [the] lord.
105927 ^ - slaves, obey the according to flesh masters with fear and trembling, in sincerity of the heart of you,
105943 ^ as to christ,
105946 ^ not with eye-service as men-pleasers,
105951 ^ but as servants of christ,
105955 ^ doing the will - of god from [the] heart,
105962 ^ with good will rendering service,
105965 ^ as to the lord
105968 ^ and not to men,
105971 ^ knowing
105972 ^ that each one,
105974 ^ if whatever he might have done
105977 ^ good, this he will receive [back] from [the] lord,
105982 ^ whether slave
105984 ^ or free.
105986 ^ and - masters, the same things them do toward them,
105994 ^ giving up the threatening,
105997 ^ knowing
105998 ^ that also of them and of you the master is in [the] heavens,
106008 ^ and partiality not there is with him.
106014 ^ - henceforth be empowered in [the] lord, and in the strength of the might of him.
106026 ^ put on the complete armor - of god,
106031 ^ for - to be able you
106035 ^ to stand against the schemes of the devil,
106041 ^ because not is to us the wrestling against blood and flesh,
106051 ^ but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of the darkness this, against the spiritual [forces] - of evil in the heavenly realms.
106072 ^ because of this, take up the complete armor - of god,
106079 ^ so that you may be able
106081 ^ to withstand in the day - evil,
106087 ^ and
106088 ^ all things having done, to stand.
106091 ^ stand therefore,
106093 ^ having girded the loins of you with truth,
106099 ^ and having put on the breastplate - of righteousness,
106105 ^ and having shod the feet with [the] readiness of the gospel - of peace;
106602 ^ to me for - to live [is] christ,
106607 ^ and
106608 ^ - to die [is] gain.
106611 ^ if [i am] however
106613 ^ - to live in flesh,
106617 ^ this for me [is the] fruit of labor.
106621 ^ and
106622 ^ what shall i choose? not i know!
106626 ^ i am pressed however between the two,
106631 ^ the desire having
106634 ^ for [myself] - to depart
106637 ^ and with christ to be,
106641 ^ very much for
106643 ^ more better;
106645 ^ - but to remain in the flesh [is] more necessary for the sake of you.
106654 ^ and
106655 ^ this having been persuaded of, i know
106658 ^ that i will remain
106660 ^ and will continue with all of you for - your progress and joy of the faith,
106672 ^ so that the boasting of you may abound to christ jesus in me through - my coming again to you.
106689 ^ only worthily of the gospel - of christ conduct yourselves,
106696 ^ so that
106697 ^ whether having come
106699 ^ and having seen you,
106702 ^ or being absent, i might hear the things concerning you,
106708 ^ that you are standing firm in one spirit,
106713 ^ with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel,
106720 ^ and not being frightened in nothing
106725 ^ by those opposing [you],
106728 ^ which is to them a demonstration of destruction;
106733 ^ to you however
106735 ^ of salvation,
106736 ^ and this from god.
106740 ^ for to you it has been granted - concerning christ,
106746 ^ not only - in him
106751 ^ to believe,
106752 ^ but also - concerning him
106757 ^ to suffer,
106758 ^ the same conflict having,
106762 ^ such as you saw in me
106766 ^ and now hear of in me.
106771 ^ if [there is] any therefore
106774 ^ encouragement in christ,
106777 ^ if any comfort of love,
106781 ^ if any fellowship of [the] spirit,
106785 ^ if any affections and compassions,
106790 ^ fulfill my - joy
106794 ^ so that the same you may be minded,
106798 ^ the same love having,
106802 ^ united in soul,
106803 ^ the same thing minding,
106806 ^ nothing according to self-interest or according to vain conceit,
106812 ^ but - in humility one another be esteeming
107209 ^ the same things to write to you, to me indeed [is] not troublesome;
107217 ^ for you now [is] safe.
107220 ^ beware of the dogs;
107223 ^ beware of the evil workers;
107227 ^ beware of the false circumcision.
107230 ^ we for are the circumcision,
107235 ^ those in [the] spirit of god
107238 ^ worshiping
107239 ^ and glorying in christ jesus,
107244 ^ and not in [the] flesh having put confidence,
107249 ^ though i have confidence even in [the] flesh.
107256 ^ if any thinks
107259 ^ other
107260 ^ to have confidence in [the] flesh,
107263 ^ i more:
107265 ^ circumcision on [the] eighth day; of [the] nation of israel, of [the] tribe of benjamin; a hebrew of hebrews; according to [the] law, a pharisee;
107278 ^ according to zeal, persecuting the church;
107283 ^ according to righteousness
107285 ^ which [is] in [the] law,
107288 ^ having become faultless.
107290 ^ but whatever things were to me gain,
107295 ^ these i have esteemed, because of - christ,
107300 ^ loss.
107301 ^ but -, therefore indeed, also i count
107305 ^ all things loss to be
107308 ^ because of the excelling - knowledge of christ jesus the lord of me,
107318 ^ because of whom - all things i have lost,
107323 ^ and esteem [them] rubbish,
107326 ^ that christ i may gain
107329 ^ and be found in him,
107333 ^ not having my own righteousness, which [is] of [the] law,
107340 ^ but that through faith from christ, the of god righteousness
107349 ^ on the basis of - faith,
107352 ^ - to know him and the power of the resurrection of him, and the fellowship of sufferings of him,
107367 ^ being conformed to the death of him,
107371 ^ if, by any means, i may attain to the resurrection - out from dead.
107380 ^ not that already i have obtained [it],
107384 ^ or already have been perfected;
107387 ^ i am pursuing however,
107389 ^ if also i may lay hold
107392 ^ of that for which also i was laid hold of by christ jesus.
107399 ^ brothers, i
107401 ^ myself not do consider to have taken hold [of it].
107405 ^ one thing however:
107407 ^ the things indeed
107409 ^ behind forgetting,
107411 ^ to the things now
107413 ^ ahead reaching forward, toward [the] goal i press on for the prize of the upward calling - of god in christ jesus.
107429 ^ as many as therefore [are] mature,
107432 ^ this should be of mind;
107434 ^ and if [in] anything differently you are minded,
107439 ^ even this - god to you will reveal.
107445 ^ nevertheless to that which we have attained,
107449 ^ by the same to walk.
107452 ^ imitators together of me be, brothers,
107456 ^ and observe
107458 ^ those thus
107460 ^ walking,
107461 ^ as you have [for] a pattern us.
107465 ^ many for are walking —
107468 ^ [of] whom often i told you,
107472 ^ now indeed
107474 ^ even weeping i say —
107477 ^ - [as] enemies of the cross - of christ,
107483 ^ whose - end [is] destruction,
107487 ^ whose - god [is] the belly,
107492 ^ and - glory [is] in the shame of them,
109185 ^ the [one] for doing wrong will be repaid [for]
109189 ^ what he has done wrong,
109191 ^ and not there is partiality.
109195 ^ - masters, that which [is] righteous and that which [is] equal, to the slaves give,
109205 ^ knowing
109206 ^ that also you have a master in heaven.
109213 ^ - in prayer continue steadfastly,
109216 ^ watching in it with thanksgiving,
109221 ^ praying at the same time also for us,
109226 ^ that - god may open to us a door for the word,
109234 ^ to declare the mystery - of christ,
109239 ^ on account of which also i have been bound,
109243 ^ so that i should make clear it,
109246 ^ as it behooves
109248 ^ me to speak.
109250 ^ in wisdom walk toward those outside,
109256 ^ the time redeeming.
109259 ^ - [let the] speech of you [be] always in grace,
109265 ^ with salt having been seasoned,

109268 ^ how it behooves
109270 ^ you one each to answer.
109274 ^ the things concerning me all will make known to you tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant and fellow bond-servant in [the] lord,

109298 ^ that you might know the things concerning us,
109303 ^ and he may encourage the hearts of you, with onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother,
109315 ^ who is [one] of you.
109319 ^ all things to you they will make known
109322 ^ - here.

109541 ^ knowing, brothers
109543 ^ beloved by - god, the election of you,
109550 ^ because the gospel of us not came to you in word only,

110729 ^ those for
110731 ^ sleeping, by night sleep;

110735 ^ those becoming drunk, by night get drunk.
110739 ^ we however,

110744 ^ having put on [the] breastplate of faith and love, and [the] helmet [the] hope of salvation,
110753 ^ because not has destined us - god for wrath,
110761 ^ but for obtaining salvation through the lord of us jesus christ,
110771 ^ the [one] having died for us,

116384 ^ if indeed from the beginning the assurance unto [the] end firm we should hold.
116393 ^ as - it is said:
116396 ^ today if the voice of him you should hear,
116402 ^ not harden the hearts of you,
116407 ^ as in the rebellion.”
116411 ^ who for
116413 ^ [were those] having heard, rebelled,
116415 ^ but not
116417 ^ all those having come out of egypt by the leading of moses?
116424 ^ with whom now was he indignant forty years,
116429 ^ [if] not
116430 ^ with those having sinned,
116432 ^ whose - bodies fell in the wilderness?
116439 ^ to whom then did he swear that
116442 ^ not shall they enter into the rest of him,
116448 ^ if not
116450 ^ to those having disobeyed?
116452 ^ and we see
116454 ^ that not they were able
116457 ^ to enter in because of unbelief.
116460 ^ we should fear therefore,
116462 ^ lest ever
116463 ^ left remaining, of the promise
116465 ^ to enter into the rest of him, should seem any of you
116474 ^ to have fallen short.
116475 ^ and for we are [those]
116478 ^ having had the gospel preached
116479 ^ just as they [did];
116481 ^ but not did profit the message of [their] hearing them,
116489 ^ not having been united with the faith
116493 ^ of those having heard.
116495 ^ we enter for into the rest,
116500 ^ those having believed;
116502 ^ as he has said:
116504 ^ so i swore in the wrath of me,
116510 ^ not shall they enter into the rest of me.’”
116516 ^ and yet the works from [the] foundation of [the] world have been finished.
116523 ^ he has spoken for somewhere concerning the seventh [day]

116544 ^ and in this [passage] again,
116548 ^ [not] shall they enter into the rest of me.
116554 ^ since therefore it remains [for]
116557 ^ some to enter into it,
116561 ^ and
116562 ^ those formerly

116574 ^ through david saying after so long a time,
116580 ^ just as it has been said,
116582 ^ today, if the voice of him you shall hear,

116593 ^ if for to them joshua had given rest,
116598 ^ not - about another he would have spoken after this day.
116606 ^ so then there remains a sabbath rest for the people - of god.
116952 ^ everyone for - partaking [only] of milk [is] inexperienced in [the] word of righteousness;
116960 ^ an infant for he is;
116963 ^ [for the] mature however is - solid food,
116969 ^ the [ones] by - constant use the senses
116975 ^ training
116976 ^ having
117392 ^ the [one] however not tracing his ancestry from them has collected a tenth from abraham,
117400 ^ and
117401 ^ the [one] having the promises has blessed.
117406 ^ apart from now
117408 ^ all dispute, the inferior by the superior is blessed.
117416 ^ and here indeed tithes,
117420 ^ dying men receive;
117423 ^ in that place however,
117425 ^ it is testified
117426 ^ that he lives on.
117428 ^ and
117429 ^ so, a word
117431 ^ to speak, through abraham also, levi,
117436 ^ the [one] tithes
117438 ^ receiving, paid the tithe.
117440 ^ still for in the loin of [his] father he was,
117448 ^ when met him melchizedek.
117452 ^ if indeed then perfection by the levitical priesthood were —
117461 ^ the people for upon it had received [the] law —
117467 ^ what still need [was there],
117470 ^ according to the order of melchizedek, [for] another to arise
117476 ^ priest
117477 ^ and not according to the order of aaron to be named?
117484 ^ being changed for of the priesthood,
117488 ^ from necessity also, of law a change takes place.
117494 ^ [he] concerning whom for are said these things a tribe another belonged to,
117502 ^ from which no one has served at the altar.
117508 ^ [it is] evident for
117510 ^ that out of judah has sprung the lord of us,
117517 ^ as to which a tribe, concerning priests, nothing moses spoke.
117525 ^ and more abundantly yet evident it is,
117530 ^ if according to the likeness of melchizedek arises a priest another,
117538 ^ who not according to a law of a commandment fleshly has been constituted,
117545 ^ but according to [the] power of a life indestructible.
117550 ^ it is testified for
117552 ^ -: you [are] a priest to the age, according to the order of melchizedek.”
117562 ^ a putting away indeed for there is
117566 ^ of the preceding commandment, because of - its weakness and uselessness —
117574 ^ nothing for perfected the law —
117579 ^ [the] introduction then
117581 ^ of a better hope,
117583 ^ by which we draw near - to god.
117588 ^ and to as much as not apart from an oath,
117594 ^ those ones truly for
117597 ^ without an oath are priests becoming,
117602 ^ [he] however with an oath,
117606 ^ through the [one] saying to him:
117611 ^ has sworn [the] lord,
117613 ^ and not will change his mind,
117616 ^ you [are] a priest to the age.’”
117621 ^ by so much also of a better covenant has become
117627 ^ [the] guarantee jesus.
117629 ^ and those indeed many are
117634 ^ having become priests,
117636 ^ because of - by death
117639 ^ being prevented from
117640 ^ continuing.
117641 ^ - but
117643 ^ because of the abiding of him to the age, a permanent he holds - priesthood,
117654 ^ wherefore also,
117656 ^ to save to the uttermost he is able,
118309 ^ [the] death [it is] necessary to establish
118312 ^ of the [one] having made [it].
118314 ^ a will for after death [is] affirmed,

118324 ^ the [one] having made [it],
118326 ^ wherefore neither the first, apart from blood has been inaugurated.

119164 ^ the one drawing near - to god,
119168 ^ that he exists,
119170 ^ and [that]

119176 ^ by faith
119177 ^ having been divinely instructed noah
119326 ^ those for such things saying make manifest
119331 ^ that [their] own country they are seeking.

120026 ^ which those having heard excused themselves,
120030 ^ [asking] not to be addressed to them [the] word,
120034 ^ not they could bear for
120037 ^ that being commanded:
120039 ^ if even a beast should touch the mountain,
120044 ^ it shall be stoned.”

120754 ^ by the own desire being drawn away
120759 ^ and being enticed.
120761 ^ then - desire,
120764 ^ having conceived, gives birth to sin;
120767 ^ - and
120769 ^ sin
120770 ^ having become fully grown, brings forth death.
120773 ^ not be misled, brothers my beloved.
120778 ^ every act of giving good, and every gift perfect,
120785 ^ from above is, coming down from the father - of lights,
120793 ^ with whom not there is variation or of shifting shadow.
121128 ^ the [one] for having said,
121131 ^ not you shall commit adultery,” said also,
121135 ^ not you shall murder.”
121137 ^ if however not you do commit adultery,
121141 ^ do commit murder however,
121143 ^ you have become a transgressor of [the] law.
121146 ^ so speak
121148 ^ and so act
121151 ^ as
121152 ^ by [the] law of freedom
121155 ^ being about
121156 ^ to be judged.
121157 ^ - for
121159 ^ judgment without mercy [will be]
121161 ^ to the [one] not
121163 ^ having shown mercy.
121165 ^ triumphs over mercy judgment.
121168 ^ what [is] the profit, brothers of me,
121173 ^ if
121174 ^ faith says anyone
121177 ^ to have,
121178 ^ works however not he has?
121182 ^ not is able the faith
121186 ^ to save him?
121188 ^ now if a brother or a sister without clothes is,
121194 ^ and
121195 ^ lacking is - of daily food,
121200 ^ says then anyone to them
121204 ^ out from you,
121206 ^ go in peace;
121209 ^ be warmed
121210 ^ and be filled,
121212 ^ not gives however to them the needful things for the body,
121220 ^ what [is] the profit?
121223 ^ so also - faith,
121227 ^ if not it has works, dead is, by itself.
121235 ^ but will say someone,
121238 ^ you faith have,
121241 ^ and i works have.
121244 ^ show me the faith of you without - works,
121252 ^ and i you will show by the works of me, - faith.
121261 ^ you believe
121263 ^ that one is - god.
121268 ^ well you are doing!
121270 ^ even the demons believe [that],
121274 ^ and shudder!
121276 ^ do you want however
121278 ^ to come to know, o man foolish,
121282 ^ that - faith apart from - works worthless is?
121290 ^ abraham the father of us, not by works was justified,
121298 ^ having offered isaac the son of him upon the altar?
121306 ^ you see
121307 ^ that [his] faith was working with the works of him,
121314 ^ and by [his] works, [his] faith was perfected.
121321 ^ and was fulfilled the scripture
121325 ^ - saying,
121327 ^ believed then abraham - god,
121332 ^ and it was counted to him for righteousness,”
121337 ^ and a friend of god he was called.
121341 ^ you see
121342 ^ that by works is justified a man,
121347 ^ and not by faith alone.
121352 ^ likewise then also rahab the prostitute not by works was justified,
121362 ^ having received the messengers
121365 ^ and by another way having sent [them] forth?
121369 ^ just as for the body apart from spirit dead is,
121377 ^ so also - faith apart from works dead is.
121385 ^ not many [of you] teachers let be, brothers of mine,
121391 ^ knowing
121392 ^ that greater judgment we will receive.
121396 ^ in many ways for we stumble all.
121400 ^ if anyone in what he says not does stumble,
121406 ^ this one [is] a perfect man, able
121410 ^ to bridle indeed all the body.
121415 ^ if now, of the horses - bits
121421 ^ into the mouths we put
121425 ^ for - to obey them us,
121430 ^ even all the body of them we turn about.
121436 ^ behold,
121437 ^ also the ships,
121440 ^ so great being
121442 ^ and by winds strong being driven, are turned about by a very small rudder
121451 ^ wherever the impulse
121454 ^ of the [one] steering resolves.
121457 ^ thus also the tongue a small member is,
121464 ^ and exceeding things it boasts.
121467 ^ behold
121468 ^ a small fire, how great a forest it kindles.
121473 ^ also the tongue [is] a fire,
121477 ^ the world - of iniquity. the tongue is set among the members of us,
121488 ^ - defiling all the body,
121493 ^ and setting on fire the course - of nature,
121499 ^ and [itself] being set on fire by - hell.
121504 ^ all for
121506 ^ kinds of beasts both and of birds, of creeping things both and things of the sea, is subdued

121524 ^ the tongue no one
121526 ^ to subdue is able
121528 ^ of men;
121529 ^ [it is] an unruly evil, full of poison deadly.
121534 ^ with it we bless our lord and father,
121541 ^ and with it we curse - men,
121547 ^ those according to [the] likeness of god
121551 ^ being made.

121560 ^ not ought, brothers of me,

122609 ^ having been foreknown indeed before [the] foundation of [the] world,

124947 ^ expecting
124948 ^ and hastening the coming of the - of god day,

125046 ^ you therefore, beloved,
125049 ^ knowing [this] beforehand, beware,
125051 ^ that not
125053 ^ by the of the lawless error having been led away, you should fall from the own steadfastness.
125062 ^ grow however in grace, and in knowledge of the lord of us and savior jesus christ.
125075 ^ to him [be] the glory both now and to [the] day of eternity.
125084 ^ that which was from [the] beginning,
125088 ^ that which we have heard,
125090 ^ that which we have seen with the eyes of us,
125095 ^ that which we have gazed upon
125097 ^ and the hands of us have handled,
125102 ^ concerning the word - of life —
125107 ^ and the life was made manifest,
125111 ^ and we have seen
125113 ^ and bear witness,
125115 ^ and we proclaim to you the life - eternal
125122 ^ which was with the father
125127 ^ and was revealed to us —
125130 ^ that which we have seen
125132 ^ and have heard, we proclaim also to you,
125137 ^ so that also you fellowship may have with us.
125144 ^ indeed the fellowship now
125148 ^ - of us [is] with the father, and with the son of him, jesus christ.
125160 ^ and these things write we
125164 ^ so that the joy of us might be
125169 ^ complete.
125170 ^ and is this the message
125175 ^ that we have heard from him,
125179 ^ and we preach to you,
125182 ^ that - god light is,
125187 ^ and darkness in him, not is none.
125194 ^ if we should say
125196 ^ that fellowship we have with him,
125201 ^ and yet in the darkness should walk,
125206 ^ we lie
125207 ^ and not do practice the truth.
125212 ^ if in the light we should walk
125217 ^ as he is in the light,
125223 ^ fellowship we have with one another,
125227 ^ and the blood of jesus, the son of him, cleanses us from all sin.
125239 ^ if we should say
125241 ^ that sin not we have,
125245 ^ ourselves we deceive,
125247 ^ and the truth not is in us.
125254 ^ if we should confess the sins of us,
125259 ^ faithful he is
125261 ^ and just,
125263 ^ that he may forgive us [our] sins,
125268 ^ and might cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
125274 ^ if we should say
125276 ^ that not we have sinned,
125279 ^ a liar we make him,
125282 ^ and the word of him not is in us.
125290 ^ little children of me, these things i am writing to you
125295 ^ so that not you might sin.
125298 ^ and if anyone should sin,
125302 ^ an advocate we have with the father,
125307 ^ jesus christ [the] righteous [one].
125310 ^ and he [the] propitiation is for the sins of us;
125318 ^ not for the of ours and only,
125324 ^ but also for all the world.
125330 ^ and by this we know
125334 ^ that we have come to know him,
125337 ^ if the commandments of him we should keep.
125342 ^ the [one] saying
125344 ^ -, i have known him,
125347 ^ and the commandments of him not keeping, a liar he is,
125355 ^ and in him the truth not is.
125362 ^ whoever however - may keep his - word,
125369 ^ truly in him the love - of god has been perfected.
125377 ^ by this we know
125380 ^ that in him we are:
125384 ^ the [one] claiming in him
125388 ^ to abide, ought
125390 ^ just as that walk also he
125395 ^ in the same way walked.
125397 ^ beloved, not a commandment new i am writing to you,
125403 ^ but a commandment old,
125406 ^ which you have had from [the] beginning.
125410 ^ the commandment - old is the word
125417 ^ that you have heard.
125419 ^ again, a commandment new i am writing to you,
125424 ^ which is true in him and in you,
125432 ^ because the darkness is passing away,
125436 ^ and the light - true already shines.
125443 ^ the [one] claiming
125445 ^ in the light to be
125449 ^ and the brother of him hating, in the darkness is even until now.
125460 ^ the [one] loving the brother of him, in the light abides,
125469 ^ and cause for stumbling in him not there is.
125475 ^ the [one] however
125477 ^ hating the brother of him, in the darkness is,
125485 ^ and in the darkness walks;
125490 ^ and not does he know
125493 ^ where he is going,
125495 ^ because the darkness has blinded the eyes of him.
125502 ^ i am writing to you, little children,
125505 ^ because have been forgiven your - sins for the sake of the name of him.
125514 ^ i am writing to you, fathers,
125517 ^ because you have known him who [is] from [the] beginning.
125522 ^ i am writing to you, young men,
125525 ^ because you have overcome the evil [one].
125529 ^ i have written to you, little children,
125532 ^ because you know the father.
125536 ^ i have written to you, fathers,
125539 ^ because you know him who [is] from [the] beginning.
125544 ^ i have written to you, young men,
125547 ^ because strong you are,
125550 ^ and the word - of god in you abides,
125558 ^ and you have overcome the evil [one].
125562 ^ not love the world
125566 ^ nor the things in the world.
125571 ^ if anyone should love the world,
125576 ^ not is the love of the father in him,
125584 ^ because all that [is] in the world, the desire of the flesh, and the desire of the eyes, and the vaunting of life, not is from the father,
125609 ^ but from the world is.
125614 ^ and the world is passing away,
125618 ^ and the desire of it;
125622 ^ the [one] however
125624 ^ doing the will - of god abides to the age.
125633 ^ little children, [the] last hour it is,
125637 ^ and as you have heard
125640 ^ that antichrist is coming,
125643 ^ even now antichrists many have arisen,
125648 ^ whereby we know
125650 ^ that [the] last hour it is.
125654 ^ from among us they went out,
125657 ^ but not they were of us;
125662 ^ if for of us they had been,
125667 ^ they would have remained - with us.
125671 ^ but [it is] so that it might be made manifest
125674 ^ that not they are all of us.
125680 ^ and you [the] anointing have from the holy [one],
125687 ^ and know you all.
125690 ^ not i have written to you
125693 ^ because not you know the truth,
125698 ^ but because you know it,
125702 ^ and because any lie, of the truth not is.
125711 ^ who is the liar,
125715 ^ if not
125717 ^ the [one] denying
125719 ^ that jesus not is the christ?
125725 ^ this is the antichrist,
125729 ^ the [one] denying the father and the son.
125736 ^ everyone
125737 ^ - denying the son, neither the father has he.
125745 ^ the [one] confessing the son, also the father has.
125753 ^ you,
125754 ^ what you have heard from [the] beginning, in you let it abide.
125761 ^ if in you should abide
125765 ^ what from [the] beginning you have heard,
125769 ^ also you in the son and in the father will abide.
125779 ^ and this is the promise
125784 ^ that he promised us:
125788 ^ - life - eternal.
125792 ^ these things i have written to you
125795 ^ concerning those leading astray you.
125799 ^ and you,
125801 ^ the anointing
125803 ^ that you received from him, abides in you,
125810 ^ and not need you have
125814 ^ that anyone should teach you.
125818 ^ but just as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things,
125827 ^ and true is,
125830 ^ and not is a lie;
125834 ^ and just as it has taught you,
125838 ^ you shall abide in him.
125841 ^ and now, little children, abide in him,
125847 ^ so that when he appears
125850 ^ we might have boldness
125852 ^ and not be ashamed before him at the coming of him.
125861 ^ if you know
125863 ^ that righteous he is,
125866 ^ you know
125867 ^ that also everyone
125870 ^ - practicing - righteousness, of him has been begotten.
125877 ^ behold
125878 ^ what love has given to us the father,
125884 ^ that children of god we should be called —
125888 ^ and we are!
125890 ^ because of this, the world not knows us,
125897 ^ because not it knew him.
125901 ^ beloved, now children of god are we,
125906 ^ and not yet has been revealed
125909 ^ what we will be.
125911 ^ we know
125912 ^ that when he appears,
125915 ^ like him we will be,
125918 ^ for we will see him
125921 ^ as he is.
125923 ^ and everyone
125925 ^ - having the hope this in him, purifies himself,
125934 ^ just as he pure is.
125938 ^ everyone - committing - sin, also - lawlessness commits;
125947 ^ and - sin is - lawlessness.
125953 ^ and you know
125955 ^ that he appeared
125958 ^ so that - sins he might take away;
125962 ^ and sin in him not there is.
125968 ^ anyone - in him
125972 ^ abiding, not sins;
125975 ^ anyone - sinning, not has seen him,
125981 ^ nor has he known him.
125984 ^ little children, no one let lead astray you;
125988 ^ the [one] practicing - righteousness, righteous is,
125994 ^ just as he righteous is.
125998 ^ the [one] practicing - sin, of the devil is,
126006 ^ because from [the] beginning the devil has been sinning.

126025 ^ anyone - having been born of - god, sin not practices,
126034 ^ because seed of him in him abides,

126116 ^ of the brother of him, righteous.
126120 ^ and not be surprised, brothers,
126124 ^ if hates you the world.
126129 ^ we know

126150 ^ everyone - hating the brother of him a murderer is;
126158 ^ and you know
126160 ^ that any murderer, not has life eternal
126167 ^ in him abiding.
126170 ^ by this we have known - love,
126175 ^ because he for us the life of him laid down;
126183 ^ and we ought for [our] brothers,
126189 ^ [our] lives to lay down.
126192 ^ whoever now - might have the goods of the world,
126200 ^ and might see the brother of him

126207 ^ and might close up the heart of him from him,
126214 ^ how the love - of god abides in him?
126222 ^ little children, not we should love in word, nor in tongue,
126229 ^ but in action and in truth.
126234 ^ and by this we will know
126238 ^ that of the truth we are,
126243 ^ and before him we will assure the heart of us,
126250 ^ that if should condemn [us] our - heart,
126256 ^ that greater than is - god
126261 ^ the heart of us,
126264 ^ and he knows all things.
126267 ^ beloved, if the heart of us not should condemn [us],
126274 ^ confidence we have toward - god,
126279 ^ and
126280 ^ whatever if we might ask, we receive from him,
126286 ^ because the commandments of him we keep,
126291 ^ and the things pleasing before him we do.
126297 ^ and this is the commandment of him,
126303 ^ that we should believe in the name the son of him, jesus christ,
126312 ^ and we should love one another,
126315 ^ just as he gave [the] commandment to us.

126346 ^ beloved, not every spirit believe,
126351 ^ but test the spirits,
126355 ^ whether of - god they are,
126360 ^ because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
126367 ^ by this you know the spirit - of god:
126374 ^ every spirit
126376 ^ that confesses jesus christ
126380 ^ in [the] flesh having come, of - god is;
126387 ^ and any spirit

126410 ^ and now in the world is already.
126417 ^ you from - god are, little children,

126437 ^ they of the world are;
126442 ^ because of this from out of the world they speak,
126448 ^ and the world them listens to.
126453 ^ we of - god are.
126458 ^ the [one] knowing - god listens to us.
126464 ^ he who not is from - god, not listens to us.
126473 ^ by this we know the spirit - of truth and the spirit - of falsehood.
126485 ^ beloved, we should love one another,
126488 ^ because - love from - god is;
126495 ^ and
126496 ^ everyone - loving, from - god has been born,
126503 ^ and knows - god.
126507 ^ the [one] not

126528 ^ that the son of him, the one and only, has sent - god into the world,
126540 ^ so that we might live through him.
126544 ^ in this is - love,
126549 ^ not that we loved - god,
126555 ^ but that he loved us
126560 ^ and sent the son of him [as] a propitiation for the sins of us.
126570 ^ beloved, if so - god loved us,
126577 ^ also we ought
126580 ^ one another to love.
126582 ^ god no one at any time has seen;
126586 ^ if we should love one another,
126589 ^ - god in us abides
126594 ^ and the love of him in us
126600 ^ having been perfected is.
126602 ^ by this we know
126605 ^ that in him we abide,
126609 ^ and he in us,
126613 ^ because from out the spirit of him he has given to us.
126620 ^ and we have seen
126623 ^ and testify
126625 ^ that the father has sent the son [as] savior of the world.
126634 ^ whoever if shall confess
126637 ^ that jesus is the son - of god,
126644 ^ - god in him abides,
126649 ^ and he in - god.
126654 ^ and we have come to know
126657 ^ and have come to believe the love
126661 ^ that has - god as to us.
126667 ^ - god love is,
126671 ^ and
126672 ^ the [one] abiding in - love, in - god abides,
126681 ^ and - god in him abides.
126687 ^ in this has been perfected - love with us,
126694 ^ so that confidence we may have in the day - of judgment,
126702 ^ that just as he is,
126706 ^ also we are in the world this.
126713 ^ fear no there is in - love,
126719 ^ but - perfect love out casts - fear,
126727 ^ because the fear punishment has;
126732 ^ the [one] now fearing, not has been perfected in - love.
126740 ^ we love
126742 ^ because he first loved us.
126747 ^ if anyone should say
126750 ^ -, i love - god,
126754 ^ and the brother of him should hate,
126759 ^ a liar he is.
126761 ^ the [one] for not loving the brother of him,
126768 ^ whom he has seen,
126770 ^ - god,
126772 ^ whom not he has seen, not is he able
126777 ^ to love.
126778 ^ and this the commandment we have from him,
126785 ^ that
126786 ^ the [one] loving - god should love also the brother of him.
126795 ^ everyone - believing
126798 ^ that jesus is the christ, of - god has been born,
126807 ^ and
126808 ^ everyone - loving
126811 ^ the [one] having begotten [him], loves also
126815 ^ the [one] having been begotten from him.
126819 ^ by this we know
126822 ^ that we love the children - of god,
126828 ^ when - god we love
126832 ^ and the commandments of him keep.
126837 ^ this for is the love - of god,
126844 ^ that the commandments of him we should keep;
126849 ^ and the commandments of him burdensome not are.
126856 ^ for
126857 ^ everyone - having been born of - god overcomes the world;
126866 ^ and this is the victory
126871 ^ - having overcome the world:
126875 ^ the faith of us.
126878 ^ who now is
126881 ^ the [one] overcoming the world,
126885 ^ if not
126887 ^ the [one] believing
126889 ^ that jesus is the son - of god?
126896 ^ this is
126898 ^ the [one] having come by water and blood, jesus christ;
126906 ^ not by - water only,
126911 ^ but by - water and by - blood.
126919 ^ and the spirit is
126923 ^ the [one] testifying,

126931 ^ for three there are
126934 ^ - bearing testimony:
126936 ^ the spirit and the water and the blood —
126944 ^ and these three in - one are.
126951 ^ if the testimony - of men we receive,
126957 ^ the testimony - of god greater is.
126963 ^ for this is the testimony - of god
126970 ^ that he has testified concerning the son of him.
126976 ^ the [one] believing in the son - of god has the testimony in himself.
126988 ^ the [one] not
126990 ^ believing - god, a liar has made him,
126996 ^ because not he has believed in the testimony
127002 ^ that has testified - god concerning the son him.
127010 ^ and this is the testimony,
127015 ^ that life eternal has given to us, - god

129834 ^ and on the thrones twenty four elders
129841 ^ sitting,
133470 ^ he by [the] sword [is] to be killed.”
133474 ^ here is the endurance and the faith of the saints.
133483 ^ and i saw another beast
133487 ^ rising out of the earth,
133491 ^ and it had horns two like a lamb,
133497 ^ and it was speaking like a dragon.
133501 ^ and the authority of the first beast all it exercises on behalf of it,
133511 ^ and causes the earth and
133516 ^ those in it
133519 ^ dwelling,
133520 ^ that they will worship the beast - first,
133526 ^ of whom had been healed the wound - fatal of it.
133533 ^ and it works signs great,
133537 ^ so that even fire it should cause
133541 ^ out of - heaven to come down to the earth in the presence - of men.
133551 ^ and it deceives
133553 ^ those dwelling on the earth, by reason of the signs
133561 ^ that were given to it to perform before the beast,
133568 ^ telling
133569 ^ those dwelling on the earth
133574 ^ to make an image to the beast
133578 ^ that has the wound of the sword
133584 ^ and has lived.
133586 ^ and there was given to it
133589 ^ to give breath to the image of the beast,
133595 ^ so that also should speak the image of the beast,
133602 ^ and should cause
133604 ^ that
133605 ^ as many as if not would worship the image of the beast would be killed.
133614 ^ and it causes all the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the servants,
133634 ^ that it should give them a mark on the hand of them - right, or on the forehead of them,
133649 ^ and that no one should be able
133654 ^ to buy
133655 ^ or to sell,
133657 ^ if not
133659 ^ the [one] having the mark — the name of the beast, or the number of the name of it.
133673 ^ here the wisdom is.
133677 ^ the [one] having understanding, let him count the number of the beast;
133685 ^ number for
133687 ^ a man’s it is,
133689 ^ and the number [is] of it, six hundred sixty six.
133696 ^ and i looked,
133698 ^ and behold,
133700 ^ the lamb
133702 ^ was standing upon - mount zion,
133707 ^ and with him one hundred forty four thousand,
133714 ^ having the name of him and the name of the father of him
133724 ^ having been written on the foreheads of them.
133729 ^ and i heard a voice out of - heaven, as [the] sound of waters many, and as [the] sound of thunder loud.
133744 ^ and the voice
133747 ^ that i heard, [was] like that of harpists
133751 ^ harping with the harps of them.
133756 ^ and they are singing as a song new before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders.
133772 ^ and no one was able
133775 ^ to learn the song,
133778 ^ if not the one hundred forty four thousand
133785 ^ - having been redeemed from the earth.
133790 ^ these are
133792 ^ they who with women not
133796 ^ have not been defiled;
133797 ^ pure for they are,
133800 ^ these
133801 ^ - following the lamb
133805 ^ wherever - he shall go.
133808 ^ these have been redeemed out from - men [as] firstfruits - to god and to the lamb.
133819 ^ and in the mouth of them not was found a lie;
133827 ^ blameless they are.
133829 ^ and i saw another angel
133833 ^ flying in mid-heaven,
133836 ^ having [the] glad tidings everlasting
133839 ^ to preach
133840 ^ upon those dwelling on the earth, and upon every nation and tribe and tongue and people,
133856 ^ saying in a voice loud,
133860 ^ fear - god,
133863 ^ and give him glory,
133867 ^ because has come the hour of the judgment of him.
133874 ^ and worship
133876 ^ the [one] having made - heaven, and the earth, and sea, and springs of waters.
133888 ^ and another angel, a second followed,
133893 ^ saying,
133894 ^ fallen,
133895 ^ fallen is babylon the great,
133899 ^ who of the wine - of wrath for the immorality of her, she has given to drink all the gentiles.
133912 ^ and another angel, a third, followed them,
133918 ^ saying in a voice loud,
133922 ^ if anyone worships the beast and the image of it,
133931 ^ and receives a mark on the forehead of him, or upon the hand of him,
133943 ^ also he will drink of the wine of the anger - of god,
133953 ^ - having been mixed undiluted in the cup of the wrath of him;
133962 ^ and he will be tormented in fire and brimstone, before [the] angels holy, and before the lamb.
133975 ^ and the smoke of the torment of them to ages of ages goes up;
133985 ^ and not have rest day and night
133992 ^ those worshiping the beast and the image of it,
134000 ^ and if anyone receives the mark of the name of it.
134009 ^ here the endurance of the saints is,
134015 ^ those keeping the commandments - of god, and the faith of jesus.
134025 ^ and i heard a voice
134028 ^ out of - heaven, saying
134032 ^ write,
134033 ^ blessed [are] the dead
134036 ^ - in the lord
134039 ^ dying from now on.
134042 ^ yes,
134043 ^ says the spirit,
134046 ^ so that they will rest from the labors of them;
134052 ^ - for
134054 ^ the works of them follow with them.
134059 ^ and i looked,
134061 ^ and behold,
134063 ^ a cloud white,
134065 ^ and
134066 ^ upon the cloud is sitting [one] like [the] son of man,
134073 ^ having on the head of him a crown golden,
134080 ^ and in the hand of him a sickle sharp.
134087 ^ and another angel came out of the temple,
134094 ^ crying in a voice loud
134098 ^ to the [one] sitting on the cloud,
134103 ^ put forth the sickle of you
134107 ^ and reap,
134109 ^ because has come the hour
134113 ^ to reap,
134114 ^ because has ripened the harvest of the earth.
134120 ^ and swung
134122 ^ the [one] sitting upon the cloud the sickle of him upon the earth,
134133 ^ and was harvested the earth.
134137 ^ and another angel came out of the temple - in - heaven,
134148 ^ having also he a sickle sharp.
134153 ^ and another angel came out of the altar,
135192 ^ a little while him it behooves to remain.
135196 ^ and the beast
135199 ^ which was,
135201 ^ and not is, also
135205 ^ himself an eighth is,
135208 ^ and of the seven is,
135213 ^ and into destruction goes.
135217 ^ and the ten horns
135221 ^ which you saw, ten kings are,
135226 ^ who a kingdom not yet have received,
135230 ^ but authority as kings one hour receive, along with the beast.
135240 ^ these one mind have,
135244 ^ and the power and authority of themselves, to the beast they shall give up.
135253 ^ these with the lamb war will make,
135258 ^ and the lamb will overcome them,
135263 ^ because lord of lords he is,
135267 ^ and king of kings;
135270 ^ and those with him [are] called and chosen and faithful.
135279 ^ and he says to me,
135282 ^ the waters
135284 ^ that you saw,
135286 ^ where the prostitute sits, peoples and multitudes are,
135294 ^ and nations and tongues.
135298 ^ and the ten horns
135302 ^ that you saw, and the beast,
135307 ^ these will hate the prostitute,
135311 ^ and
135312 ^ desolate will make her,
135315 ^ and naked;
135317 ^ and the flesh of her they will eat,
135322 ^ and her they will burn with fire.
135327 ^ - for
135329 ^ god has put into the hearts of them
135335 ^ to do the purpose of him,
135339 ^ and to do one purpose,
135343 ^ and to give the kingdom of them to the beast,
135350 ^ until will be fulfilled the words - of god.
135356 ^ and the woman
135359 ^ whom you saw is the city - great,
135366 ^ - having kingship over the kings of the earth.
135374 ^ after these things i saw another angel
135379 ^ descending out of - heaven,
135383 ^ having authority great;
135386 ^ and the earth was illuminated from the glory of him.
135394 ^ and he cried out in a mighty voice,
135399 ^ saying:
135400 ^ fallen,
135401 ^ fallen is babylon the great!
135405 ^ and she has become a habitation of demons, and a prison of every spirit unclean, and a prison of every bird unclean, and a prison of every creature unclean
135424 ^ and having been hated.
135426 ^ for of the wine of the wrath of the sexual immorality of her, have drunk all the nations;
135439 ^ and the kings of the earth with her have committed sexual immorality;
135447 ^ and the merchants of the earth through the power of the sensuality of her have been enriched.
135459 ^ and i heard another voice
135463 ^ from - heaven, saying:
135467 ^ come the people of me, out of her,
135473 ^ so that not you may have fellowship in the sins of her,
135479 ^ and of the plagues of her so that not you may receive.
135487 ^ for have been heaped her - sins as high as - heaven,
135495 ^ and has remembered - god the iniquities of her.
135502 ^ give back to her
135504 ^ as also she has rendered;
135508 ^ and pay back double to her, twofold according to the works of her.
135516 ^ in the cup
135519 ^ which she has mixed, mix to her double.
135524 ^ so much as she has glorified herself
135527 ^ and lived in luxury,
135529 ^ as much give to her torment and misery,
135535 ^ because in the heart of herself she says
135541 ^ -, i sit [as] a queen,
135544 ^ and a widow never i am,
135548 ^ and mourning never not shall i see.
135553 ^ because of this, in one day will come the plagues of her, death and misery and famine;
135567 ^ and with fire she will be burned up,
135571 ^ because mighty [is the] lord - god,
135576 ^ the [one] having judged her.
135579 ^ and will weep
135581 ^ and will wail for her the kings of the earth,
135589 ^ the [ones] with her
135592 ^ having committed sexual immorality
135593 ^ and having lived luxuriously,
135595 ^ when they see the smoke of the burning of her,
135602 ^ from afar standing because of the fear of the torment of her,
135611 ^ saying:
135612 ^ woe, woe, the city - great, babylon, the city - strong!
135623 ^ for [in] one hour has come the judgment of you.
135630 ^ and the merchants of the earth weep
135636 ^ and mourn for her,
135640 ^ because the cargo of them, no one buys no longer —
135647 ^ cargo of gold, and of silver, and of stone precious, and of pearls; and of fine linen, and of purple, and of silk, and of scarlet; and all wood citron and every article of ivory and every article of wood most precious; and of bronze, and of iron, and of marble; and cinnamon, and spice, and incense, and myrrh, and frankincense; and wine, and oil, and finest flour, and wheat; and cattle, and sheep, and of horses, and of chariots; and of slaves and souls of men.
135715 ^ and the ripe fruit of you of the desire
135721 ^ of the soul are departed from you,
135726 ^ and all the sumptuous things and the splendid things have departed from you,
135736 ^ and no longer no not them they will find.
135742 ^ the merchants of these things
135745 ^ - having been enriched from her, from afar will stand, because of the fear of the torment of her,
135758 ^ weeping
135759 ^ and mourning,
135761 ^ saying:
135762 ^ woe, woe, the city - great,
135768 ^ - having been clothed with fine linen and purple and scarlet,
135775 ^ and having been adorned with gold and stone precious and pearl!
135784 ^ for [in] one hour has been brought to desolation - such great wealth.
135791 ^ and every shipmaster,
135794 ^ and all those to a place
135799 ^ sailing, and sailors, and
135803 ^ as many as the sea trade by, at a distance stood,
135810 ^ and were crying out,
135812 ^ seeing the smoke of the burning of her,
135818 ^ saying,
135819 ^ what [is] like the city - great?
135825 ^ and they cast dust upon the heads of them,
135832 ^ and they were crying out,
135834 ^ weeping
135835 ^ and mourning,
135837 ^ saying:
135838 ^ woe, woe, the city - great,
135844 ^ in which were enriched
135847 ^ all those having - ships in the sea through the wealth of her!
135859 ^ for in one hour she has been brought to desolation.
135863 ^ rejoice over her, o heaven, and - [you] saints, and - apostles, and - prophets,
135876 ^ because did judge - god the judgment for you against her.
135885 ^ and took up one angel a mighty stone, like a millstone great,
135894 ^ and cast [it] into the sea,
135899 ^ saying:
135900 ^ thus with violence will be cast down babylon the great city,
135907 ^ and no not shall be found any longer.
135912 ^ and sound of harpists and musicians, and flute players and trumpeters, no not shall be heard in you any longer.
135927 ^ and any craftsmen of any craft no not shall be found in you any longer,
135938 ^ and [the] sound of a millstone no not shall be heard in you any longer.
135947 ^ and [the] light of lamp, no not shall shine in you any longer;
135956 ^ and [the] voice of a bridegroom and a bride, no not shall be heard in you any longer;
135967 ^ for the merchants of you were the great ones of the earth,
135976 ^ because by the sorcery of you were deceived all the nations.
135985 ^ and in her [the] blood of prophets and of saints was found,
135993 ^ and of all those having been slain on the earth.
136000 ^ after these things i heard [something] like a voice loud of a multitude great in - heaven,
136011 ^ crying out:
136012 ^ hallelujah!
136013 ^ the salvation and the glory and the power to the god of us!
136024 ^ for true and righteous [are] the judgments of him,
136031 ^ because he has judged the prostitute - great,
136037 ^ who had corrupted the earth with the sexual immorality of her,
136045 ^ and he has avenged the blood of the servants of him, out of [the] hand of her.
136055 ^ and a second time they said:
136058 ^ hallelujah!
136059 ^ and the smoke of her goes up to the ages of the ages.
136069 ^ and fell down the elders - twenty four and the four living creatures,
136080 ^ and they worshiped - god,
136084 ^ the [one] sitting on the throne,
136089 ^ saying:
136090 ^ amen, hallelujah!
136092 ^ and a voice from the throne came forth,
136098 ^ saying:
136099 ^ praise the god of us, all the servants of him, and
136108 ^ those fearing him, the small and the great!
136116 ^ and i heard [something] like [the] voice of a multitude great, and like [the] sound of waters many, and like a sound of thunders mighty,
136132 ^ saying:
136133 ^ hallelujah!
136134 ^ for has reigned [the] lord - god of us the almighty.
136142 ^ we should rejoice
136143 ^ and should exult,
136145 ^ and will give the glory to him,
136150 ^ because has come the marriage of the lamb,
136156 ^ and the bride of him has made ready herself.
136162 ^ and it was given to her
136165 ^ that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright, pure.
136170 ^ - for
136172 ^ the fine linen, the righteous acts of the saints is.
136178 ^ and he says to me,
136181 ^ write,
136182 ^ blessed [are]
136183 ^ those to the supper of the marriage of the lamb
136191 ^ having been invited.
136192 ^ and he says to me,
136195 ^ these the words true - of god are.
136202 ^ and i fell before the feet of him
136208 ^ to worship him.
136210 ^ and he says to me,
136213 ^ see that you not.
136215 ^ a fellow servant with you i am,
136218 ^ and the brothers of you,
136222 ^ - holding the testimony of jesus.
136227 ^ - god worship!
136230 ^ the for
136232 ^ testimony of jesus is the spirit - of prophecy.
136239 ^ and i saw - heaven
136243 ^ having been opened,
136244 ^ and behold,
136246 ^ a horse white,
136248 ^ and
136249 ^ the [one] sitting upon it,
136253 ^ called faithful and true,
136257 ^ and in righteousness he judges
136261 ^ and makes war.
136263 ^ - and
136265 ^ the eyes of him [are] like a flame of fire,
136270 ^ and upon the head of him royal crowns many,
137088 ^ the [one] overcoming will inherit all things,
137092 ^ and i will be his god,
137096 ^ and he will be my son.
137101 ^ - but
137103 ^ to the cowardly and unbelieving and
137107 ^ having become abominable and murderers and the sexually immoral and sorcerers and idolaters and all - liars,
137120 ^ the portion of them [is] in the lake
137126 ^ - burning with fire and brimstone,
137131 ^ which is the death - second.
137137 ^ and came one of the seven angels,
137144 ^ - having the seven bowls
137149 ^ - being full of the seven plagues - last,
137156 ^ and spoke with me,
137160 ^ saying,
137161 ^ come here,
137162 ^ i will show you the bride, the wife of the lamb.
137170 ^ and he carried away me in [the] spirit to a mountain great and high,
137180 ^ and he showed me the city - holy jerusalem,
137188 ^ descending out of - heaven from - god,
137195 ^ having the glory - of god.
137200 ^ the radiance of it [was] like a stone most precious, like a stone jasper
137209 ^ being clear as crystal,
137684 ^ the things that must come to pass in quickness.
137689 ^ and behold,
137691 ^ i am coming quickly.
137693 ^ blessed [is]

137710 ^ and when i heard
137713 ^ and saw,
137715 ^ i fell down
137716 ^ to worship before the feet of the angel
137722 ^ - showing me these things.
137726 ^ and he says to me,
137729 ^ see that you not.
