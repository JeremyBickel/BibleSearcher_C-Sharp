40.12:12.w1-w5^how much therefore is more valuable a man than a sheep!

40.12:29.w22-w27^and then the house of him he will plunder.
40.12:3.w1-w4^- and he said to them,

40.12:33.w21-w27^by for the fruit, the tree is known.
40.12:33.w21^by
40.12:34.w1-w8^offspring of vipers, how are you able good things to speak, evil being?
40.12:34.w5-w6^good things to speak,
40.12:34.w7-w8^evil being?
40.12:34.w9-w17^out of for the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.

40.12:35.w1-w9^the good man out of his good treasure puts forth good things;
40.12:35.w10-w19^and the evil man out of his evil treasure puts forth evil things.
40.12:36.w1-w3^i say now to you
40.12:36.w4-w11^that every word careless that will speak - men,
40.12:36.w8-w11^that will speak - men,
40.12:36.w12-w18^they will give of it an account in day of judgment.
40.12:37.w1-w6^by for the words of you, you will be justified,
40.12:37.w1^by
40.12:37.w7-w12^and by the words of you, you will be condemned.
40.12:38.w1-w9^then answered him some of the scribes and pharisees, saying,
40.12:38.w9_2^saying,
40.12:38.w10-w15^teacher, we wish from you a sign to see.
40.12:38.w12-w15^from you a sign to see.
40.12:39.w1-w5^- and answering he said to them,
40.12:39.w3_2^answering
40.12:39.w6-w11^a generation evil and adulterous a sign seeks for,
40.12:39.w12-w16^and a sign not will be given to it,
40.12:39.w17-w23^if not the sign of jonah the prophet.
40.12:4.w1-w7^how he entered into the house - of god,
40.12:4.w8-w13^and the loaves of the presentation they ate,
40.12:4.w14_2^which
40.12:4.w16_2^lawful
40.12:4.w20-w23^nor for those with him,
40.12:4.w24-w28^if not for the priests only?
40.12:40.w1-w14^just as for was jonah in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights,
40.12:40.w15-w30^so will be the son - of man in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.
40.12:41.w1-w10^the men of nineveh will stand up in the judgment with the generation this,
40.12:41.w11-w13^and will condemn it;
40.12:41.w14-w19^for they repented at the preaching of jonah;
40.12:41.w20-w21^and behold,
40.12:41.w22-w24^greater than jonah here.
40.12:42.w1-w10^the queen of [the] south will rise up in the judgment with the generation this,
40.12:42.w11-w13^and will condemn it;
40.12:42.w14-w24^for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon,
40.12:42.w21-w24^to hear the wisdom of solomon,
40.12:42.w25-w26^and behold,
40.12:42.w27-w29^greater than solomon here.
40.12:43.w1-w9^when now the unclean spirit is gone out from the man,
40.12:43.w10-w15^it passes through waterless places seeking rest,
40.12:43.w14-w15^seeking rest,
40.12:43.w16-w18^and none finds [it].
40.12:44.w1-w2^then it says,
40.12:44.w3-w7^to the house of me i will return,
40.12:44.w8-w9^from where i came out.
40.12:44.w10-w16^and having come, it finds [it] being unoccupied, swept, and put in order.
40.12:44.w11_2^having come,
40.12:44.w13_2^being unoccupied,
40.12:44.w14_2^swept,
40.12:44.w15-w16^and put in order.
40.12:45.w1-w2^then it goes
40.12:45.w3-w11^and takes with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself,
40.12:45.w12-w15^and having entered in they dwell there;
40.12:45.w13_2^having entered in
40.12:45.w16-w25^and becomes the last of the man that worse than the first.
40.12:45.w26-w33^so it will be also unto generation this the evil.

40.13:12.w8-w11^whoever now not has,
40.13:12.w12-w17^even what he has will be taken away from him.
40.13:12.w13-w14^what he has
40.13:13.w1-w6^because of this, in parables to them i speak:
40.13:13.w7-w10^because seeing, not do they see;
40.13:13.w8_2^seeing,
40.13:13.w11-w14^and hearing, not do they hear,
40.13:13.w12_2^hearing,
40.13:13.w15-w16^nor do they understand.
40.13:14.w1-w8^and is fulfilled in them the prophecy of isaiah, - saying:
40.13:14.w7-w8_2^- saying:
40.13:14.w9-w10^in hearing you will hear,
40.13:14.w11-w14^and no not understand;
40.13:14.w15-w17^and seeing you will see
40.13:14.w16_2^seeing
40.13:14.w18-w21^and no not perceive.
40.13:15.w1-w7^has grown dull for the heart of the people this,
40.13:15.w8-w12^and with the ears barely they have heard,
40.13:15.w13-w17^and the eyes of them they have closed;
40.13:15.w18-w21^not lest they should see with the eyes,
40.13:15.w22-w25^and with the ears they should hear,
40.13:15.w26-w29^and with the heart they should understand,
40.13:15.w30-w31^and should return,
40.13:15.w32-w34^and i will heal them.’
40.13:16.w1-w5^of you however blessed [are] the eyes,
40.13:16.w1^of you
40.13:16.w6-w7^because they see;
40.13:16.w8-w11^and the ears of you,
40.13:16.w12-w13^because they hear.
40.13:17.w1-w4^truly for i say to you,
40.13:17.w5-w13^that many prophets and righteous [men] longed to see what you see,
40.13:17.w11-w13^to see what you see,
40.13:17.w12-w13^what you see,
40.13:17.w14-w16^and not saw;
40.13:17.w17-w20^and to hear what you hear,
40.13:17.w18-w20^to hear what you hear,
40.13:17.w19-w20^what you hear,
40.13:17.w21-w23^and not heard.
40.13:18.w1-w7^you therefore hear the parable of the [one] having sown:
40.13:18.w6-w7_2^of the [one] having sown:
40.13:19.w1-w6^everyone hearing the word of the kingdom
40.13:19.w7-w9^and not understanding,
40.13:19.w10-w12^comes the evil one
40.13:19.w13-w20^and snatches away that having been sown in the heart of him.
40.13:19.w15-w20^that having been sown in the heart of him.
40.13:19.w21-w27^this is the [one] on the path having been sown.

40.13:19.w23^the [one]
40.13:2.w1-w6^and were gathered together to him crowds great,
40.13:2.w7-w12^so that he into a boat having entered sat down,
40.13:2.w11_2^having entered
40.13:2.w13-w20^and all the crowd on the shore stood.
40.13:20.w1-w6^that which now upon the rocky places having been sown,
40.13:20.w1^that which
40.13:20.w7-w18^this is the [one] the word hearing, and immediately with joy receiving it;
40.13:20.w9-w12^the [one] the word hearing,
40.13:20.w9^the [one]
40.13:20.w13-w18^and immediately with joy receiving it;
40.13:21.w1-w6^no he has now root in himself,
40.13:21.w7-w9^but temporary is;
40.13:21.w10-w17^having come however tribulation or persecution on account of the word,
40.13:21.w18-w19^immediately he falls away.
40.13:22.w1-w6^that which now among the thorns having been sown,
40.13:22.w1^that which
40.13:22.w7-w12^this is the [one] the word hearing,

40.13:22.w9^the [one]
40.13:22.w13-w25^and the care - [the] present age and the deceit - of riches choke the word,
40.13:22.w26-w28^and unfruitful it becomes.
40.13:23.w1-w7^that however on the good soil having been sown,
40.13:23.w1^that
40.13:23.w8-w15^this is the [one] the word hearing and understanding,
40.13:23.w10-w13^the [one] the word hearing
40.13:23.w10^the [one]
40.13:23.w14-w15^and understanding,
40.13:23.w16-w18^who indeed brings forth fruit
40.13:23.w19-w20^and produces —
40.13:23.w21-w23^some indeed a hundredfold,
40.13:23.w24-w26^some now sixty,
40.13:23.w27-w29^some now thirty.
40.13:24.w1-w5^another parable put he before them, saying,
40.13:24.w5_2^saying,
40.13:24.w6-w18^has become like the kingdom of the heavens, a man having sown good seed in the field of him.
40.13:24.w12-w18^having sown good seed in the field of him.
40.13:25.w1-w6^in now the [time] are sleeping the men,
40.13:25.w1^in
40.13:25.w11-w17^and sowed weeds in [the] midst of the wheat,
40.13:25.w18-w19^and went away.
40.13:26.w1-w5^when now sprouted the plants
40.13:26.w6-w8^and fruit produced,
40.13:26.w9-w13^then appeared also the weeds.
40.13:27.w1_2^having come to [him]
40.13:27.w9-w17^sir, not good seed did you sow in - your field?
40.13:27.w18-w21^how then has it the weeds?
40.13:28.w1-w4^- and he said to them,
40.13:28.w5-w8^an enemy, a man this did.
40.13:28.w9-w13^- and the servants said, to him
40.13:28.w9^-
40.13:28.w14-w15^do you desire then
40.13:28.w16_2^[that] having gone forth,
40.13:29.w1-w3^- and he said,
40.13:29.w4_2^no;
40.13:29.w5-w13^not lest gathering the weeds, you would uproot with them the wheat.
40.13:29.w6-w8^gathering the weeds,
40.13:3.w1-w7^and he spoke to them many things in parables, saying,
40.13:3.w7_2^saying,
40.13:3.w8_2^behold,
40.13:3.w9-w13^went out the [one] sowing - to sow.
40.13:3.w10-w11_2^the [one] sowing
40.13:3.w12-w13_2^- to sow.
40.13:30.w1-w6^allow to grow together both until the harvest;
40.13:30.w2-w6^to grow together both until the harvest;
40.13:30.w7-w14^and in the time of the harvest i will say to the harvesters,
40.13:30.w15-w18^gather first the weeds,
40.13:30.w19-w27^and bind them into bundles in order - to burn them;
40.13:30.w24-w27^in order - to burn them;
40.13:30.w28-w35^- and the wheat, gather together into the barn of me.”’
40.13:30.w28^-
40.13:31.w1-w5^another parable put he before them, saying,
40.13:31.w5_2^saying,
40.13:31.w6-w21^like is the kingdom of the heavens to a grain of mustard, which having taken, a man sowed in the field of him;
40.13:31.w6^like
40.13:31.w14-w15^which having taken,
40.13:32.w1-w7^which smallest indeed is of all the seeds;
40.13:32.w2^smallest
40.13:32.w8-w10^when however it is grown,
40.13:32.w11-w14^greater than the garden plants it is,
40.13:32.w15-w17^and becomes a tree,
40.13:32.w18-w23^so that come the birds of the air
40.13:32.w24-w29^and perch in the branches of it.
40.13:33.w1-w4^another parable spoke he to them:
40.13:33.w5-w23^like is the kingdom of the heavens to leaven, which having taken, a woman hid in of flour measures three, until of it was leavened all.
40.13:33.w5^like
40.13:33.w12-w13^which having taken,
40.13:33.w20-w23^until of it was leavened all.
40.13:34.w1-w9^these things all spoke - jesus in parables to the crowds,
40.13:34.w10-w15^and without a parable not he was speaking to them,
40.13:35.w1-w8^so that might be fulfilled that having been spoken by the prophet, saying,
40.13:35.w3-w8^that having been spoken by the prophet, saying,
40.13:35.w8_2^saying,
40.13:35.w9-w14^i will open in parables the mouth of me;
40.13:35.w15-w19^i will utter things hidden from [the] foundation [of the] world.”
40.13:35.w16-w19^things hidden from [the] foundation [of the] world.”
40.13:36.w1-w8^then having dismissed the crowds, he went into the house.
40.13:36.w2-w4^having dismissed the crowds,
40.13:36.w9-w15^and came to him the disciples of him, saying,
40.13:36.w15_2^saying,
40.13:36.w16-w23^explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.
40.13:37.w1-w4^- and answering he said,
40.13:37.w3_2^answering
40.13:37.w5-w9^the [one] sowing the good seed
40.13:38.w1-w6^- and the field is the world;
40.13:38.w1^-
40.13:38.w7-w10^- and the good seed,
40.13:38.w7^-
40.13:38.w11-w16^these are the sons of the kingdom;
40.13:38.w17-w24^- and the weeds are the sons of the evil [one];
40.13:38.w17^-
40.13:39.w1-w9^- and the enemy - having sown them is the devil;
40.13:39.w1^-
40.13:39.w4-w6^- having sown them
40.13:39.w10-w15^- and the harvest [the] consummation of the age is,
40.13:39.w10^-
40.13:39.w16-w20^- and the harvesters angels are.
40.13:39.w16^-
40.13:4.w1-w11^and in - sowing of him, some indeed fell along the road,
40.13:4.w2-w5^in - sowing of him,
40.13:4.w12-w17^and having come, the birds devoured them.
40.13:4.w13_2^having come,
40.13:40.w1-w5^as therefore is gathered the weeds,
40.13:40.w6-w8^and in fire is consumed,
40.13:40.w9-w15^thus it will be in the consummation of the age.
40.13:41.w1-w8^will send forth the son - of man the angels of him,
40.13:41.w9-w22^and they will gather out of the kingdom of him all the causes of sin and those practicing - lawlessness,
40.13:41.w18-w22^and those practicing - lawlessness,
40.13:42.w1-w8^and they will cast them into the furnace of the fire;
40.13:42.w9-w17^there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
40.13:43.w1-w13^then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of the father of them.
40.13:43.w14-w16^the [one] having ears,
40.13:44.w1-w11^like is the kingdom of the heavens treasure having been hidden in the field,
40.13:44.w1^like

40.13:44.w16-w21^and for the joy of it goes
40.13:44.w22-w26^and he sells all that he has
40.13:44.w25-w26^that he has
40.13:44.w27-w31^and buys the field that.

40.13:46.w1-w5^having found now one very precious pearl,
40.13:46.w6_2^having gone away,
40.13:46.w9-w10^as many as he had,
40.13:46.w11-w13^and bought it.
40.13:47.w1-w17^again like is the kingdom of the heavens a dragnet having been cast into the sea, and of every kind having gathered together,

40.13:5.w1-w6^other now fell upon the rocky places,
40.13:5.w7-w11^where not it had soil much,
40.13:5.w12-w20^and immediately it sprang up, through - not having depth of soil;

40.13:51.w1-w3^have you understood these things all?
40.13:51.w4-w5^they say to him,
40.13:51.w6_2^yes.

40.16:23.w14-w19^for not your thoughts are of the things - of god,
40.16:23.w20-w23^but the things of men.
40.16:24.w1-w7^then - jesus said to disciples of him,
40.16:24.w8-w13^if anyone desires after me to come,
40.16:24.w11-w13^after me to come,
40.16:24.w14-w15^let him deny himself,

40.16:26.w1-w4^what for will it profit a man,
40.16:26.w5-w9^if the world whole he gains,
40.16:26.w10-w14^- but the soul of him loses?
40.16:26.w10^-
40.16:26.w15-w22^or what will give a man [as] an exchange for the soul of him?
40.16:27.w1-w17^is about for the son of the man to come in the glory the father of him, with the angels of him;
40.16:27.w7-w17^to come in the glory the father of him, with the angels of him;
40.16:27.w18-w25^and then he will give to each according to the deeds of him.
40.16:28.w1-w3^truly i say to you
40.16:28.w4-w9^-, there are some of those here standing
40.16:28.w7-w9^of those here standing

40.16:4.w12-w16^if not the sign of jonah.
40.16:4.w17-w20^and having left them, he went away.
40.16:4.w18-w19^having left them,
40.16:5.w1-w10^and having come the disciples to the other side, they forgot bread to take.
40.16:5.w2_2^having come
40.16:5.w9-w10^bread to take.
40.16:6.w1-w5^- and jesus said to them,

40.16:6.w7-w15^and beware of the leaven of the pharisees and sadducees.
40.16:7.w1-w6^- and they were reasoning among themselves, saying,
40.16:7.w6_2^saying,
40.16:7.w7-w10^because bread not we took.
40.16:8.w1_2^having known [this]
40.16:8.w6-w10^why reason you among yourselves, o [you] of little faith,
40.16:8.w11-w14^because bread not you took?
40.16:9.w1-w2^not yet do you understand,
40.16:9.w3-w9^nor remember the five loaves for the five thousand,
40.16:9.w10-w13^and how many hand-baskets you gathered?
40.17:1.w1-w16^and after days six, takes with [him] - jesus, - peter and james and john, the brother of him,
40.17:1.w17-w24^and brings up them into a mountain high by themselves.
40.17:10.w1-w6^and asked him the disciples, saying,
40.17:10.w6_2^saying,
40.17:10.w7-w11^why then the scribes say
40.17:10.w12-w16^that elijah it behooves to come first?
40.17:10.w13_2^elijah
40.17:11.w1-w4^- and answering, he said,
40.17:11.w3_2^answering,
40.17:11.w5-w7^elijah indeed comes,
40.17:11.w8-w10^and will restore all things.
40.17:12.w1-w3^i say however to you
40.17:12.w4-w7^that elijah already is come,
40.17:12.w8-w11^and not they knew him,
40.17:12.w12-w17^but did to him whatever they desired.
40.17:12.w16-w17^whatever they desired.
40.17:12.w18-w27^thus also, the son - of man is about to suffer from them.
40.17:12.w25-w27^to suffer from them.
40.17:13.w1-w4^then understood the disciples
40.17:13.w5-w11^that concerning john the baptist he spoke to them.
40.17:14.w1-w5^and they having come to the crowd,
40.17:14.w6-15.w2^came to him a man kneeling down to him and saying,
40.17:14.w9-w10^kneeling down to him
40.17:15.w1-w2^and saying,
40.17:15.w3-w7^lord, have mercy on my - son,
40.17:15.w8-w9^for he is epileptic
40.17:15.w10-w12^and miserably suffers;
40.17:15.w13-w18^often for he falls into the fire,
40.17:15.w19-w23^and often into the water.
40.17:16.w1-w6^and i brought him to the disciples of you,
40.17:16.w7-w11^and not they were able him to heal.
40.17:16.w10-w11^him to heal.
40.17:17.w1_2^answering

40.17:17.w20-w23^bring to me him here.
40.17:18.w1-w5^and rebuked him - jesus,
40.17:18.w6-w11^and went out from him the demon,
40.17:18.w12-w19^and was healed the boy from the hour that.
40.17:19.w1-w9^then having come the disciples - to jesus in private, they said,
40.17:19.w2_2^having come
40.17:19.w10-w16^because of why we not were able to cast out it?
40.17:19.w15-w16^to cast out it?
40.17:2.w1-w4^and he was transfigured before them,
40.17:2.w5-w12^and shone the face of him like the sun,
40.17:2.w13-w21^- and the clothes of him became white as the light.
40.17:2.w13^-
40.17:20.w1-w4^- and he said to them,
40.17:20.w5-w8_2^because of the little faith of you.
40.17:20.w9-w12^truly for i say to you,
40.17:20.w13-w18^if you have faith as a seed of mustard,
40.17:20.w19-w22^you will say to the mountain to this,
40.17:20.w23-w25^move from here to there,
40.17:20.w26-w27^and it will move.
40.17:20.w28-w31^and nothing will be impossible for you.”
40.17:22.w1-w6^were abiding now they in - galilee,
40.17:22.w7-w10^said to them - jesus,
40.17:22.w11-w19^is about the son - of man to be betrayed into [the] hands of men,

40.17:23.w1-w3^and they will kill him,
40.17:23.w4-w8^and on the third day he will be raised up.
40.17:23.w9-w11^and they were grieved deeply.
40.17:24.w1-w5^having come now they to capernaum,

40.17:6.w2_2^having heard [it],
40.17:6.w9-w11^and were terrified greatly.
40.17:7.w1-w4^and having come to [them] - jesus,

40.18:12.w1-w3^what you do think?
40.18:12.w4-w9^if there should be to any man a hundred sheep,
40.18:12.w10-w14^and has gone astray one of them,
40.18:12.w15-w22^not will he leave the ninety nine on the mountains,

40.21:33.w10-w13^and a fence it placed around,
40.21:33.w14-w18^and dug in it a winepress,
40.21:33.w19-w21^and built a tower,
40.21:33.w22-w25^and rented out it to farmers,
40.21:33.w26-w27^and traveled abroad.
40.21:34.w1-w7^when then drew near the season of the fruits,
40.21:34.w8-w18^he sent the servants of him to the farmers to receive the fruits of him.
40.21:34.w15-w18^to receive the fruits of him.
40.21:35.w1-w10^and having taken the farmers the servants of him, one - they beat,

40.21:35.w11-w13^one then they killed,
40.21:35.w14-w16^one then they stoned.
40.21:36.w1-w7^again he sent other servants, more than the first,
40.21:36.w8-w11^and they did to them likewise.
40.21:37.w1-w9^afterward then, he sent to them the son of him, saying,
40.21:37.w9_2^saying,
40.21:37.w10-w13^they will respect the son of me.
40.21:38.w1-w9^- but the farmers having seen the son, said among themselves,
40.21:38.w1^-
40.21:38.w4-w6^having seen the son,
40.21:38.w10-w13^this is the heir;

40.21:38.w15-w16^let us kill him
40.21:38.w17-w21^and gain possession of the inheritance of him.

40.21:39.w2-w3^having taking him,
40.21:39.w8-w9^and killed [him].
40.21:4.w1-w3^this then came to pass
40.21:4.w4-w11^that it might be fulfilled that having been spoken by the prophet, saying,
40.21:4.w6-w11^that having been spoken by the prophet, saying,
40.21:4.w11_2^saying,
40.21:40.w1-w7^when therefore shall come the master of the vineyard,
40.21:40.w8-w12^what will he do the farmers to those?
40.21:41.w1-w2^they say to him,
40.21:41.w3-w6^[the] wretches, grievously he will destroy them,
40.21:41.w3^[the] wretches,
40.21:41.w7-w21^and the vineyard he will rent out to other farmers, who will give to him the fruits in the seasons of them.
40.21:41.w13-w21^who will give to him the fruits in the seasons of them.
40.21:42.w1-w4^says to them - jesus,

40.21:42.w20-w23^from [the] lord was this,
40.21:42.w24-w29^and it is marvelous in [the] eyes of us?’
40.21:43.w1-w4^because of this i say to you
40.21:43.w5-w12^that will be taken away from you the kingdom - of god,
40.21:43.w13-w19^and it will be given to a people producing the fruits of it.
40.21:43.w16-w19^producing the fruits of it.
40.21:44.w1-w8^and the [one] having fallen on the stone this will be broken;
40.21:44.w2-w7^the [one] having fallen on the stone this
40.21:44.w9-w13^on whomever but - it shall fall,
40.21:44.w14-w15^it will grind to powder him.

40.22:29.w12-w16^nor the power - of god.
40.22:3.w1-w11^and he sent the servants of him to call those having been invited to the wedding feast,

40.22:32.w14-w18^not he is the god of [the] dead,
40.22:32.w19-w20^but of [the] living.
40.22:32.w20_2^of [the] living.
40.22:33.w1-w9^and having heard, the crowds were astonished at the teaching of him.
40.22:33.w2_2^having heard,

40.22:45.w7-w10^how son of him is he?
40.22:46.w1-w6^and no one was able to answer him a word,
40.22:46.w4-w6^to answer him a word,
40.22:46.w7-w16^nor dared anyone from that - day to question him no longer.

40.24:48.w12-w15^delays of me the master,
40.24:49.w1-w13^and should begin to beat the fellow servants of him, to eat then and to drink with those being drunkards,
40.24:49.w3-w6^to beat the fellow servants of him,

40.24:49.w11-w13_2^with those being drunkards,
40.24:5.w1-w8^many for will come in the name of me, saying,
40.24:5.w8_2^saying,
40.24:5.w9-w12^i am the christ,
40.24:5.w13-w15^and many they will mislead.
40.24:50.w1-w17^will come the master the servant of that in a day in which not he does expect, and in an hour which not he is aware,
40.24:50.w9-w11^in which not he does expect,
40.24:50.w15-w17^which not he is aware,
40.24:51.w1-w3^and will cut in pieces him,
40.24:51.w4-w11^and the place of him with the hypocrites will appoint;
40.24:51.w12-w20^there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
40.24:6.w1-w7^you will begin then to hear of wars and rumors of wars.

40.24:7.w6-w9^and kingdom against kingdom;
40.24:7.w10-w16^and there will be famines and earthquakes in [various] places.
40.24:8.w1-w5^all then these [are] [the] beginning of birth pains.
40.24:8.w1^all

41.12:10.w11-w15^this has become the chief corner;
41.12:11.w1-w4^from [the] lord was this,

41.12:12.w3-w4^him to lay hold of,
41.12:12.w5-w8^and they feared the crowd;

41.12:12.w11-w16^that against them the parable he had spoken.
41.12:12.w17-w20^and having left him, they went away.

41.12:15.w1-w8^- and knowing of them the hypocrisy, he said to them,
41.12:15.w3-w6^knowing of them the hypocrisy,
41.12:15.w9-w11^why me do you test?
41.12:15.w12-w14^bring me a denarius,
41.12:15.w15-w16^that i might see [it].
41.12:16.w1-w3^- and they brought [it].
41.12:16.w4-w6^and he says to them,

41.12:17.w10-w15^and the things - of god, - to god.
41.12:17.w16-w19^and they were amazed at him.
41.12:18.w1-w5^and come sadducees to him,
41.12:18.w6-w10^who say a resurrection not there is,
41.12:18.w8-w10^a resurrection not there is,
41.12:18.w11-w14^and they began questioning him, saying,
41.12:18.w14_2^saying,
41.12:19.w1-w4^teacher, moses wrote for us
41.12:19.w5-w9^that if of anyone a brother should die,
41.12:19.w10-w12^and leave behind a wife,
41.12:19.w13-w16^and not leave children,
41.12:19.w17-w23^that should take the brother of him the wife,
41.12:19.w24-w29^and raise up seed for the brother of him.
41.12:2.w1-w8^and he sent to the farmers at the due time a servant,
41.12:2.w9-w18^that from the farmers he might receive from the fruit of the vineyard.
41.12:20.w1-w3^seven brothers there were;
41.12:20.w4-w8^and the first took a wife,

41.12:22.w7-w12^last of all also, the woman died.
41.12:23.w1-w9^in the resurrection, when they rise, of which of them will she be wife?
41.12:23.w4-w5^when they rise,
41.12:23.w6-w7_2^of which of them
41.12:23.w10-w15^- for the seven had her as wife.
41.12:23.w10^-
41.12:24.w1-w4^was saying to them - jesus,
41.12:24.w5-w17^not because of this do you err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power - of god?
41.12:24.w9-w12^not knowing the scriptures,
41.12:24.w13-w17^nor the power - of god?
41.12:25.w1-w5^when for out from [the] dead they rise,
41.12:25.w6-w7^neither do they marry,
41.12:25.w8-w9^nor are given in marriage;
41.12:25.w10-w16^but are like angels in the heavens.
41.12:26.w1-w15^concerning now the dead, that they rise, not have you read in the book of moses, on the bush,
41.12:26.w1_2^concerning
41.12:26.w5-w6^that they rise,
41.12:26.w16-w21^how spoke to him - god, saying,

41.12:27.w6_2^of [the] living.
41.12:27.w7-w8^greatly you err.
41.12:28.w1-w15^and having come up one of the scribes, having heard them reasoning together, having seen that well he answered them, he questioned him,

41.12:34.w23-w24^him to question.
41.12:35.w1-w9^and answering, - jesus was saying, teaching in the temple,
41.12:35.w2_2^answering,
41.12:35.w6-w9^teaching in the temple,
41.12:35.w10-w13^how say the scribes

41.13:22.w1-w5^there will arise for false christs and false prophets,
41.13:22.w6-w17^and will give signs and wonders, so as - to deceive if possible, the elect.
41.13:22.w11-w17^so as - to deceive if possible, the elect.

41.13:24.w13-w20^and the moon not will give the light of it;
41.13:25.w1-w8^and the stars will be out of the heaven falling,
41.13:25.w5-w8^out of the heaven falling,
41.13:25.w9-w16^and the powers that [are] in the heavens will be shaken.’

41.7:6.w5-w11^rightly prophesied isaiah concerning you - hypocrites,
41.7:6.w12-w13^as it has been written
41.7:6.w14-w21^-: this - people with the lips me honors,

41.8:12.w1-w6^and having sighed deeply in the spirit of him, he says,
41.8:12.w2-w5^having sighed deeply in the spirit of him,
41.8:12.w7-w12^why the generation this seeks a sign?
41.8:12.w13-w15^truly i say to you,
41.8:12.w16-w21^if there will be given to the generation this a sign.
41.8:13.w1-w9^and having left them, again having embarked, he went away to the other side.

41.8:19.w14-w15^they say to him,
41.8:19.w16_2^twelve.
41.8:2.w1-w4^i am moved with compassion upon the crowd,
41.8:2.w5-w10^because already days three they continue with me,

42.11:11.w11-w16^and instead of a fish, a serpent to him will he give?
42.11:12.w1-w4^or also [if] he will ask for an egg,
42.11:12.w5-w7^will he give to him a scorpion?

42.11:17.w9-w14^every kingdom against itself having been divided is brought to desolation;
42.11:17.w11-w13^against itself having been divided
42.11:17.w15-w19^and a house against a house falls.
42.11:18.w1-w8^if now also - satan against himself is divided,
42.11:18.w9-w13^how will stand the kingdom of him?
42.11:18.w14-w21^for you say, by beelzebul cast out i the demons.
42.11:18.w16-w21^by beelzebul cast out i the demons.

42.11:2.w12-w15^come the kingdom of you.
42.11:20.w1-w9^if however by [the] finger of god i cast out the demons,
42.11:20.w10-w17^then has come upon you the kingdom - of god.
42.11:21.w1-w8^when the strong [man] being armed might guard - his house,
42.11:21.w4_2^being armed
42.11:21.w9-w14^in peace are the possessions of him;
42.11:21.w12-w14_2^the possessions of him;
42.11:22.w1-w7^when however [one] stronger than he, having come upon [him], shall overcome him,
42.11:22.w5_2^having come upon [him],
42.11:22.w8-w11^the complete armor of him he takes away
42.11:22.w12-w14^in which he had trusted,
42.11:22.w15-w19^and the plunder of him he divides.
42.11:23.w1-w5^the [one] not being with me
42.11:23.w1^the [one]
42.11:23.w9-w15^and the [one] not gathering with me scatters.
42.11:23.w10-w14^the [one] not gathering with me
42.11:23.w10^the [one]
42.11:24.w1-w8^when the unclean spirit is gone out from the man,
42.11:24.w9-w14^it passes through waterless places seeking rest;
42.11:24.w13-w14^seeking rest;
42.11:24.w15-w19^and not finding [any], then it says,
42.11:24.w16-w17^not finding [any],
42.11:24.w20-w24^i will return to the house of me,
42.11:24.w25-w26^from where i came out.

42.11:26.w11_2^having entered,
42.11:26.w14-w23^and becomes the last of the man that worse than the first.
42.11:27.w1-w7^it came to pass then, in - saying his these things,

42.11:5.w15-w17^and say to him,

42.12:1.w8-w10^so as to trample upon one another,
42.12:1.w11-w16^he began to say to the disciples of him
42.12:1.w12-w16^to say to the disciples of him
42.12:1.w17-w27^first, take heed to yourselves of the leaven, which is hypocrisy, of the pharisees.
42.12:1.w23-w25^which is hypocrisy,
42.12:10.w1-w10^and everyone who will speak a word against the son - of man,

42.12:11.w17-w19^or what you shall reply in defense,

42.12:13.w13-w17^to divide with me the inheritance.
42.12:14.w1-w4^- and he said to him,
42.12:14.w5-w13^man, who me appointed a judge or partitioner over you?
42.12:15.w1-w4^he said then to them,
42.12:15.w5_2^beware
42.12:15.w6-w10^and keep yourselves from all covetousness;
42.12:15.w11-w24^for not in the abundance to anyone, the life to him is of that which possesses of him.
42.12:15.w13-w16^in the abundance to anyone,
42.12:15.w21-w24_2^of that which possesses of him.
42.12:16.w1-w6^he spoke then a parable to them, saying,
42.12:16.w6_2^saying,
42.12:16.w7-w12^of a man certain rich brought forth abundantly the ground.
42.12:16.w7-w9_2^of a man certain rich
42.12:17.w1-w5^and he was reasoning within himself, saying,
42.12:17.w5_2^saying,
42.12:17.w6-w7^what shall i do,
42.12:17.w8-w15^for not i have where i will store up the fruits of me?
42.12:17.w11-w15^where i will store up the fruits of me?
42.12:18.w1-w2^and he said,
42.12:18.w3-w4^this will i do:
42.12:18.w5-w8^i will tear down my - barns
42.12:18.w9-w11^and greater will build,
42.12:18.w12-w21^and will store up there all the grain and the goods of me.
42.12:19.w1-w5^and i will say to the soul of me,
42.12:19.w6-w13^soul, you have many good things laid up for years many;
42.12:19.w10-w13^laid up for years many;

42.12:2.w8-w9^nor hidden
42.12:2.w10-w12^which not will be known.
42.12:20.w1-w5^said then to him - god,
42.12:20.w6-w15^fool! this - night, the soul of you is required of you;
42.12:20.w16_2^what
42.12:21.w1-w9^so [is] the [one] treasuring up for himself, and not toward god being rich.
42.12:21.w2-w4^the [one] treasuring up for himself,
42.12:21.w5-w9^and not toward god being rich.
42.12:22.w1-w6^he said then to the disciples of him,
42.12:22.w7-w10^because of this i say to you,
42.12:22.w11-w14^not be anxious for the life,
42.12:22.w15-w16^what you should eat,
42.12:22.w17-w19^nor for the body
42.12:22.w20-w21^what you should put on.
42.12:23.w1-w7^the for life more than is the food,
42.12:23.w1^the
42.12:23.w4^more than
42.12:23.w8-w12^and the body than the clothing.
42.12:24.w1-w3^consider the ravens,
42.12:24.w4-w6^that not they sow
42.12:24.w7-w8^nor reap;
42.12:24.w9-w12^to them not there is a storehouse

42.12:26.w4_2^[the] least
42.12:26.w6-w10^why about the rest are you anxious?
42.12:27.w1-w3^consider the lilies,
42.12:27.w4-w5^how they grow:
42.12:27.w6-w7^not do they labor,
42.12:27.w8-w9^nor do they spin.
42.12:27.w10-w12^i say however to you,
42.12:27.w13-w20^not even solomon in all the glory of him was arrayed
42.12:27.w21-w23^as one of these.
42.12:28.w1-w17^if however in [the] field the grass, being [here] today and tomorrow into the furnace being thrown, - god thus clothes,

42.16:27.w7-w15^that you would send him to the house of the father of me —
42.16:28.w1-w4^i have for five brothers —
42.16:28.w5-w7^so that he might warn them,
42.16:28.w8-w18^that not also they might come to the place this - of torment.
42.16:29.w1-w3^says however abraham,
42.16:29.w4-w8^they have moses and the prophets;
42.16:29.w9-w10^let them hear them.
42.16:3.w1-w6^said then within himself the manager,
42.16:3.w7-w8^what shall i do,
42.16:3.w9-w17^for the master of me is taking away the management from me?
42.16:3.w18_2^to dig
42.16:3.w21_2^to beg
42.16:30.w1-w3^- and he said,
42.16:30.w4-w6^no, father abraham,
42.16:30.w7-w14^but if one from [the] dead should go to them,
42.16:30.w15_2^they will repent.
42.16:31.w1-w3^he said however to him,
42.16:31.w4-w10^if moses and the prophets not they hear,
42.16:31.w11-w17^not even if one out from [the] dead should rise, will they be persuaded.
42.16:31.w12-w16^if one out from [the] dead should rise,
42.16:4.w1-w3^i know what i will do
42.16:4.w2-w3^what i will do
42.16:4.w4-w9^so that when i shall have been removed from the management,
42.16:4.w10-w15^they might receive me into the homes of them.
42.16:5.w1-w12^and having called to [him] one each of the debtors of the master of him, he was saying to the first,
42.16:5.w2-w9^having called to [him] one each of the debtors of the master of him,
42.16:5.w13-w17^how much owe you to master of me?
42.16:6.w1-w3^- and he said,
42.16:6.w4-w6_2^a hundred baths of oil.
42.16:6.w7-w10^- and he said to him,
42.16:6.w11-w14^take your the bill
42.16:6.w15-w19^and, having sat down quickly, write fifty.
42.16:6.w16_2^having sat down
42.16:7.w1-w3^then to another he said,
42.16:7.w4-w7^you now how much owe?
42.16:7.w8-w10^- and he said,
42.16:7.w11-w13_2^a hundred cors of wheat.
42.16:7.w14-w15^he says to him,
42.16:7.w16-w19^take your - bill
42.16:7.w20-w22^and write eighty.
42.16:8.w1-w8^and praised the master the manager - unrighteous,
42.16:8.w9-w11^because shrewdly he had acted.
42.16:8.w12-w29^for the sons of the age this more shrewd than the sons of the light in the generation - of themselves are.
42.16:9.w1-w4^and i to you say,
42.16:9.w5-w12^for yourselves make friends by the wealth - of unrighteousness,
42.16:9.w13-w15^that when it fails
42.16:9.w16-w21^they might receive you into the eternal dwellings.
42.17:1.w1-w6^he said then to the disciples of him,
42.17:1.w7-w13^impossible it is for the stumbling blocks not to come,
42.17:1.w9-w13^for the stumbling blocks not to come,
42.17:1.w9^for
42.17:1.w14-w18^but woe [to him] by whom they come!
42.17:1.w16-w18^by whom they come!
42.17:10.w1-w10^thus also you, when you may have done all the [things] having been commanded you, say
42.17:10.w4-w9^when you may have done all the [things] having been commanded you,
42.17:10.w7-w9^the [things] having been commanded you,
42.17:10.w11-w14^-, servants unworthy are we;
42.17:10.w15_2^that which
42.17:11.w1-w7^and it came to pass in the going up to jerusalem
42.17:11.w3-w7^in the going up to jerusalem
42.17:11.w8-w15^that he was passing through [the] midst of samaria and galilee.
42.17:12.w1-w6^and on entering of him into a certain village,
42.17:12.w7-w11^met him ten leprous men,
42.17:12.w12-w14^who stood afar off.
42.17:13.w1-w5^and they lifted up [their] voice, saying,
42.17:13.w5_2^saying,
42.17:13.w6-w9^jesus, master, have compassion on us.
42.17:14.w1-w4^and having seen [them], he said to them,
42.17:14.w2_2^having seen [them],
42.17:14.w5_2^having gone,
42.17:14.w10-w15^and it came to pass in the going them,
42.17:14.w12-w15^in the going them,
42.17:14.w16_2^they were cleansed.
42.17:15.w1-w14^one then of them, having seen that he was healed, turned back, with a voice loud glorifying - god,
42.17:15.w1^one
42.17:15.w5_2^having seen
42.17:15.w6-w7^that he was healed,
42.17:15.w9-w14^with a voice loud glorifying - god,
42.17:16.w1-w10^and he fell on [his] face at the feet of him, giving thanks to him;
42.17:16.w9-w10^giving thanks to him;
42.17:16.w11-w14^and he was a samaritan.
42.17:17.w1_2^having answered
42.17:17.w6-w9^not the ten were cleansed?
42.17:17.w10-w13^- but the nine are where?
42.17:17.w10^-
42.17:18.w1-w7^none was there found having returned to give glory - to god,
42.17:18.w3_2^having returned
42.17:18.w8-w12^if not the foreigner this?
42.17:19.w1-w3^and he said to him,
42.17:19.w4_2^having risen up
42.17:19.w6-w10^the faith of you has cured you!”
42.17:2.w1-w2^it is better for him
42.17:2.w3-w10^if a stone of a mill is hung around the neck of him
42.17:2.w11-w15^and he is thrown into the sea,
42.17:2.w16-w22^than that he should cause to stumble - little of these one.
42.17:20.w1_2^having been asked
42.17:20.w6-w11^when is coming the kingdom - of god,
42.17:20.w14-w15^and said,
42.17:20.w16-w23^not comes the kingdom - of god with careful observation,
42.17:21.w1-w2^nor will they say,
42.17:21.w3-w4^behold here,
42.17:21.w5-w6^or there.
42.17:21.w7-w8^behold for,
42.17:21.w9-w15^the kingdom - of god in the midst of you is.”
42.17:22.w1-w5^he said then to the disciples,
42.17:22.w6-w7^will come days
42.17:22.w8-w17^when you will desire one of the days of the son - of man to see,
42.17:22.w10-w17^one of the days of the son - of man to see,
42.17:22.w18-w20^and not you will see [it].
42.17:23.w1-w3^and they will say to you,
42.17:23.w4-w5^behold there,
42.17:23.w6-w8^or behold here.
42.17:23.w9-w10^not go forth
42.17:23.w11-w12^nor follow.
42.17:24.w1-w15^as for the lightning flashing from the [one end] of the sky to the [other end] of the sky shines,
42.17:24.w5-w14^flashing from the [one end] of the sky to the [other end] of the sky
42.17:24.w16-w25^thus will be the son - of man in the day of him.
42.17:25.w1-w12^first however it behooves him many things to suffer, and to be rejected by the generation this.
42.17:25.w4-w6^him many things to suffer,
42.17:25.w7-w12^and to be rejected by the generation this.
42.17:26.w1-w7^and as it came to pass in the days of noah,
42.17:26.w8-w17^thus will it be also in the days of the son of man:
42.17:27.w1_2^they were eating,
42.17:27.w2_2^they were drinking,
42.17:27.w3_2^they were marrying,
42.17:27.w4_2^they were being given in marriage,
42.17:27.w5-w12^until that day entered noah into the ark,
42.17:27.w13-w16^and came the flood
42.17:27.w17-w19^and destroyed all.
42.17:28.w1-w7^likewise, as it came to pass in the days of lot,
42.17:28.w8_2^they were eating,
42.17:28.w9_2^they were drinking,
42.17:28.w10_2^they were buying,
42.17:28.w11_2^they were selling,

42.17:29.w1_2^in that
42.17:29.w14-w16^and destroyed all.
42.17:3.w1-w2^take heed to yourselves.
42.17:3.w3-w7^if should sin the brother of you,
42.17:3.w8-w9^rebuke him;
42.17:3.w10-w12^and if he should repent,
42.17:3.w13-w14^forgive him.
42.17:30.w1-w11^according - to these will it be in that day the son - of man is revealed.
42.17:30.w5-w11^in that day the son - of man is revealed.
42.17:31.w1-w20^in that - day, the [one who] will be on the housetop, and the goods of him in the house, not let him come down to take away them;
42.17:31.w5-w9^the [one who] will be on the housetop,
42.17:31.w10-w16^and the goods of him in the house,
42.17:31.w19-w20^to take away them;
42.17:31.w21-w30^and the [one] in [the] field, likewise not let him return to the things behind.
42.17:32.w1-w4^remember the wife of lot!
42.17:33.w1-w7^whoever if may seek the life of him to save,
42.17:33.w4-w7^the life of him to save,
42.17:33.w10-w13^whoever also - will lose [it],
42.17:34.w1-w2^i say to you,
42.17:34.w3-w10^in that - night there will be two upon bed one:
42.17:34.w11-w13^the one will be taken,
42.17:34.w14-w17^and the other will be left.
42.17:35.w1-w6^there will be two [women] grinding at the same [place]:
42.17:35.w3-w6^grinding at the same [place]:
42.17:35.w7-w9^the one will be taken,
42.17:35.w10-w13^- and the other will be left.”
42.17:35.w10^-
42.17:37.w1-w4^and answering, they say to him,
42.17:37.w2_2^answering,
42.17:37.w5-w6^where, lord?
42.17:37.w7-w10^- and he said to them,
42.17:37.w11-w13^where the body [is],
42.17:37.w14-w18^there also the vultures will be gathered together.
42.17:4.w1-w8^and if seven times in the day he should sin against you,
42.17:4.w9-w14^and seven times should return to you, saying
42.17:4.w14_2^saying
42.17:4.w15_2^i repent,
42.17:4.w16-w17^you shall forgive him.
42.17:5.w1-w6^and said the apostles to the lord,
42.17:5.w7-w9^add to us faith!
42.17:6.w1-w4^said then the lord,
42.17:6.w5-w10^if you have faith like a grain of mustard,
42.17:6.w11-w15^you would have said - to the mulberry tree this,
42.17:6.w16_2^be uprooted
42.17:6.w17-w21^and be planted in the sea,
42.17:6.w22-w25^and it would have obeyed - you.
42.17:7.w1-w9^which now of you a servant having, plowing or shepherding,

42.17:8.w1-w4^but not will he say to him,
42.17:8.w5-w7^prepare what i may eat,
42.17:8.w6-w7^what i may eat,
42.17:8.w8-w11^and having girded yourself about, serve me
42.17:8.w9_2^having girded yourself about,
42.17:8.w12-w13^while i eat
42.17:8.w14-w15^and drink;
42.17:8.w16-w19^and after these things shall eat
42.17:8.w20-w22^and drink you?’
42.17:9.w1-w5^not is he thankful to the servant
42.17:9.w6-w9^because he did the things having been commanded?
42.17:9.w8-w9_2^the things having been commanded?
42.18:1.w1-2.w1^he was speaking then a parable to them about the [way] it behooves always to pray them and not to lose heart, saying,
42.18:1.w5-w13^about the [way] it behooves always to pray them and not to lose heart,
42.18:1.w8-w10^always to pray them
42.18:1.w11-w13^and not to lose heart,
42.18:10.w1-w7^men two went up into the temple to pray,
42.18:10.w7_2^to pray,
42.18:10.w8-w10^the one a pharisee,
42.18:10.w11-w14^and the other a tax collector.
42.18:11.w1-w7^the pharisee, having stood, toward himself thus was praying,
42.18:11.w3-w5^having stood, toward himself
42.18:11.w8-w11^- god, i thank you
42.18:11.w12-w22^that not i am like the rest of the men — swindlers, unrighteous, adulterers —
42.18:11.w23-w28^or even like this - tax collector.
42.18:12.w1-w4^i fast twice in the week;
42.18:12.w5-w8^i tithe all things, as many as i gain.
42.18:12.w7-w8^as many as i gain.
42.18:13.w1-w14^- but the tax collector, afar off standing, not was willing not even the eyes to lift up to - heaven,

42.18:19.w10-w11^no one [is] good,
42.18:19.w12-w16^if not alone - god.
42.18:2.w1_2^saying,

42.20:41.w7-w11^the christ to be of david son?
42.20:42.w1-w7^himself for david says in [the] book of psalms:
42.20:42.w1^himself

42.20:43.w1-w10^until - i place the enemies of you, [as] a footstool of the feet of you.”’
42.20:44.w1-w5^david therefore lord him calls,
42.20:44.w6-w10^and how of him son is he?
42.20:45.w1-w5^were listening now all the people,
42.20:45.w6-w9^he said to the disciples of him,
42.20:46.w1-w25^beware of the scribes, - desiring to walk in long robes, and loving greetings in the marketplaces, and first seats in the synagogues, and first places in the banquets;
42.20:46.w5-w9^- desiring to walk in long robes,

42.20:47.w1-w6^who devour the houses of widows,
42.20:47.w7-w10^and as a pretext at great length pray.
42.20:47.w11-w14^these will receive more abundant condemnation.
42.20:5.w1-w6^- and they reasoned among themselves, saying
42.20:5.w6_2^saying
42.20:5.w7-w9^-, if we should say
42.20:5.w10-w11_2^from heaven,
42.20:5.w12_2^he will say,

42.20:6.w1-w3^if however we should say,
42.20:6.w4-w5_2^from men,
42.20:6.w6-w10^the people all will stone us;
42.20:6.w11_2^having been persuaded

42.20:7.w3-w5^not they knew from where.
42.20:8.w1-w5^and - jesus said to them,
42.20:8.w6-w14^neither i tell you by what authority these things i am doing.
42.20:8.w10-w14^by what authority these things i am doing.
42.20:9.w1-w9^he began then to the people to speak the parable this:
42.20:9.w3-w9^to the people to speak the parable this:
42.20:9.w10-w13^a man certain planted a vineyard,
42.20:9.w14-w17^and rented it to farmers,
42.20:9.w18-w21^and went abroad a time long.
42.21:1.w1_2^having looked up
42.21:1.w5-w11^casting into the treasury the gifts of them
42.21:10.w1-w3^then he was saying to them,
42.21:10.w4-w7^will rise up nation against nation,
42.21:10.w8-w11^and kingdom against kingdom.
42.21:11.w1-w10^earthquakes both great, and in different places famines and pestilences there will be;
42.21:11.w11-w18^fearful sights also and from heaven signs great will there be.
42.21:12.w1-w10^before however these things all, they will lay upon you the hands of them,
42.21:12.w1^before
42.21:12.w11-w18^and will persecute [you], delivering [you] to the synagogues and prisons,
42.21:12.w13-w18^delivering [you] to the synagogues and prisons,
42.21:12.w19-w27^bringing [you] before kings and governors on account of the name of me.
42.21:13.w1-w4^it will result to you for a testimony.
42.21:14.w1-w9^settle therefore in the minds of you not to premeditate to make a defense;
42.21:14.w7-w9^not to premeditate to make a defense;
42.21:14.w9_2^to make a defense;
42.21:15.w1-w7^i for will give you a mouth and wisdom,
42.21:15.w8_2^which
42.21:15.w11_2^to resist
42.21:15.w12-w13^nor to reply to
42.21:15.w15-w17^those opposing you.
42.21:16.w1-w11^you will be betrayed then even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends,
42.21:16.w12-w15^and they will put to death [some] from among you.
42.21:17.w1-w9^and you will be hated by all because of the name of me.
42.21:17.w3-w9^hated by all because of the name of me.
42.21:18.w1-w9^but a hair of the head of you no not should perish.
42.21:19.w1-w8^by the patient endurance of you, you will gain the souls of you.
42.21:2.w1-w9^he saw then a certain widow poor casting in lepta two.
42.21:2.w6-w9^casting in lepta two.
42.21:20.w1-w7^when then you see being encircled by encampments jerusalem,
42.21:20.w4-w6^being encircled by encampments
42.21:20.w8-w9^then know
42.21:20.w10-w14^that has drawn near the desolation of her.
42.21:21.w1-w9^then those in - judea, let them flee to the mountains;
42.21:21.w10-w15^and those in midst of her, let them depart out;
42.21:21.w16-w24^and those in the countries, not let them enter into her;

42.21:24.w5-w10^and will be led captive into the nations; all
42.21:24.w11-w21^and jerusalem will be trodden down by [the] gentiles, until that are fulfilled [the] times of [the] gentiles.
42.21:24.w14-w16^trodden down by [the] gentiles,
42.21:24.w17-w21^until that are fulfilled [the] times of [the] gentiles.

43.10:6.w12-w16^what it was that he was saying to them.
43.10:6.w14-w16^that he was saying to them.
43.10:7.w1-w5^said therefore again - jesus,
43.10:7.w6-w9^truly, truly, i say to you
43.10:7.w10-w16^-, i am the door of the sheep.
43.10:8.w1-w9^all who ever came before me, thieves are and robbers;
43.10:8.w2-w5^who ever came before me,
43.10:8.w6_2^thieves
43.10:8.w10-w15^but not did hear them the sheep.
43.10:9.w1-w4^i am the door;
43.10:9.w5-w9^by me if anyone enters in,
43.10:9.w10_2^he will be saved,
43.10:9.w11-w12^and he will go in
43.10:9.w13-w14^and will go out,
43.10:9.w15-w17^and pasture will find.

43.11:1.w4_2^ailing,
43.11:1.w3^a certain [man]
43.11:10.w1-w7^if however anyone walks in the night,
43.11:10.w8_2^he stumbles,
43.11:10.w9-w15^because the light not is in him.
43.11:11.w1-w2^these things he said,
43.11:11.w3-w7^and after this he says to them,
43.11:11.w8-w12^lazarus the friend of us has fallen asleep,
43.11:11.w13-w14^but i go
43.11:11.w15-w17^that i may awaken him.
43.11:12.w1-w5^said therefore the disciples of him,
43.11:12.w6-w8^lord, if he has fallen asleep,
43.11:12.w9_2^he will get well.
43.11:13.w1-w8^had spoken however - jesus of the death of him;
43.11:13.w9-w11^they however thought
43.11:13.w12-w18^that of the rest - of sleep he speaks.
43.11:14.w1-w7^then therefore said to them - jesus plainly,
43.11:14.w8-w9^lazarus has died.
43.11:15.w1-w4^and i rejoice for sake of you,
43.11:15.w5-w6^in order that you might believe,
43.11:15.w7-w10^that not i was there.
43.11:15.w11-w14^but let us go to him.

43.11:29.w5-w6^rose up quickly
43.11:29.w7-w10^and was coming to him.
43.11:3.w1-w7^sent therefore the sisters to him, saying,

43.11:31.w30-w32^that she might weep there.
43.11:32.w1-w3^- therefore mary,

43.11:32.w4-w8^when she came to where was jesus,
43.11:32.w6-w8^to where was jesus,
43.11:32.w9-w10^having seen him,

43.11:32.w18-w21^lord, if you had been here,
43.11:32.w22-w27^not - of me would have died the brother.
43.11:32.w24^of me
43.11:33.w1-w2^jesus therefore
43.11:33.w3-w12^when he saw her weeping, and the having come with her jews weeping,
43.11:33.w6_2^weeping,
43.11:33.w9-w10^having come with her
43.11:33.w12_2^weeping,
43.11:33.w13-w15^he was deeply moved - in spirit
43.11:33.w16-w18^and troubled himself.
43.11:34.w1-w2^and he said,
43.11:34.w3-w5^where have you laid him.
43.11:34.w6-w7^they say to him,
43.11:34.w8-w9^lord, come
43.11:34.w10-w11^and see.
43.11:35.w1-w3^wept - jesus.
43.11:36.w1-w4^were saying therefore the jews,
43.11:36.w5_2^behold
43.11:36.w6-w8^how he loved him!
43.11:37.w1-w5^some however of them said,
43.11:37.w1^some
43.11:37.w6-w15^not was able this [man] - having opened the eyes of the blind, to have caused
43.11:37.w9-w14^- having opened the eyes of the blind,
43.11:37.w15_2^to have caused
43.11:37.w16-w20^that also this one not should have died?
43.11:38.w1-w10^jesus therefore again, being deeply moved in himself, comes to the tomb.
43.11:38.w3-w6^again, being deeply moved in himself,
43.11:38.w11-w13^it was now a cave,
43.11:38.w14-w18^and a stone was lying against it.
43.11:39.w1-w3^says - jesus,
43.11:39.w4-w6^take away the stone.
43.11:39.w7-w13^says to him the sister of the [one] having died, martha,
43.11:39.w11-w12_2^of the [one] having died,
43.11:39.w14-w16^lord, already he stinks,
43.11:39.w17-w19^four days for it is.
43.11:4.w1_2^having heard
43.11:4.w6-w12^this - sickness not is unto death,
43.11:4.w13-w18^but for the glory - of god,
43.11:4.w19-w26^that may be glorified the son - of god by it.
43.11:40.w1-w4^says to her - jesus,
43.11:40.w5-w7^not said i to you
43.11:40.w8-w10^that if you should believe,
43.11:40.w11-w15^you will see the glory - of god?
43.11:41.w1-w4^they took away therefore the stone.
43.11:41.w5-w11^- now jesus lifted his eyes upwards
43.11:41.w5^-
43.11:41.w12-w13^and said,
43.11:41.w14-w16^father, i thank you
43.11:41.w17-w19^that you have heard me.
43.11:42.w1-w3^i and knew
43.11:42.w4-w7^that always me you hear;
43.11:42.w8-w14^but on account of the crowd - standing around i said [it],
43.11:42.w12-w13_2^- standing around
43.11:42.w15-w16^that they may believe
43.11:42.w17-w20^that you me sent.
43.11:43.w1-w6^and these things having said, in a voice loud he cried out,
43.11:43.w2-w3^these things having said,
43.11:43.w7-w9^lazarus, come forth.
43.11:44.w1-w10^came forth the [one] having been dead, being bound the feet and the hands with linen strips,
43.11:44.w2-w3_2^the [one] having been dead,
43.11:44.w4-w10^being bound the feet and the hands with linen strips,
43.11:44.w11-w16^and the face of him in a headcloth bound about.
43.11:44.w17-w20^says to them - jesus,
43.11:44.w21-w22^unbind him
43.11:44.w23-w26^and allow him to go.
43.11:44.w26_2^to go.
43.11:45.w1-w17^many therefore of the jews - having come to - mary and having seen what he did, believed in him;
43.11:45.w1^many
43.11:45.w6-w10^- having come to - mary
43.11:45.w11-w14^and having seen what he did,
43.11:45.w13-w14^what he did,
43.11:46.w1-w8^some however of them went to the pharisees
43.11:46.w1^some
43.11:46.w9-w14^and told them what had done jesus.
43.11:46.w12-w14^what had done jesus.
43.11:47.w1-w8^gathered therefore the chief priests and the pharisees a council,
43.11:47.w9-w10^and they were saying,
43.11:47.w11-w12^what are we to do?
43.11:47.w13-w19^for this - man many does signs.
43.11:47.w17^many
43.11:48.w1-w4^if we shall let him alone him like this,
43.11:48.w5-w8^all will believe in him,
43.11:48.w9-w12^and will come the romans
43.11:48.w13-w21^and will take away of us both the place and the nation.
43.11:49.w1-w13^one however certain of them, caiaphas, high priest being the year same, said to them,
43.11:49.w1_2^one
43.11:49.w7-w11^high priest being the year same,
43.11:49.w7^high priest
43.11:49.w14-w17^you not know nothing,
43.11:5.w1-w13^loved now - jesus - martha, and the sister of her, and - lazarus.
43.11:50.w1-w2^nor consider you
43.11:50.w3-w5^that it is profitable for you
43.11:50.w6-w12^that one man should die for the people,
43.11:50.w13-w18^and not all the nation should perish.
43.11:51.w1-w6^this now from himself not he said,
43.11:51.w7-w13^but high priest being the year that, he prophesied
43.11:51.w8-w12^high priest being the year that,
43.11:51.w8^high priest
43.11:51.w14-w20^that was about jesus to die for the nation,
43.11:51.w17-w20^to die for the nation,
43.11:52.w1-w6^and not for the nation only,
43.11:52.w7-w18^but that also the children - of god, those having been scattered, he might gather together into one.
43.11:52.w14-w15_2^those having been scattered,
43.11:53.w1-w6^from that therefore - day they took counsel together
43.11:53.w1-w2^from that
43.11:53.w7-w9^that they might kill him.
43.11:54.w1-w9^- therefore jesus no longer publicly walked among the jews,
43.11:54.w1^-
43.11:54.w10-w22^but went away from there into the region near the wilderness, to ephraim called a city.
43.11:54.w20-w21^ephraim called
43.11:54.w23-w27^and there he stayed with the disciples.
43.11:55.w1-w7^was now near the passover of the jews,
43.11:55.w8-w18^and went up many to jerusalem out of the region before the passover,
43.11:55.w19-w21^so that they might purify themselves.
43.11:56.w1-w4^they were seeking therefore - jesus
43.11:56.w5-w12^and were saying among one another in the temple standing,
43.11:56.w9-w12^in the temple standing,
43.11:56.w13-w15^what does it seem to you,
43.11:56.w16-w22^that no not he will come to the feast?
43.11:57.w1-w8^had given now the chief priests and the pharisees a command
43.11:57.w9-w14^that if anyone should know where he is,
43.11:57.w13-w14^where he is,
43.11:57.w15_2^he should show [it],
43.11:57.w16-w18^so that they might seize him.
43.11:6.w1-w3^when therefore he heard
43.11:6.w4-w5^that he is sick,
43.11:6.w6-w14^then indeed he remained in which he was [the] place two days.
43.11:6.w9-w12^in which he was [the] place
43.11:6.w9-w10^in which
43.11:7.w1-w6^then after this he says to the disciples,
43.11:7.w7-w11^let us go into - judea again.
43.11:8.w1-w4^say to him the disciples,
43.11:8.w5-w11^rabbi, just now were seeking you to stone the jews,
43.11:8.w8-w9^you to stone
43.11:8.w12-w15^and again you are going there?
43.11:9.w1-w2^answered jesus,
43.11:9.w3-w8^not twelve hours are there in the day?
43.11:9.w9-w14^if anyone walks in the day,
43.11:9.w15-w16^not he stumbles,
43.11:9.w17-w23^because the light the world of this he sees;
43.12:1.w1-w11^- therefore jesus, before six days the passover, came to bethany,
43.12:1.w1^-
43.12:1.w12-w14^where was lazarus,
43.12:1.w15-w19^whom had raised out from [the] dead jesus.
43.12:10.w1-w4^took counsel however the chief priests
43.12:10.w5-w9^that also - lazarus they might kill,
43.12:11.w1-w7^because many on account of him were going away of the jews
43.12:11.w2^many
43.12:11.w8-w12^and were believing in - jesus.
43.12:12.w1-13.w5^on the next day the crowd great - having come to the feast, having heard that is coming - jesus into jerusalem, took the branches of the palm trees
43.12:12.w6-w10^- having come to the feast,
43.12:12.w11_2^having heard
43.12:12.w12-w17^that is coming - jesus into jerusalem,
43.12:13.w6-w10^and went out to meet him,
43.12:13.w11-w12^and were shouting:
43.12:13.w13_2^hosanna!”
43.12:13.w14_2^blessed is
43.12:13.w15-w19^the [one] coming in [the] name of [the] lord!”
43.12:13.w20-w24^and the king - of israel!”
43.12:14.w1_2^having found
43.12:14.w9-w11^as it is written:
43.12:14.w11_2^written:
43.12:15.w1-w4^not fear, daughter of zion.
43.12:15.w5_2^behold,
43.12:15.w6-w13^the king of you comes, sitting on a colt of a donkey.”
43.12:15.w10-w13^sitting on a colt of a donkey.”
43.12:16.w1-w8^these things not knew of him the disciples from the first,
43.12:16.w9-w12^but when was glorified jesus,
43.12:16.w13-w14^then they remembered
43.12:16.w15-w20^that these things were of him written,
43.12:16.w18-w20^of him written,
43.12:16.w21-w24^and these things they had done to him.
43.12:17.w1-w8^continued to bear witness therefore the crowd - being with him
43.12:17.w5-w8^- being with him
43.12:17.w9-w15^when - lazarus he called out of the tomb
43.12:17.w16-w20^and raised him out from [the] dead.
43.12:18.w1-w7^on account of this also met him the crowd,
43.12:18.w8-w14^because they heard this of his having done the sign.
43.12:18.w10-w14^this of his having done the sign.
43.12:18.w10^this
43.12:19.w1-w6^- therefore the pharisees said among themselves,
43.12:19.w1^-
43.12:19.w7_2^you see
43.12:19.w8-w11^that not you gain nothing.
43.12:19.w12_2^behold,
43.12:19.w13-w17^the world after him has gone.
43.12:2.w1-w5^they made therefore him a supper there,
43.12:2.w6-w9^and - martha was serving,
43.12:2.w10-w19^- and lazarus one was of those reclining with him.
43.12:2.w10^-
43.12:2.w15-w19^of those reclining with him.
43.12:20.w1-w12^there were now greeks certain among those coming up that they might worship at the feast;
43.12:20.w5-w7_2^among those coming up
43.12:20.w8-w12^that they might worship at the feast;
43.12:21.w1-w9^these therefore came to philip, who was from bethsaida - of galilee,
43.12:21.w10-w13^and they were asking him saying,
43.12:21.w13_2^saying,
43.12:21.w14-w18^sir, we desire - jesus to see.
43.12:21.w16-w18^- jesus to see.
43.12:22.w1-w3^comes - philip
43.12:22.w4-w7^and tells - andrew;
43.12:22.w8-w11^come andrew and philip
43.12:22.w12-w15^and tell - jesus.
43.12:23.w1-w6^- and jesus answered them saying,
43.12:23.w1^-
43.12:23.w6_2^saying,
43.12:23.w7-w9^has come the hour
43.12:23.w10-w15^that should be glorified the son - of man.
43.12:24.w1-w4^truly, truly, i say to you,
43.12:24.w5-w15^if not the grain - of wheat, having fallen into the ground, should die,
43.12:24.w11-w14^having fallen into the ground,
43.12:24.w16-w18^it alone abides;
43.12:24.w19-w21^if however it should die,
43.12:24.w22-w24^much fruit it bears.
43.12:25.w1-w5^the [one] loving the life of him,
43.12:25.w8-w22^and the [one] hating the life of him in the world this, to life eternal will keep it.
43.12:25.w9-w17^the [one] hating the life of him in the world this,
43.12:26.w1-w4^if me anyone serves,
43.12:26.w5-w6^me let him follow;
43.12:26.w7-w10^and where am i,
43.12:26.w11-w17^there also the servant - of me will be.
43.12:26.w18-w21^if anyone me serves,
43.12:26.w22-w25^will honor him the father.
43.12:27.w1-w5^now the soul of me has been troubled,
43.12:27.w6-w8^and what shall i say?
43.12:27.w9-w15^father, save me from the hour this.’
43.12:27.w16-w23^but on account of this i came to the hour this.
43.12:28.w1-w5^father, glorify of you the name.
43.12:28.w6-w11^came therefore a voice from - heaven:
43.12:28.w12-w13^both i have glorified [it],
43.12:28.w14-w16^and again i will glorify [it].
43.12:29.w1-w10^- therefore the crowd - having stood and having heard was saying, thunder there has been.
43.12:29.w1^-
43.12:29.w4-w5_2^- having stood
43.12:29.w6-w7^and having heard
43.12:29.w9-w10^thunder there has been.
43.12:29.w11-w12^others were saying,
43.12:29.w13-w15^an angel to him has spoken.
43.12:3.w1-w14^- therefore mary, having taken a litra of fragrant oil of nard pure of great price, anointed the feet - of jesus
43.12:3.w1^-
43.12:3.w4-w9^having taken a litra of fragrant oil of nard pure of great price,
43.12:3.w15-w22^and wiped with the hair of her the feet of him;
43.12:3.w23-w31^the now house was filled with the fragrance of the oil.
43.12:3.w23^the
43.12:30.w1-w2^answered jesus
43.12:30.w3-w4^and said
43.12:30.w5-w11^not because of me the voice this has come,
43.12:30.w12-w14^but because of you.
43.12:31.w1-w6^now [the] judgment is the world of this;
43.12:31.w2^[the] judgment
43.12:31.w7-w14^now the prince of the world this will be cast out.
43.12:32.w1_2^and i,
43.12:32.w2-w6^if i am lifted up from the earth,
43.12:32.w7-w10^all will draw to myself.
43.12:33.w1-w8^this now he was saying, signifying by what death he was about to die.
43.12:33.w4-w8^signifying by what death he was about to die.
43.12:33.w5-w6_2^by what death
43.12:34.w1-w5^answered then him the crowd,
43.12:34.w6-w10^we have heard from the law
43.12:34.w11-w17^that the christ abides to the age,
43.12:34.w18-w21^and how say you
43.12:34.w22-w28^that it behooves to be lifted up the son - of man?
43.12:34.w24-w28^to be lifted up the son - of man?
43.12:34.w29-w35^who is this - son - of man?
43.12:35.w1-w5^said therefore to them - jesus,
43.12:35.w6-w13^yet a little while the light with you is.
43.12:35.w14_2^walk
43.12:35.w15-w18^while the light you have,
43.12:35.w19-w23^so that not darkness you might overtake.
43.12:35.w24-w33^and the [one] walking in the darkness not knows where he is going.
43.12:35.w25-w29^the [one] walking in the darkness
43.12:35.w32-w33^where he is going.
43.12:36.w1-w4^while the light you have,
43.12:36.w5-w8^believe in the light,
43.12:36.w9-w12^so that sons of light you may become.
43.12:36.w13-w15^these things spoke jesus,
43.12:36.w16-w20^and having gone away, he was hidden from them.
43.12:36.w17_2^having gone away,
43.12:37.w1-w7^so many however of him signs having been done before them,
43.12:37.w1^so many
43.12:37.w8-w11^not they believed in him,
43.12:38.w1-w7^so that the word of isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled
43.12:38.w8-w9^that said:
43.12:38.w10-w15^lord, who has believed the report of us?
43.12:38.w16-w21^and the arm of [the] lord to whom has been revealed?”
43.12:39.w1-w5^because of this, not they were able to believe,
43.12:39.w5_2^to believe,
43.12:39.w6-w9^for again said isaiah:
43.12:4.w1-w14^says however judas - iscariot, one of the disciples of him, - being about him to betray,
43.12:4.w11-w14^- being about him to betray,
43.12:4.w13-w14^him to betray,
43.12:40.w1-w4^he has blinded of them the eyes,
43.12:40.w5-w9^and has hardened of them the heart,
43.12:40.w10-w14^that not they should see with the eyes,
43.12:40.w15-w18^and understand with the heart,
43.12:40.w19-w20^and turn,
43.12:40.w21-w23^and i will heal them.”
43.12:41.w1-w3^these things said isaiah
43.12:41.w4-w8^because he saw the glory of him
43.12:41.w9-w12^and spoke concerning him.
43.12:42.w1-w10^nevertheless, indeed even of the rulers many believed in him;
43.12:42.w11-w16^but on account of the pharisees not they were confessing,
43.12:42.w17-w20^so that not put out of the synagogue they might be;
43.12:43.w1-w6^they loved for the glory - of men
43.12:43.w7-w12^more than the glory - of god.
43.12:44.w1-w3^jesus then cried out
43.12:44.w4-w5^and said,
43.12:44.w6-w9^the [one] believing in me,
43.12:44.w14-w18^but in the [one] having sent me;
43.12:44.w15-w18^in the [one] having sent me;
43.12:45.w1-w8^and the [one] beholding me, beholds the [one] having sent me.
43.12:45.w2-w4^the [one] beholding me,
43.12:45.w6-w8^the [one] having sent me.
43.12:46.w1-w6^i a light into the world have come,
43.12:46.w7-w17^so that everyone - believing in me, in the darkness not should abide.
43.12:46.w8-w12^everyone - believing in me,
43.12:47.w1-w7^and if anyone of me hears the words
43.12:47.w4^of me
43.12:47.w8-w10^and not keeps [them],
43.12:47.w11-w14^i not do judge him,
43.12:47.w15-w17^not for i came
43.12:47.w18-w21^that i might judge the world,
43.12:47.w22-w26^but that i might save the world.
43.12:48.w1-w3^the [one] rejecting me
43.12:48.w4-w9^and not receiving the words of me
43.12:48.w11-w13^[one] judging him:
43.12:48.w14-w17_2^the word which i spoke,
43.12:48.w16-w17^which i spoke,
43.12:48.w18-w24^that will judge him in the last day.
43.12:49.w1-w6^for i from myself not spoke,
43.12:49.w7-w20^but the having sent me father himself, me a commandment gave what i should say and what i should speak.
43.12:49.w9-w10^having sent me
43.12:49.w16-w17^what i should say
43.12:49.w18-w20^and what i should speak.
43.12:5.w1-w9^because of why this - fragrant oil not was sold for three hundred denarii
43.12:5.w10-w12^and given to [the] poor?
43.12:50.w1-w2^and i know
43.12:50.w3-w9^that the commandment of him life eternal is.
43.12:50.w10-w13^what therefore i speak,
43.12:50.w14-w18^as has said to me the father,
43.12:50.w19-w20^so i speak.
43.12:6.w1-w3^he said however this,
43.12:6.w4-w10^not because for the poor he was caring to him,
43.12:6.w11-w14^but because a thief he was,
43.12:6.w15-w21^and the money bag having, that being put into [it] he used to pilfer.
43.12:6.w16-w18^the money bag having,
43.12:6.w19-w20_2^that being put into [it]
43.12:7.w1-w4^said therefore - jesus,
43.12:7.w5-w6^leave alone her,
43.12:7.w7-w15^so that for the day of the burial of me she may keep it;
43.12:8.w1-w7^the poor for always you have with you;
43.12:8.w8-w12^me however not always you have.
43.12:9.w1-w8^knew therefore - a crowd great of the jews
43.12:9.w9-w11^that there he is;
43.12:9.w12-w18^and they came, not because of - jesus only,
43.12:9.w19-w24^but that also - lazarus they might see,
43.12:9.w25-w28^whom he had raised out from [the] dead.
43.13:1.w1-w34^before now the feast of the passover, knowing - jesus that had come his - hour, that he would depart out of the world this to the father, having loved the own who [were] in the world, to [the] end he loved them.
43.13:1.w1^before
43.13:1.w7_2^knowing
43.13:1.w10-w14^that had come his - hour,
43.13:1.w15-w23^that he would depart out of the world this to the father,
43.13:1.w24-w30^having loved the own who [were] in the world,
43.13:10.w1-w4^says to him - jesus,
43.13:10.w5-w6_2^the [one] having been bathed
43.13:10.w10-w14^if not the feet to wash,
43.13:10.w12-w14^the feet to wash,
43.13:10.w15-w18^but is clean wholly;
43.13:10.w19-w22^and you all clean are,
43.13:10.w23-w25^but not all.
43.13:11.w1-w5^he knew for the [one who] was betraying him;
43.13:11.w3-w5^the [one who] was betraying him;
43.13:11.w6-w8^on account of this he said
43.13:11.w9-w13^-, not all clean you are.
43.13:12.w1-w6^when therefore he had washed the feet of them
43.13:12.w7-w11^and taken the garments of him,
43.13:12.w12-w14^and having reclined again,
43.13:12.w15-w16^he said to them,
43.13:12.w17-w20^do you know what i have done to you?
43.13:12.w18-w20^what i have done to you?
43.13:13.w1-w8^you call me - teacher and - lord,
43.13:13.w4-w8_2^- teacher and - lord,
43.13:13.w9-w11^and rightly you say,
43.13:13.w12-w13^i am for.
43.13:14.w1-w12^if therefore i have washed your - feet, the lord and the teacher,
43.13:14.w3^i
43.13:14.w13-w19^also you ought of one another to wash the feet.
43.13:14.w16-w19^of one another to wash the feet.
43.13:14.w16^of one another
43.13:15.w1-w4^a pattern for i gave you,
43.13:15.w5-w9^that as i did to you,
43.13:15.w10-w12^also you should do.
43.13:16.w1-w4^truly, truly, i say to you,
43.13:16.w5-w11^not is a servant greater than the master of him,
43.13:16.w12-w17^nor a messenger greater than the [one] having sent him.
43.13:16.w15-w17^the [one] having sent him.
43.13:17.w1-w3^if these things you know,
43.13:17.w4-w5^blessed are you
43.13:17.w6-w8^if you do them.
43.13:18.w1-w5^not about all of you i speak.
43.13:18.w6-w9^i know whom i chose,
43.13:18.w8-w9^whom i chose,
43.13:18.w10-w14^but that the scripture may be fulfilled:
43.13:18.w15-w19^the [one] eating of me the bread
43.13:19.w1-w7^from this time i am telling you before - it comes to pass,
43.13:19.w5-w7_2^before - it comes to pass,
43.13:19.w8-w9^so that you should believe
43.13:19.w10-w11^when it comes to pass,
43.13:19.w12-w14^that i am [he].
43.13:2.w1-w3^and supper taking place,
43.13:2.w4-w10^the devil already having put into the heart
43.13:2.w11-w16^that he should betray him of judas, [son] of simon iscariot,
43.13:20.w1-w4^truly, truly, i say to you,
43.13:20.w5-w9^the [one] receiving - any i shall send,
43.13:20.w7-w9^- any i shall send,
43.13:20.w12_2^the [one]

43.13:21.w16-w21^that one of you will betray me.
43.13:22.w1-w9^began to look upon one another the disciples, being uncertain of whom he is speaking.
43.13:22.w6-w9^being uncertain of whom he is speaking.
43.13:22.w7-w9^of whom he is speaking.
43.13:23.w1-w12^there was reclining one of the disciples of him in the bosom - of jesus,
43.13:23.w2_2^reclining
43.13:23.w13-w16^whom loved - jesus.
43.13:24.w1-w12^motions therefore to him simon peter to ask who it is about whom he is speaking?

43.13:38.w13-w16^no not [the] rooster will crow,
43.13:38.w17-w21^until that you will deny me three times.
43.13:4.w5-w8^and lays aside the garments.
43.13:4.w9-w13^and having taken a towel, he girded himself.

43.15:1.w1-w6^i am the vine - true,

43.15:14.w7-w10^what i command you.
43.15:15.w1-w4^no longer i call you servants,
43.15:15.w5-w14^for the servant not knows what is doing his - master.
43.15:15.w10-w14^what is doing his - master.
43.15:15.w15-w18^you however i have called friends,
43.15:15.w19-w28^because all things that i heard from the father of me, i have made known to you.
43.15:15.w21-w26^that i heard from the father of me,
43.15:16.w1-w4^not you me chose,
43.15:16.w5-w8^but i chose you,
43.15:16.w9-w11^and appointed you
43.15:16.w12-w14^that you should go
43.15:16.w15-w17^and fruit you should bear,
43.15:16.w18-w22^and the fruit of you should remain;
43.15:16.w23-w35^so that whatever - you might ask the father in the name of me, he may give you.
43.15:16.w24-w33^whatever - you might ask the father in the name of me,
43.15:17.w1-w3^these things i command you,
43.15:17.w4-w6^that you love one another.
43.15:18.w1-w5^if the world you hates,
43.15:18.w6_2^you know
43.15:18.w7-w11^that me before you it has hated.
43.15:19.w1-w5^if of the world you were,
43.15:19.w6-w11^the world - [as] its own would love [you];
43.15:19.w12-w18^because however of the world not you are,
43.15:19.w19-w25^but i chose you out of the world,
43.15:19.w26-w31^on account of this hates you the world.
43.15:2.w1-w7_2^every branch in me not bearing fruit,
43.15:2.w5-w7^not bearing fruit,
43.15:2.w8-w9^he takes away it;
43.15:2.w10-w14^and every one - fruit bearing,
43.15:2.w11-w14^every one - fruit bearing,
43.15:2.w11-w12^every one -
43.15:2.w15-w16^he prunes it,
43.15:2.w17-w20^that fruit more it may bear.
43.15:20.w1-w7^remember the word that i said to you:
43.15:20.w4-w7^that i said to you:
43.15:20.w8-w14^not is a servant greater than the master of him.
43.15:20.w15-w17^if me they persecuted,
43.15:20.w18-w20^also you they will persecute;
43.15:20.w21-w25^if the word of me they kept,
43.15:20.w26-w29^also - yours they will keep.
43.15:21.w1-w10^but these things all they will do against you on account of the name of me,
43.15:21.w11-w16^because not they have known the [one] having sent me.
43.15:21.w14-w16^the [one] having sent me.
43.15:22.w1-w3^if not i had come
43.15:22.w4-w6^and spoken to them,
43.15:22.w7-w9^sin not they would have had;
43.15:22.w10-w18^now however excuse not they have for the sin of them.
43.15:23.w1-w3^the [one] me hating,
43.15:23.w1_2^the [one]
43.15:24.w1-w11^if the works not i had done among them that no other has done,
43.15:24.w8-w11^that no other has done,
43.15:24.w12-w14^sin not they would have had;
43.15:24.w15-w18^now however both they have seen
43.15:24.w19-w26^and have hated both me and the father of me.
43.15:25.w1-w11^but [this is] that may be fulfilled the word - in the law of them having been written
43.15:25.w6-w11^- in the law of them having been written
43.15:25.w6^-
43.15:25.w12-w15^-: they hated me without cause.’
43.15:26.w1-w15^when comes the helper, whom i will send to you from the father, the spirit - of truth,
43.15:26.w5-w11^whom i will send to you from the father,
43.15:26.w16-w20^who from the father goes forth,
43.15:26.w21-w24^he will bear witness concerning me.
43.15:27.w1-w4^also you now bear witness,
43.15:27.w5-w10^because from [the] beginning with me you are.
43.15:3.w1-w10^already you clean are by reason of the word that i have spoken to you.
43.15:3.w8-w10^that i have spoken to you.
43.15:4.w1-w3^abide in me,
43.15:4.w4-w6^and i in you.
43.15:4.w7-w15^as the branch not is able fruit to bear of itself,
43.15:4.w12-w15^fruit to bear of itself,
43.15:4.w16-w21^if not it abide in the vine,
43.15:4.w22-w24^so neither [can] you,
43.15:4.w25-w29^if not in me you abide.
43.15:5.w1-w4^i am the vine;
43.15:5.w5-w7^you [are] the branches.
43.15:5.w8-w11^the [one] abiding in me,
43.15:5.w12-w14^and i in him,
43.15:5.w15-w18^he bears fruit much.
43.15:5.w19-w25^for apart from me not you are able to do nothing.
43.15:5.w24-w25^to do nothing.
43.15:6.w1-w6^if not anyone abide in me,
43.15:6.w7-w8^he is thrown out
43.15:6.w9-w11^like the branch
43.15:6.w12-w13^and is dried up,
43.15:6.w14-w16^and they gather them
43.15:6.w17-w21^and into the fire cast,
43.15:6.w22-w23^and it is burned.
43.15:7.w1-w4^if you abide in me
43.15:7.w5-w11^and the words of me in you abide,
43.15:7.w12-w14^whatever if you wish,
43.15:7.w16-w18^and it will come to pass to you.
43.15:8.w1-w6^in this is glorified the father of me,
43.15:8.w7-w10^that fruit much you should bear,
43.15:8.w11-w14^and you shall be to me disciples.
43.15:9.w1-w5^as has loved me the father,
43.15:9.w6-w8^i also you have loved.
43.15:9.w9-w14^abide in the love - of me.
43.16:1.w1-w3^these things i have spoken to you
43.16:1.w4-w6^that not you might fall away.
43.16:10.w1-w3^concerning righteousness now,
43.16:10.w4-w8^because to the father i go away,
43.16:10.w9-w12^and no more you behold me;
43.16:11.w1-w3^concerning now judgment,
43.16:11.w1^concerning
43.16:11.w4-w10^because the ruler of the world this has been judged.
43.16:12.w1-w5^yet many things i have to you to say,
43.16:12.w2_2^many things
43.16:12.w6-w10^but not you are able to bear them now.
43.16:12.w9-w10^to bear them now.
43.16:13.w1-w8^when however shall come he, the spirit - of truth,
43.16:13.w9-w14^he will guide you into the truth all;
43.16:13.w15-w19^not for he will speak from himself,
43.16:13.w20-w23^but whatever he may hear, he will speak;
43.16:13.w21-w22^whatever he may hear,
43.16:13.w24-w28^and the things coming he will declare to you.
43.16:13.w25-w26_2^the things coming
43.16:14.w1-w3^he me will glorify,
43.16:14.w4-w8^for from that which [is] mine he will take,
43.16:14.w9-w11^and will disclose to you.
43.16:15.w1-w7^all things whatever has the father, mine are;
43.16:15.w2-w5^whatever has the father,
43.16:15.w8-w10^because of this, i said
43.16:15.w11-w15^that from that which [is] mine he will take
43.16:15.w16-w18^and will disclose to you.
43.16:16.w1_2^a little [while]
43.16:16.w2-w5^and no longer you do behold me;
43.16:16.w6-w8^and again a little [while]
43.16:16.w9-w11^and you will see me.”
43.16:17.w1-w8^said therefore [some] of the disciples of him to one another,
43.16:17.w9-w11^what is this

43.16:19.w6-w7^him to ask,
43.16:19.w8-w10^and he said to them,
43.16:19.w11-w15^concerning this do you inquire among one another
43.16:19.w16-w17^that i said,
43.16:19.w18_2^a little [while]
43.16:19.w19-w22^and not you do behold me,
43.16:19.w23-w25^and again a little [while]

43.16:2.w1-w3^out of the synagogues they will put you;
43.16:2.w4-w6^but is coming an hour
43.16:2.w7-w16^that everyone - having killed you will think [it is] a service to offer - to god.

43.16:21.w3-w4^when she is giving birth,
43.16:21.w5-w6^pain has,
43.16:21.w7-w11^because has come the hour of her;
43.16:21.w12-w16^when however she brings forth the child,
43.16:21.w17-w23^no longer she remembers the tribulation, on account of the joy
43.16:21.w24-w29^that has been born a man into the world.

43.16:27.w1-w6^himself for the father loves you,
43.16:27.w1^himself
43.16:27.w7-w10^because you me have loved

43.16:27.w13-w18^that i from - god came forth.
43.16:28.w1-w4^i came forth from the father
43.16:28.w5-w9^and have come into the world;
43.16:28.w10-w13^again i leave the world

43.16:29.w1-w4^say the disciples of him,
43.16:29.w5_2^behold,
43.16:29.w6-w9^now in openness you speak,
43.16:29.w10-w13^and allegory not speak.
43.16:3.w1-w3^and these things they will do,
43.16:3.w4-w10^because not they know the father, nor me.
43.16:30.w1-w2^now we know
43.16:30.w3-w5^that you know all things,
43.16:30.w6-w9^and not need have
43.16:30.w10-w13^that anyone you should ask.
43.16:30.w14-w16^in this we believe
43.16:30.w17-w20^that from god you came forth.

43.16:32.w2-w3^is coming an hour,
43.16:32.w4-w5^and has come,
43.16:32.w6-w11^when you will be scattered, each to the own,
43.16:32.w12-w14^and i alone you shall leave;
43.16:32.w15-w18^yet not i am alone,

43.16:33.w16-w19^i have overcome the world.
43.16:4.w1-w4^but these things i have said to you,
43.16:4.w5-w10^so that when might have come the hour of them,
43.16:4.w11-w12^you may remember them,
43.16:4.w13-w16^that i said [them] to you.
43.16:4.w17-w23^these things now to you from [the] beginning not i said,
43.16:4.w24-w27^because with you i was.

43.16:8.w2_2^having come,
43.16:9.w1-w3^concerning sin indeed,
43.16:9.w4-w8^because not do they believe in me;
43.17:1.w1-w3^these things spoke jesus,
43.17:1.w4-w12^and having lifted up the eyes of him to - heaven, he said,
43.17:1.w5-w11^having lifted up the eyes of him to - heaven,

43.18:23.w14-w16^why me strike you?
43.18:24.w1-w10^sent then him - annas, bound, to caiaphas the high priest.
43.18:24.w6_2^bound,
43.18:25.w1-w7^was now simon peter standing and warming himself.
43.18:25.w5_2^standing
43.18:25.w6-w7^and warming himself.
43.18:25.w8-w10^they said therefore to him,
43.18:25.w11-w18^not also you of the disciples of him are?
43.18:25.w19-w20^denied he
43.18:25.w21-w22^and said,
43.18:25.w23-w24^not i am.
43.18:26.w1-w14^says one of the servants of the high priest, kinsman being [of him] of whom had cut off peter the ear,
43.18:26.w8-w9^kinsman being [of him]
43.18:26.w10-w14^of whom had cut off peter the ear,
43.18:26.w10^of whom
43.18:26.w15-w23^not i you saw in the garden with him?
43.18:26.w17^you
43.18:27.w1-w4^again then denied peter,
43.18:27.w5-w8^and immediately a rooster crowed.
43.18:28.w1-w10^they are leading then - jesus from - caiaphas into the praetorium.
43.18:28.w11-w13^it was now early,
43.18:28.w14-w20^and they not entered into the praetorium
43.18:28.w21-w23^so that not they should be defiled,
43.18:28.w24-w27^but might eat the passover.
43.18:29.w1-w7^went therefore - pilate out to them
43.18:29.w8-w9^and said,
43.18:29.w10-w16^what accusation bring you against the man this?
43.18:3.w1-w23^- therefore judas, having procured the cohort and from the chief priests and from the pharisees officers, comes there with lanterns, and torches, and weapons.
43.18:3.w1^-
43.18:3.w4-w15^having procured the cohort and from the chief priests and from the pharisees officers,
43.18:30.w1_2^they answered
43.18:30.w2-w4^and said to him,
43.18:30.w5-w10^if not were he evil doing,
43.18:30.w9-w10^evil doing,
43.18:30.w11-w15^not - to you we would have delivered him.
43.18:31.w1-w5^said therefore to them - pilate,
43.18:31.w6-w8^take him yourselves
43.18:31.w9-w15^and according to the law of you judge him.
43.18:31.w16-w19^said to him the jews,
43.18:31.w20-w24^to us not it is permitted to put to death no one
43.18:31.w23-w24^to put to death no one
43.18:32.w1-w6^that the word - of jesus might be fulfilled,
43.18:32.w7-w13^which he had spoken, signifying what death he was about to die.
43.18:32.w9-w13^signifying what death he was about to die.
43.18:32.w10-w11_2^what death
43.18:33.w1-w8^entered therefore again into the praetorium - pilate,
43.18:33.w9-w12^and he called - jesus
43.18:33.w13-w15^and said to him,
43.18:33.w16-w21^you are the king of the jews?
43.18:34.w1-w2^answered jesus,
43.18:34.w3-w7^of yourself you this say,
43.18:34.w8-w13^or others did say [it] to you concerning me?
43.18:35.w1-w3^answered - pilate,
43.18:35.w4-w7^not i a jew am?
43.18:35.w8-w17^the nation - of you and the chief priests delivered you to me.
43.18:35.w18-w19^what have you done?
43.18:36.w1-w2^answered jesus,
43.18:36.w3-w12^the kingdom - my not is of the world this;
43.18:36.w13-w22^if of the world this were - kingdom - my,
43.18:36.w23-w28^- attendants - my would fight -
43.18:36.w29-w33^that not i might be betrayed to the jews.
43.18:36.w34-w42^now however - kingdom - my not is from here.
43.18:37.w1-w5^said therefore to him - pilate,
43.18:37.w6-w9^then a king are you?
43.18:37.w10-w12^answered - jesus,
43.18:37.w13-w14^you say
43.18:37.w15-w18^that a king i am. i
43.18:37.w19-w21^for this have been born,
43.18:37.w22-w28^and for this i have come into the world,
43.18:37.w29-w32^that i may bear witness to the truth.
43.18:37.w33-w38^everyone - being of the truth
43.18:38.w1-w4^says to him - pilate,
43.18:38.w5-w7^what is truth?
43.18:38.w8-w15^and this having said, again he went out to the jews
43.18:38.w9-w10^this having said,
43.18:38.w16-w18^and says to them,
43.18:38.w19-w24^i no find in him guilt.
43.18:38.w20^no
43.18:39.w1-w4^it is however a custom with you
43.18:39.w5-w11^that one i should release to you at the passover;
43.18:39.w12-w19^wish you therefore i should release to you the king of the jews?
43.18:39.w14-w19^i should release to you the king of the jews?
43.18:4.w1-w9^jesus therefore, knowing all things that are coming upon him, having gone forth
43.18:4.w3-w8^knowing all things that are coming upon him,
43.18:4.w4-w8^all things that are coming upon him,
43.18:4.w10-w12^also said to them,
43.18:4.w13-w14^whom seek you?
43.18:40.w1-w4^they cried out then again saying,
43.18:40.w4_2^saying,
43.18:40.w5-w6^not this one,
43.18:40.w7-w9^but - barabbas!
43.18:40.w10-w14^was now - barabbas an insurrectionist.
43.18:5.w1-w2^they answered him,
43.18:5.w3-w5_2^jesus of nazareth.
43.18:5.w6-w7^he says to them,
43.18:5.w8-w9^i am [he].
43.18:5.w10-w18^had been standing now also judas, who is delivering up him, with them.
43.18:5.w14-w16^who is delivering up him,
43.18:6.w1-w4^when therefore he said to them,
43.18:6.w5-w6^i am [he],
43.18:6.w7-w10^they drew toward the back
43.18:6.w11-w13^and fell to [the] ground.
43.18:7.w1-w4^again therefore he questioned them,
43.18:7.w5-w6^whom seek you?
43.18:7.w7-w9^- and they said,
43.18:7.w10-w12_2^jesus of nazareth.
43.18:8.w1-w2^answered jesus,
43.18:8.w3-w4^i have told you
43.18:8.w5-w7^that i am [he].
43.18:8.w8-w11^if therefore me you seek,
43.18:8.w12-w14^allow these to go away,
43.18:8.w14_2^to go away,
43.18:9.w1-w6^so that might be fulfilled the word that he had spoken
43.18:9.w5-w6^that he had spoken
43.18:9.w7-w15^-, those whom you have given me, not i lost of them not one.
43.18:9.w8-w10^those whom you have given me,
43.18:9.w8-w10_2^those whom you have given me,
43.19:1.w1-w7^at that time therefore took - pilate - jesus
43.19:1.w8-w9^and flogged [him].
43.19:10.w1-w5^says therefore to him - pilate,
43.19:10.w6-w8^to me not speak you?
43.19:10.w9-w10^not know you
43.19:10.w11-w15^that authority i have to release you,
43.19:10.w14-w15^to release you,
43.19:10.w16-w20^and authority i have to crucify you?
43.19:10.w19-w20^to crucify you?
43.19:11.w1-w3^answered him jesus,
43.19:11.w4-w9^not you would have authority also me against,
43.19:11.w6^authority
43.19:11.w10-w15^if not it were given to you from above.
43.19:11.w13-w15^given to you from above.
43.19:11.w16-w24^because of this, the [one] having delivered up me to you, greater sin has.
43.19:11.w18-w21^the [one] having delivered up me to you,
43.19:12.w1-w7^out of this - pilate was seeking to release him;
43.19:12.w6-w7^to release him;
43.19:12.w8-w12^- but the jews cried out, saying,
43.19:12.w8^-
43.19:12.w12_2^saying,
43.19:12.w13-w15^if this [man] you release,
43.19:12.w16-w20^not you are a friend - of caesar.
43.19:12.w21-w25^everyone - a king himself making,
43.19:12.w21-w22^everyone -
43.19:13.w1-w11^- therefore pilate, having heard the words these, brought out - jesus,
43.19:13.w1^-
43.19:13.w4-w7^having heard the words these,
43.19:13.w12-w19^and sat down upon [the] judgment seat at a place called [the] stone pavement;
43.19:13.w18-w19^called [the] stone pavement;
43.19:13.w20-w22^in hebrew now, gabbatha.
43.19:14.w1-w5^it was now the day of preparation of the passover;
43.19:14.w6-w9^[the] hour was about the sixth.
43.19:14.w10-w13^and he says to the jews,
43.19:14.w14_2^behold
43.19:14.w15-w17_2^the king of you!
43.19:15.w1-w3^they cried out therefore, with him
43.19:15.w4_2^away,
43.19:15.w5_2^away!
43.19:15.w6-w7^crucify him!
43.19:15.w8-w11^says to them - pilate,
43.19:15.w12-w15^the king of you shall i crucify?
43.19:15.w16-w18^answered the chief priests,
43.19:15.w19-w21^not we have a king,
43.19:15.w22-w24^if not caesar.
43.19:16.w1-w5^then therefore he delivered him to them,
43.19:16.w6-w7^that he might be crucified.
43.19:16.w8-w11^they took therefore - jesus.
43.19:17.w1-w11^and bearing [his] own - cross, he went out to the called of the skull place,
43.19:17.w2-w5^bearing [his] own - cross,
43.19:17.w7-w11^to the called of the skull place,
43.19:17.w12-w15^which is called in hebrew golgotha,
43.19:18.w1-w3^where him they crucified,
43.19:18.w4-w11^and with him others two, on this side and on that side,
43.19:18.w12-w15^in between now - jesus.
43.19:19.w1-w6^wrote then also a title - pilate
43.19:19.w7-w11^and put [it] on the cross.
43.19:19.w12-w14^it was now written:
43.19:19.w14_2^written:
43.19:19.w15-w21_2^jesus of nazareth, the king of the jews.
43.19:2.w1-w11^and the soldiers, having twisted together a crown of thorns, put [it] on of him the head,
43.19:2.w4-w7^having twisted together a crown of thorns,
43.19:2.w12-w16^and a robe purple cast around him,
43.19:20.w1-w8^this therefore the title many read of the jews,
43.19:20.w1^this
43.19:20.w5^many
43.19:20.w9-w15^for near was the place, the city,
43.19:20.w10^near
43.19:20.w16-w19^where was crucified - jesus,
43.19:20.w20-w25^and it was written in hebrew, in latin, in greek.
43.19:20.w22-w25^written in hebrew, in latin, in greek.
43.19:21.w1-w8^were saying therefore - to pilate the chief priests of the jews,
43.19:21.w9-w10^not write,
43.19:21.w11-w14_2^the king of the jews,
43.19:21.w15-w18^but that he said,
43.19:21.w19-w22^king i am of the jews.
43.19:21.w19^king
43.19:22.w1-w3^answered - pilate,
43.19:22.w4-w5^what i have written,
43.19:23.w1-w3^the then soldiers,
43.19:23.w1^the
43.19:23.w4-w7^when they crucified - jesus,
43.19:23.w8-w11^took the garments of him
43.19:23.w12-w15^and made four parts,
43.19:23.w16-w18^to each soldier a part,
43.19:23.w19-w21^and also the tunic.
43.19:23.w22-w32^was now the tunic seamless, from the top woven throughout all.
43.19:23.w27-w29_2^from the top
43.19:24.w1-w4^they said therefore to one another,
43.19:24.w5-w7^not let us tear up it,
43.19:24.w8-w11^but let us cast lots for it,
43.19:24.w12-w13^whose it will be,
43.19:24.w14-w19^that the scripture might be fulfilled that said:
43.19:24.w18-w19_2^that said:
43.19:24.w20-w24^they divided the garments of me among them,
43.19:24.w25-w31^and for the clothing of me they cast a lot.”
43.19:24.w32-w37^the indeed therefore soldiers these things did.
43.19:24.w32^the
43.19:25.w1-w24^had been standing now by the cross - of jesus the mother of him, and the sister of the mother of him, mary the [wife] - of clopas, and mary - magdalene.
43.19:26.w1-w11^jesus therefore, having seen [his] mother and the disciple standing by whom he loved,
43.19:26.w3-w11^having seen [his] mother and the disciple standing by whom he loved,
43.19:26.w9_2^standing by
43.19:26.w10-w11^whom he loved,
43.19:26.w12-w14^says to [his] mother,
43.19:26.w15-w16^woman, behold,
43.19:26.w17-w19_2^the son of you.
43.19:27.w1-w4^then he says to the disciple,
43.19:27.w5_2^behold
43.19:27.w6-w8_2^the mother of you.
43.19:27.w9-w20^and from that - hour took the disciple her to the own.
43.19:28.w1-w14^after this, knowing - jesus that now all things had been accomplished, so that might be fulfilled the scripture, he says,
43.19:28.w3_2^knowing
43.19:28.w6-w9^that now all things had been accomplished,
43.19:28.w10-w13^so that might be fulfilled the scripture,
43.19:28.w15_2^i thirst.
43.19:29.w1-w4^a vessel had been set [there] of sour wine full;
43.19:29.w1^a vessel
43.19:29.w5_2^a sponge
43.19:3.w1-w4^and they began coming up to him
43.19:3.w5-w6^and saying,
43.19:3.w7-w11^hail, - king of the jews!
43.19:3.w12-w15^and they kept giving him blows with the palm.
43.19:30.w1-w5^when therefore took the sour wine
43.19:30.w6-w8^- jesus, he said,
43.19:30.w9_2^it has been finished.
43.19:30.w10-w16^and having bowed the head, he yielded up the spirit.
43.19:30.w11-w13^having bowed the head,
43.19:31.w1-w3^- therefore the jews,
43.19:31.w1^-
43.19:31.w4-w6^because [the] preparation it was,
43.19:31.w7-w17^so that not would remain on the cross the bodies on the sabbath —
43.19:31.w18-w25^was for a high - day that - sabbath —
43.19:31.w26-w28^asked - pilate
43.19:31.w29-w33^that might be broken their - legs,
43.19:31.w34-w35^and they might be taken away.
43.19:32.w1-w4^came therefore the soldiers,
43.19:32.w5-w17^and of the indeed first broke the legs, and of the other - having been crucified with him;
43.19:32.w6_3^of the
43.19:32.w8_3^first
43.19:32.w15-w17^- having been crucified with him;
43.19:33.w1_2^to
43.19:33.w6-w10^when they saw already him having been dead,
43.19:34.w1-w9^but one of the soldiers with a spear his - side pierced,
43.19:34.w10-w15^and came out immediately blood and water.
43.19:35.w1-w4^and the [one] having seen has borne witness,
43.19:35.w2-w3_2^the [one] having seen
43.19:35.w5-w10^and true of him is the testimony.
43.19:35.w7^of him
43.19:35.w11-w13^and he knows
43.19:35.w14-w16^that truth he is speaking,
43.19:35.w17-w20^that also you might believe.
43.19:36.w1-w3^took place for these things
43.19:36.w4-w7^so that the scripture might be fulfilled:
43.19:36.w8-w11^bone not one will be broken of him.”
43.19:36.w8^bone
43.19:37.w1-w5^and again, another scripture says:
43.19:37.w6-w9^they will look on the [one] they have pierced.”
43.19:37.w7-w9^on the [one] they have pierced.”
43.19:38.w1-w21^after then these things, asked - pilate joseph - from arimathea, being a disciple - of jesus — concealed however through the fear of the jews —
43.19:38.w1^after
43.19:38.w11-w14^being a disciple - of jesus —
43.19:38.w15-w21^concealed however through the fear of the jews —
43.19:38.w22-w27^that he might take away the body - of jesus;
43.19:38.w28-w31^and gave permission - pilate.
43.19:38.w32-w33^he came therefore
43.19:38.w34-w38^and took away the body of him.
43.19:39.w1-w19^came now also nicodemus, the [one] having come to him by night at the first, bearing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about litras a hundred.
43.19:39.w5-w11^the [one] having come to him by night at the first,
43.19:39.w12-w19^bearing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about litras a hundred.
43.19:4.w1-w6^and went forth again outside - pilate,
43.19:4.w7-w9^and he says to them,
43.19:4.w10_2^behold,
43.19:4.w11-w14^i bring to you him out,
43.19:4.w15-w16^so that you may know
43.19:4.w17-w22^that no guilt i find in him.
43.19:40.w1-w6^they took therefore the body - of jesus
43.19:40.w7-w13^and bound it in linen cloths, with the spices,
43.19:40.w14-w19^as [the] custom is among the jews to prepare for burial.
43.19:40.w19_2^to prepare for burial.
43.19:41.w1-w8^there was now in the place where he was crucified a garden,
43.19:41.w6-w7^where he was crucified
43.19:41.w9-w14^and in the garden a tomb new,
43.19:41.w15-w16_2^in which
43.19:42.w1-w15^there therefore, on account of the preparation of the jews, because near was the tomb, they laid - jesus.
43.19:42.w8-w12^because near was the tomb,
43.19:5.w1-w13^went forth therefore - jesus outside, wearing the thorny crown and the purple robe.
43.19:5.w6-w13^wearing the thorny crown and the purple robe.
43.19:5.w14-w16^and he says to them,
43.19:5.w17_2^behold
43.19:5.w18-w19_2^the man!

43.19:7.w1-w4^answered him the jews,
43.19:7.w5-w7^we a law have,
43.19:7.w8-w13^and according to the law, he ought to die,
43.19:7.w13_2^to die,
43.19:7.w14-w18^because [the] son of god himself he made.
43.19:8.w1-w8^when therefore heard - pilate this - word,
43.19:8.w9-w10^[the] more he was afraid.
43.19:9.w1-w6^and he went into the praetorium again,
43.19:9.w7-w10^and he says - to jesus,
43.19:9.w11-w13^from where are you?
43.19:9.w14-w20^- but jesus an answer not did give him.
43.19:9.w14^-
43.2:1.w1-w11^and on the day - third a wedding took place in cana - of galilee,
43.2:1.w12-w18^and was the mother - of jesus there.
43.2:10.w1-w3^and says to him,
43.2:10.w4-w10^every man first the good wine sets out,
43.2:10.w11-w13^and when they might have drunk freely,
43.2:10.w14-w15_2^the inferior;
43.2:10.w16-w22^you have kept the good wine until now.
43.2:11.w1-w11^this did, [the] beginning of the signs, - jesus in cana - of galilee,
43.2:11.w12-w16^and he revealed the glory of him,
43.2:11.w17-w23^and believed in him the disciples of him.
43.2:12.w1-w6^after this he went down to capernaum, he
43.2:12.w7-w18^and the mother of him and the brothers of him and the disciples of him,
43.2:12.w19-w24^and there they stayed not many days.
43.2:13.w1-w7^and near was the passover of the jews,
43.2:13.w8-w13^and went up to jerusalem - jesus.

43.2:15.w23-w26^and the tables he overthrew.
43.2:16.w1-w6^and to those - doves selling he said,
43.2:16.w2-w5^to those - doves selling
43.2:16.w2^to those
43.2:16.w7-w9^take these things from here;
43.2:16.w10-w18^not make the house of the father of me a house of trade.
43.2:17.w1-w4^remembered the disciples of him
43.2:17.w5-w7^that written it is:

43.2:17.w8-w14^the zeal of the house of you will consume me.”
43.2:18.w1-w4^answered therefore the jews
43.2:18.w5-w7^and said to him,
43.2:18.w8-w11^what sign show you to us,
43.2:18.w12-w14^that these things you do?
43.2:19.w1-w2^answered jesus

43.2:20.w13-w19^and you in three days will raise up it?
43.2:21.w1-w9^he however was speaking concerning the temple of the body of him.
43.2:22.w1-w5^when therefore he was raised up out from [the] dead,
43.2:22.w6-w9^remembered the disciples of him
43.2:22.w10-w12^that this he had said,
43.2:22.w13-w23^and they believed the scripture and the word that had spoken - jesus.
43.2:22.w20-w23^that had spoken - jesus.
43.2:23.w1-w12^when then he was in - jerusalem in the passover, in the feast,

43.2:23.w19-w24^beholding of him the signs that he was doing.
43.2:23.w23-w24^that he was doing.
43.2:24.w1-w7^on his part however jesus not did entrust himself to them,
43.2:24.w1^on his part
43.2:24.w8-w12^because of - his knowing all [men],
43.2:24.w8-w9^because of -
43.2:25.w1-w5^and because no need he had
43.2:25.w6-w11^that anyone should testify concerning the man;
43.2:25.w12-w19^he himself for knew what was in the man.
43.2:25.w15-w19^what was in the man.
43.2:3.w1-w3^and having been deficient of wine,

43.2:8.w6-w9^and carry to the master of the feast.
43.2:8.w10-w12^- and they carried [it].

43.20:3.w9-w13^and were coming to the tomb.
43.20:30.w1-w13^many indeed therefore also other signs did - jesus in the presence of the disciples of him,

43.20:9.w8-w11^him out from [the] dead to rise.
43.21:1.w1-w14^after these things, revealed himself again - jesus to the disciples at the sea - of tiberias.
43.21:1.w15-w17^he revealed [himself] now in this way:

43.4:22.w1-w5^you worship what not you know;
43.4:22.w3-w5^what not you know;
43.4:22.w6-w9^we worship what we know,

43.4:22.w10-w16^for - salvation of the jews is.
43.4:23.w1-w3^but is coming an hour
43.4:23.w4-w6^and now is,
43.4:23.w7-w17^when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and truth;

43.4:26.w7-w9^the [one] speaking to you.
43.4:27.w1-w7^and upon this came the disciples of him,
43.4:27.w8-w9^and were amazed
43.4:27.w10-w13^that with a woman he was speaking;
43.4:27.w14-w16^no one however said,
43.4:27.w17-w18^what seek you?
43.4:27.w19-w23^or why speak you with her?
43.4:28.w1-w7^left then the water pot of her the woman,
43.4:28.w8-w12^and went away into the city,
43.4:28.w13-w16^and says to the men,
43.4:29.w1_2^come,

43.4:30.w1-w4^they went forth out of the city
43.4:30.w5-w8^and were coming unto him.
43.4:31.w1-w8^but in the meantime were asking him the disciples, saying,

43.4:32.w8_2^to eat
43.4:32.w9-w12^that you not know.
43.4:33.w1-w6^were saying therefore the disciples to one another,
43.4:33.w7-w11^no one did bring him [anything] to eat?
43.4:33.w11_2^[anything] to eat?
43.4:34.w1-w4^says to them - jesus,

43.4:39.w22-w23^whatever i did.
43.4:4.w1-w7^it was necessary for now him to pass through - samaria.
43.4:4.w3-w7^him to pass through - samaria.
43.4:40.w1-w7^when therefore came to him the samaritans,
43.4:40.w8-w12^they were asking him to abide with them,
43.4:40.w10-w12^to abide with them,
43.4:40.w13-w17^and he stayed there two days.
43.4:41.w1-w8^and many more believed, because of the word of him;
43.4:42.w1-w4^- and to the woman they were saying
43.4:42.w1^-
43.4:42.w5-w11^-, no longer because of - your speech we believe;
43.4:42.w12-w14^we ourselves for have heard,

43.4:42.w17-w24^that this is truly the savior of the world.
43.4:43.w1-w10^after then the two days, he went forth from there into - galilee.
43.4:43.w1^after
43.4:44.w1-w4^himself for jesus testified
43.4:44.w1^himself
43.4:44.w5-w13^that a prophet in the own hometown, honor not has.
43.4:45.w1-w6^when therefore he came into - galilee,
43.4:45.w7-w19^received him the galileans, all things having seen how great he had done in jerusalem during the feast;
43.4:45.w11-w19^all things having seen how great he had done in jerusalem during the feast;

43.4:45.w20-w26^also themselves for they had gone to the feast.
43.4:46.w1-w8^he came therefore again to - cana - of galilee,
43.4:46.w9-w13^where he had made the water wine.
43.4:46.w14-w23^and there was a certain royal official whose - son was sick in capernaum.
43.4:46.w18-w21^whose - son was sick
43.4:47.w1-w14^he, having heard that jesus had come out of - judea into - galilee, went to him
43.4:47.w2_2^having heard
43.4:47.w3-w11^that jesus had come out of - judea into - galilee,
43.4:47.w15-w16^and was asking
43.4:47.w17-w18^that he would come down
43.4:47.w19-w23^and heal his - son;
43.4:47.w24-w26^he was about for to die.
43.4:47.w26_2^to die.
43.4:48.w1-w6^said therefore - jesus to him,
43.4:48.w7-w12^if not signs and wonders you people see,
43.4:48.w13-w15^no not will you believe.
43.4:49.w1-w5^says to him the royal official,

43.4:49.w7_2^come down
43.4:49.w8-w12^before dies the child of me.
43.4:5.w1-w19^he comes therefore to a city - of samaria called sychar, near the plot of ground that had given jacob to joseph, the son of him.
43.4:5.w7-w8^called sychar,
43.4:5.w12-w19^that had given jacob to joseph, the son of him.
43.4:50.w1-w4^says to him - jesus,
43.4:50.w5_2^go,
43.4:50.w6-w9^the son of you lives.
43.4:50.w10-w19^believed the man the word that said to him - jesus,
43.4:50.w15-w19^that said to him - jesus,
43.4:50.w20-w21^and he went on his way.
43.4:51.w1-w4^already then [as] he is going down,
43.4:51.w5-w10^the servants of him met him, saying
43.4:51.w10_2^saying
43.4:51.w11-w15^that the boy of him lives.
43.4:52.w1-w10^he inquired therefore the hour from them in which better he got.
43.4:52.w7-w10^in which better he got.
43.4:52.w11-w13^they said therefore to him
43.4:52.w14-w21^-, yesterday [at the] hour seventh, left him the fever.
43.4:53.w1-w4^knew therefore the father
43.4:53.w5-w19^that [it was] in that the hour at which said to him - jesus, the son of you lives.
43.4:53.w10-w15^at which said to him - jesus,
43.4:53.w16-w19^the son of you lives.
43.4:53.w20-w22^and he believed himself,
43.4:53.w23-w27^and the household of him all.
43.4:54.w1-w15^this [is] now again [the] second sign did - jesus, having come out of - judea into - galilee.
43.4:54.w9-w15^having come out of - judea into - galilee.
43.4:6.w1-w6^was now there [the] well - of jacob.
43.4:6.w7-w18^- therefore jesus, being wearied from the journey, was sitting thus at the well.
43.4:6.w7^-
43.4:6.w10-w13^being wearied from the journey,
43.4:6.w19-w22^[the] hour was about [the] sixth.
43.4:7.w1-w7^comes a woman out of - samaria to draw water.
43.4:7.w6-w7^to draw water.
43.4:7.w8-w11^says to her - jesus,
43.4:7.w12-w14^give me to drink.
43.4:7.w14_2^to drink.
43.4:8.w1-w8^- for the disciples of him had gone away into the city,
43.4:8.w1^-
43.4:8.w9-w11^that food they might buy.
43.4:9.w1-w7^says therefore to him the woman - samaritan,
43.4:9.w8-w18^how you a jew being, from me to drink do ask, a woman samaritan being?
43.4:9.w10-w11^a jew being,
43.4:9.w14_2^to drink
43.4:9.w16-w18^a woman samaritan being?
43.4:9.w19-w23^not for have association jews with samaritans.
43.5:1.w1-w6^after these things there was a feast of the jews,
43.5:1.w7-w11^and went up jesus to jerusalem.
43.5:10.w1-w6^were saying therefore the jews to the [one] having been healed,
43.5:10.w5-w6_2^to the [one] having been healed,
43.5:10.w7-w8^sabbath it is,
43.5:10.w9-w16^and not it is lawful for you to take up the mat of you,
43.5:10.w13-w16^to take up the mat of you,
43.5:11.w1-w4^who however answered them,
43.5:11.w5-w8^the [one] having made me well,
43.5:11.w9-w11^that one to me said,
43.5:11.w12-w15^take up the mat of you
43.5:11.w16-w17^and walk.
43.5:12.w1-w2^they asked him,
43.5:12.w3-w12^who is the man - having said to you, take up and walk?’
43.5:12.w7-w9^- having said to you,
43.5:12.w10_2^take up
43.5:12.w11-w12^and walk?’
43.5:13.w1_2^the [one]
43.5:13.w6-w7^who it is,
43.5:13.w8-w11^- for jesus had moved away,
43.5:13.w8^-
43.5:13.w12-w16^a crowd being in the place.
43.5:14.w1-w9^after these things finds him - jesus in the temple
43.5:14.w10-w12^and said to him,
43.5:14.w13_2^behold,
43.5:14.w14-w15^well you have become;
43.5:14.w16-w17^no more sin,
43.5:14.w18-w23^that not worse to you something happens.
43.5:14.w20^worse
43.5:15.w1-w3^went away the man
43.5:15.w4-w7^and told the jews
43.5:15.w8-w14^that jesus it is the [one] having made him well.
43.5:15.w11-w14^the [one] having made him well.
43.5:16.w1-w8^and because of this, were persecuting the jews - jesus,
43.5:16.w9-w13^because these things he was doing on [the] sabbath.
43.5:17.w1-w5^- but jesus answered them,
43.5:17.w1^-
43.5:17.w6-w11^the father of me until now is working,
43.5:17.w12-w13^and i am working.
43.5:18.w1-w9^because of this therefore, the more were seeking him the jews to kill,
43.5:18.w6_2^him
43.5:18.w10-w15^because not only was he breaking the sabbath,
43.5:18.w16-w27^but also father his own he was calling - god, equal himself making to god.
43.5:18.w23-w27^equal himself making to god.
43.5:18.w23^equal
43.5:19.w1-w4^answered therefore - jesus
43.5:19.w5-w7^and was saying to them,
43.5:19.w8-w11^truly, truly, i say to you,
43.5:19.w12-w19^not is able the son to do of himself nothing,
43.5:19.w16-w19^to do of himself nothing,
43.5:19.w20-w26^if not anything he might see the father doing;
43.5:19.w22_2^anything
43.5:19.w22_3^anything
43.5:19.w26_2^doing;
43.5:19.w27-w31^whatever for - he does,
43.5:19.w32-w37^these things also the son likewise does.
43.5:2.w1-w16^there is now in - jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool, - called in hebrew bethesda, five porches having.
43.5:2.w10-w13^- called in hebrew bethesda,
43.5:2.w14-w16^five porches having.
43.5:20.w1-w6^- for the father loves the son,
43.5:20.w1^-
43.5:20.w7-w13^and all things shows to him that he does;
43.5:20.w11-w13^that he does;
43.5:20.w14-w19^and greater than these he will show him works,
43.5:20.w15-w16_2^greater than these
43.5:20.w20-w22^so that you may marvel.
43.5:21.w1-w7^even as for the father raises up the dead
43.5:21.w8-w9^and gives life,
43.5:21.w10-w16^thus also the son to whom he will, gives life.
43.5:21.w14-w15^to whom he will,
43.5:22.w1-w6^not even for the father judges no one,
43.5:22.w7-w13^but - judgment all has given to the son,
43.5:23.w1-w5^so that all may honor the son,
43.5:23.w6-w9^even as they honor the father.
43.5:23.w10-w14^he who not is honoring the son,
43.5:23.w10^he who
43.5:23.w19-w21^the [one] having sent him.
43.5:24.w1-w4^truly, truly i say to you
43.5:24.w5-w18^that the [one] the word of me hearing, and believing the [one] having sent me, he has life eternal
43.5:24.w6-w10^the [one] the word of me hearing,

43.5:25.w1-w4^truly, truly, i say to you
43.5:25.w5-w7^that is coming an hour,
43.5:25.w8-w10^and now is,
43.5:25.w11-w20^when the dead will hear the voice of the son - of god,
43.5:25.w21-w24^and those having heard will live.
43.5:25.w22-w23_2^those having heard
43.5:26.w1-w8^as for the father has life in himself,

43.5:26.w14-w17^life, to have in himself.
43.5:27.w1-w6^and authority he gave him judgment to execute,
43.5:27.w5-w6^judgment to execute,
43.5:27.w7-w10^because son of man he is.
43.5:28.w1-w3^not marvel at this,
43.5:28.w4-w17^for is coming an hour in which all those in the tombs will hear the voice of him,
43.5:28.w7-w17^in which all those in the tombs will hear the voice of him,
43.5:29.w1-w9^and will come forth — those - good having done, to [the] resurrection of life;
43.5:29.w3-w6^those - good having done,
43.5:29.w3^those
43.5:29.w10_2^-
43.5:3.w1-w9^in these were lying a multitude of those ailing, blind, lame, paralyzed.
43.5:3.w5-w6_2^of those ailing,
43.5:30.w1-w7^not am able i to do of myself nothing;
43.5:30.w4-w7^to do of myself nothing;
43.5:30.w8-w9^as i hear,
43.5:30.w10_2^i judge;
43.5:30.w11-w17^and the judgment - of me just is,
43.5:30.w18-w24^because not i seek the will - of me,
43.5:30.w25-w30^but the will of the [one] having sent me.
43.5:30.w28-w30^of the [one] having sent me.
43.5:31.w1-w5^if i bear witness concerning myself,
43.5:31.w6-w11^the testimony of me not is true.
43.5:32.w1-w6^another it is - bearing witness concerning me,
43.5:32.w3-w6^- bearing witness concerning me,
43.5:32.w7-w8^and i know
43.5:32.w9-w17^that true is the testimony which he bears witness concerning me.
43.5:32.w14-w17^which he bears witness concerning me.
43.5:33.w1-w4^you have sent unto john
43.5:33.w5-w8^and he has borne witness to the truth.
43.5:34.w1-w8^i now not from man the testimony receive,
43.5:34.w9-w11^but these things i say
43.5:34.w12-w14^that you may be saved.

43.5:35.w12-w18^to rejoice for a season in the light of him.
43.5:36.w1-w8^i however have the testimony greater than that of john.
43.5:36.w9-w19^- for the works that has given me the father that i should complete them,
43.5:36.w9^-
43.5:36.w12-w16^that has given me the father

43.6:64.w6-w8^who not believe.
43.6:64.w9-w25^knew for from [the] beginning - jesus who are those not believing and who it is who will betray him.
43.6:64.w15-w19^who are those not believing
43.6:64.w17-w19^those not believing
43.6:64.w17^those
43.6:64.w20-w25^and who it is who will betray him.
43.6:64.w23-w25^who will betray him.
43.6:65.w1-w2^and he was saying,
43.6:65.w3-w6^because of this have i said to you
43.6:65.w7-w12^that no one is able to come to me,
43.6:65.w10-w12^to come to me,
43.6:65.w13-w20^if not it shall have been granted to him from the father.
43.6:65.w16-w20^have been granted to him from the father.
43.6:66.w1-w11^from that [time], many out of the disciples of him departed to the back
43.6:66.w12-w16^and no longer with him walked.
43.6:67.w1-w6^said therefore - jesus to the twelve,
43.6:67.w7-w11^not also you are wishing to go away?
43.6:67.w11_2^to go away?
43.6:68.w1-w4^answered him simon peter,
43.6:68.w5-w8^lord, to whom will we go?
43.6:68.w9-w12^[the] words of life eternal you have;
43.6:69.w1-w3^and we have believed
43.6:69.w4-w5^and have known
43.6:69.w6-w12^that you are the holy one - of god.
43.6:7.w1-w4^answered him - philip,
43.6:7.w5-w10^two hundred denarii worth of loaves not are sufficient for them
43.6:7.w11-w15^that each little [piece] one might receive.
43.6:70.w1-w4^answered them - jesus,
43.6:70.w5-w10^not i you the twelve did choose,
43.6:70.w11-w16^and of you one a devil is?
43.6:71.w1-w6^he was speaking now - of judas [son] of simon iscariot;
43.6:71.w7-w15^he for was about to betray him, one of the twelve.
43.6:71.w10-w11^to betray him,
43.6:71.w7^he
43.6:8.w1-w12^says to him one of the disciples of him, andrew, the brother of simon peter,
43.6:9.w1-w11^is a little boy here, who has five loaves barley and two small fish;
43.6:9.w4-w11^who has five loaves barley and two small fish;
43.6:9.w12-w17^but these what are for so many?
43.7:1.w1-w9^and after these things, was walking - jesus in - galilee;
43.7:1.w10-w16^not for he did desire in - judea to walk,
43.7:1.w13-w16^in - judea to walk,
43.7:1.w17-w22^because were seeking him the jews to kill.
43.7:1.w19_2^him
43.7:10.w1-w9^when however had gone up the brothers of him to the feast,
43.7:10.w10-w13^then also he went up,
43.7:10.w14-w15^not openly,
43.7:10.w16-w19^but as in secret.
43.7:11.w1-w8^the therefore jews were seeking him at the feast
43.7:11.w1^the
43.7:11.w9-w10^and were saying,
43.7:11.w11-w13^where is he?
43.7:12.w1-w9^and murmuring about him there was much among the crowds.
43.7:12.w10-w12^some indeed were saying
43.7:12.w13-w15^-, good he is.
43.7:12.w16-w18^others however were saying,
43.7:12.w19_2^no,
43.7:12.w20-w23^but he deceives the people.
43.7:13.w1-w11^no one however publicly was speaking about him, because of the fear of the jews.
43.7:14.w1-w5^now also of the feast being in the middle,
43.7:14.w6-w10^went up jesus into the temple
43.7:14.w11-w12^and was teaching.
43.7:15.w1-w5^were marveling then the jews, saying,
43.7:15.w5_2^saying,
43.7:15.w6-w11^how this one writings knows, not having studied?
43.7:15.w10-w11^not having studied?
43.7:16.w1-w5^answered therefore them - jesus
43.7:16.w6-w7^and said
43.7:16.w8-w13^-, my teaching not is of myself,
43.7:16.w14-w17^but of the [one] having sent me.
43.7:16.w15-w17^of the [one] having sent me.
43.7:17.w1-w7^if anyone desires the will of him to do,
43.7:17.w4-w7^the will of him to do,
43.7:17.w8-w11^he will know concerning the teaching,
43.7:17.w12-w16^whether from - god it is,
43.7:17.w17-w21^or i from myself speak.
43.7:18.w1-w4^the [one] from himself speaking,
43.7:18.w1^the [one]
43.7:18.w10_2^the [one]
43.7:18.w15-w17^of the [one] having sent him,
43.7:18.w18-w20^he true is,
43.7:18.w21-w26^and unrighteousness in him not is.
43.7:19.w1-w6^not moses has given to you the law,
43.7:19.w7-w13^and no one of you keeps the law?
43.7:19.w14-w17^why me do you seek to kill?
43.7:19.w15_2^me
43.7:2.w1-w9^was now near the feast of the jews, of booths.
43.7:20.w1-w3^answered the crowd,
43.7:20.w4-w5^a demon you have;
43.7:20.w6-w9^who you seeks to kill?
43.7:20.w7_2^you
43.7:21.w1-w2^answered jesus
43.7:21.w3-w5^and said to them,
43.7:21.w6-w8^one work i did,
43.7:21.w9-w11^and all you marvel.
43.7:22.w1-w7^because of the fact that moses has given you - circumcision —
43.7:22.w8-w13^not that of - moses it is,
43.7:22.w14-w17^but of the fathers —
43.7:22.w18-w22^also on sabbath you circumcise a man.
43.7:23.w1-w6^if circumcision receives a man on sabbath
43.7:23.w7-w12^so that not might be broken the law of moses,
43.7:23.w13-w14^with me are you angry
43.7:23.w15-w21^because entirely a man sound i made on the sabbath?
43.7:24.w1-w4^not judge according to appearance,
43.7:24.w5-w9^but the righteous judgment judge.
43.7:25.w1-w6^were saying therefore some of those of jerusalem,
43.7:25.w7-w12^not this is he whom they seek to kill?
43.7:25.w10_2^whom
43.7:26.w1-w2^and behold,
43.7:26.w3-w4^publicly he speaks,
43.7:26.w5-w8^and nothing to him they say
43.7:26.w9-w13^not ever. truly have recognized the rulers
43.7:26.w14-w18^that this is the christ?
43.7:27.w1-w3^but this [man], we know
43.7:27.w4-w5^from where he is.
43.7:27.w6-w8^the however christ,
43.7:27.w6^the
43.7:27.w9-w10^whenever he may come,
43.7:27.w11-w14^no one knows from where he is.
43.7:27.w13-w14^from where he is.
43.7:28.w1-w10^cried out therefore in the temple teaching - jesus, and saying,
43.7:28.w6_2^teaching
43.7:28.w9-w10^and saying,
43.7:28.w11-w12^me you know,
43.7:28.w13-w16^and you know from where i am;
43.7:28.w15-w16^from where i am;
43.7:28.w17-w21^and of myself not i have come,
43.7:28.w22-w27^but is true the [one] having sent me,
43.7:28.w25-w27^the [one] having sent me,
43.7:28.w28-w31^whom you not know.
43.7:29.w1-w3^but i know him,
43.7:29.w4-w7^because from him i am,
43.7:29.w8-w10^and he me sent.
43.7:3.w1-w7^said therefore to him the brothers of him,
43.7:3.w8-w9^depart from here
43.7:3.w10-w14^and go into - judea,
43.7:3.w15-w25^so that also the disciples of you will see of you the works that you are doing.
43.7:3.w24-w25^that you are doing.
43.7:30.w1-w4^they were seeking therefore him to take,
43.7:30.w3-w4^him to take,
43.7:30.w5-w11^but no one laid upon him the hand,
43.7:30.w12-w17^because not yet had come the hour of him.
43.7:31.w1-w8^out of the crowd now many believed in him
43.7:31.w1-w3_2^out of the crowd
43.7:31.w9-w10^and were saying,
43.7:31.w11-w12_2^the christ,
43.7:31.w13-w14^when he comes,
43.7:31.w15-w21^not more signs will he do than this [man] has done?
43.7:31.w19-w21^than this [man] has done?
43.7:32.w1-w9^heard the pharisees the crowd murmuring about him these things,
43.7:32.w6-w9^murmuring about him these things,
43.7:32.w10-w17^and sent the chief priests and the pharisees officers,
43.7:32.w18-w20^that they might seize him.
43.7:33.w1-w4^said therefore - jesus,
43.7:33.w5-w10^yet time a little with you i am,
43.7:33.w11-w16^and i go to the [one] having sent me.
43.7:33.w13-w16^to the [one] having sent me.
43.7:34.w1-w2^you will seek me
43.7:34.w3-w6^and not will find me;
43.7:34.w7-w10^and where am i,
43.7:34.w11-w14^you not are able to come.
43.7:34.w14_2^to come.
43.7:35.w1-w6^said therefore the jews among themselves,
43.7:35.w7_2^where
43.7:35.w11-w15^that we not will find him?
43.7:35.w16-w27^not to the dispersion among the greeks is he about to go and to teach the greeks?
43.7:35.w17-w21_2^to the dispersion among the greeks
43.7:35.w23_2^to go
43.7:35.w24-w27^and to teach the greeks?
43.7:36.w1-w7^what is the word this that he said,
43.7:36.w6-w7^that he said,
43.7:36.w8-w9^you will seek me,
43.7:36.w10-w13^and not will find me,
43.7:36.w14-w17^and where am i
43.7:36.w18-w21^you not are able to come
43.7:36.w21_2^to come
43.7:37.w1-w12^in now the last day, the great [day] of the feast, stood - jesus
43.7:37.w1^in
43.7:37.w13-w15^and cried out, saying,
43.7:37.w15_2^saying,
43.7:37.w16-w18^if anyone thirsts,
43.7:37.w19-w21^let him come to me
43.7:37.w22-w23^and drink.
43.7:38.w1-w4^the [one] believing in me,
43.7:38.w5-w8^as has said the scripture:
43.7:38.w9-w16^rivers out of the belly of him will flow of water living.
43.7:38.w9^rivers
43.7:38.w16_2^living.
43.7:39.w1-w6^this now he said concerning the spirit,
43.7:39.w7_2^whom
43.7:39.w10-w13^those having believed in him;
43.7:39.w14-w17^not yet [given] for was [the] spirit,
43.7:39.w18-w21^because jesus not yet was glorified.
43.7:4.w1-w6^no one for anything in secret does
43.7:4.w7-w12^and seeks himself in public to be.
43.7:4.w10-w12^in public to be.
43.7:4.w13-w15^if these things you do,
43.7:4.w16-w19^show yourself to the world.
43.7:40.w1-w9^[some] of the crowd therefore, having heard the words these, were saying
43.7:40.w5-w8^having heard the words these,
43.7:40.w10-w14^this is truly the prophet.
43.7:41.w1-w2^others were saying,
43.7:41.w3-w6^this is the christ.
43.7:41.w7-w9^others however were saying,
43.7:41.w10-w17^not indeed out of - galilee the christ comes?
43.7:42.w1-w4^not the scripture has said
43.7:42.w5-w20^that out of the seed of david and from bethlehem, the village where was david, comes the christ?
43.7:42.w15-w17^where was david,
43.7:43.w1-w8^a division therefore occurred in the crowd because of him.
43.7:44.w1-w7^some now desired of them to seize him,
43.7:44.w1^some
43.7:44.w6-w7^to seize him,
43.7:44.w8-w14^but no one laid on him the hands.
43.7:45.w1-w9^came therefore the officers to the chief priests and pharisees,
43.7:45.w10-w13^and said to them that,
43.7:45.w14-w18^because of why not did you bring him?
43.7:46.w1-w3^answered the officers,
43.7:46.w4-w7^never spoke like this. a man
43.7:47.w1-w5^answered therefore them the pharisees,
43.7:47.w6-w9^not also you have been deceived?
43.7:48.w1-w8^not any of the rulers has believed on him,
43.7:48.w9-w12^or of the pharisees?
43.7:49.w1-w11^but the crowd this, - not knowing the law, accursed are.
43.7:49.w5-w9^- not knowing the law,
43.7:49.w5^-
43.7:5.w1-w8^not even for the brothers of him were believing in him.
43.7:50.w1-w14^says nicodemus to them, the [one] having come to him, the former one being of them,
43.7:50.w5-w10^the [one] having come to him, the former
43.7:50.w11-w14^one being of them,
43.7:50.w11^one
43.7:51.w1-w7^not the law of us does judge the man,
43.7:51.w8-w13^if not it has heard first from him
43.7:51.w14-w17^and known what he does?
43.7:51.w16-w17^what he does?
43.7:52.w1_2^they answered
43.7:52.w2-w4^and said to him,
43.7:52.w5-w11^not also you from - galilee are?
43.7:52.w12_2^search
43.7:52.w13-w14^and see
43.7:52.w15-w21^that out of - galilee a prophet not is raised.”
43.7:53.w1-w7^and went each to the home of him.
43.7:6.w1-w5^says therefore to them - jesus,
43.7:6.w6-w11^the time - of me not yet is come,
43.7:6.w12-w19^- but the time - of you always is ready.
43.7:6.w12^-
43.7:7.w1-w6^not is able the world to hate you;
43.7:7.w5-w6^to hate you;
43.7:7.w7-w9^me however it hates,
43.7:7.w10-w14^because i bear witness concerning it
43.7:7.w15-w20^that the works of it evil are.
43.7:8.w1-w5^you go up to the feast.
43.7:8.w6-w12^i not am going up to the feast this,
43.7:8.w13-w18^for - my time not yet has been fulfilled.
43.7:9.w1_2^these things
43.8:1.w1-w8^jesus however went to the mount - of olives.
43.8:10.w1_2^having lifted up
43.8:10.w7-w9^woman, where are they?
43.8:10.w10-w12^no one you has condemned?
43.8:11.w1-w3^- and she said,
43.8:11.w4-w5^no one, sir.
43.8:11.w6-w9^said then - jesus,
43.8:11.w10-w13^neither i you do condemn;
43.8:11.w14_2^go,
43.8:11.w15-w20^and from - now [on] no more sin.
43.8:12.w1-w7^again therefore to them spoke - jesus, saying,
43.8:12.w7_2^saying,
43.8:12.w8-w13^i am the light of the world;
43.8:12.w14-w16^the [one] following me
43.8:12.w23-w28^but will have the light - of life.
43.8:13.w1-w5^said therefore to him the pharisees,
43.8:13.w6-w9^you concerning yourself are bearing witness;
43.8:13.w10-w15^the testimony of you not is true.
43.8:14.w1-w2^answered jesus
43.8:14.w3-w5^and said to them,
43.8:14.w6-w10^even if i am bearing witness concerning myself,
43.8:14.w11-w15^true is the testimony of me,
43.8:14.w16-w22^because i know from where i came and where i am going.
43.8:14.w18-w19^from where i came
43.8:14.w20-w22^and where i am going.
43.8:14.w23-w31^you however not know from where i come or where i am going.
43.8:14.w27-w28^from where i come
43.8:14.w29-w31^or where i am going.
43.8:15.w1-w5^you according to the flesh judge;
43.8:15.w6-w9^i not am judging no one.
43.8:16.w1-w5^and if judge however i,
43.8:16.w6-w11^- judgment - my true is,
43.8:16.w12-w15^because alone not i am,
43.8:16.w16-w22^but i and the having sent me father.
43.8:16.w20-w21^having sent me
43.8:17.w1-w8^and in the law also - of you it has been written
43.8:17.w2-w4^in the law
43.8:17.w9-w15^that of two men the testimony true is.
43.8:18.w1-w6^i am the [one] bearing witness concerning myself,
43.8:18.w3-w6^the [one] bearing witness concerning myself,
43.8:18.w7-w14^and bears witness concerning me the having sent me father.
43.8:18.w12-w13^having sent me
43.8:19.w1-w3^they were saying therefore to him,
43.8:19.w4-w8^where is the father of you?
43.8:19.w9-w10^answered jesus,
43.8:19.w11-w17^neither me you know, nor the father of me.
43.8:19.w12_2^me
43.8:19.w18-w20^if me you had known,
43.8:19.w21-w26^also the father of me - you would have known.
43.8:2.w1-w7^early in the morning then again he came into the temple,
43.8:2.w8-w14^and all the people were coming to him.
43.8:2.w15-w18^and having sat down, he was teaching them.
43.8:2.w16_2^having sat down,
43.8:20.w1-w11^these - words he spoke in the treasury, teaching in the temple;
43.8:20.w8-w11^teaching in the temple;
43.8:20.w12-w15^and no one seized him,
43.8:20.w16-w21^for not yet had come the hour of him.
43.8:21.w1-w4^he said then again to them,
43.8:21.w5-w6^i am going away
43.8:21.w7-w9^and you will seek me,
43.8:21.w10-w15^and in the sin of you, you will die;
43.8:21.w16-w18^where i go,
43.8:21.w19-w22^you not are able to come.
43.8:21.w22_2^to come.

43.8:22.w16_2^to come’?
43.8:23.w1-w3^and he was saying to them,

43.8:28.w6-w11^when you shall have lifted up the son - of man,
43.8:28.w12-w13^then you will know
43.8:28.w14-w16^that i am [he],
43.8:28.w17-w21^and from myself i do nothing,

43.8:37.w1_2^i know
43.8:37.w2-w5^that seed of abraham you are;
43.8:37.w6-w9^but you seek me to kill,
43.8:37.w8-w9^me to kill,
43.8:37.w10-w18^because the word - of me not receives a place in you.
43.8:38.w1-w6^that which i have seen with the father,
43.8:38.w8-w16^also you therefore what you have heard from the father, you do.

43.8:39.w1_2^they answered
43.8:39.w2-w4^and said to him,
43.8:39.w5-w9^the father of us abraham is.

43.8:42.w22-w26^not even for of myself have i come,
43.8:42.w27-w30^but he me sent.
43.8:43.w1-w8^because of why the speech - my not do you understand?

43.8:43.w12-w16^to hear the word - my.
43.8:44.w1-w7^you of the father the devil are,
43.8:44.w8-w15^and the desires of father of you, you desire to do.
43.8:44.w9-w13_2^the desires of father of you,
43.8:44.w16-w20^he a murderer was from [the] beginning,
43.8:44.w21-w26^and in the truth not has stood,

43.8:44.w37-w40^from the own he speaks;
43.8:44.w41-w43^for a liar he is,
43.8:44.w44-w47^and the father of it.

43.8:47.w1-w5^he who is of - god,
43.8:47.w11-w15^because of this you not hear,
43.8:47.w16-w21^because of - god, not you are.
43.8:48.w1-w3^answered the jews
43.8:48.w4-w6^and said to him,
43.8:48.w7-w10^not rightly say we
43.8:48.w11-w14^that a samaritan are you,
43.8:48.w15-w17^and a demon have?
43.8:49.w1-w2^answered jesus,
43.8:49.w3-w6^i a demon not have;
43.8:49.w7-w11^but i honor the father of me,
43.8:49.w12-w15^and you dishonor me.
43.8:5.w1-w10^in now the law, us moses commanded - such to be stoned.
43.8:5.w1^in
43.8:5.w8-w10^- such to be stoned.
43.8:5.w11-w14^you therefore, what say you?
43.8:50.w1-w7^i now not seek the glory of me;
43.8:50.w8-w12^there is one seeking [it] and judging.
43.8:50.w9-w10_2^one seeking [it]
43.8:50.w11-w12^and judging.
43.8:51.w1-w4^truly, truly, i say to you,

43.8:51.w11-w17^death never not shall he see, to the age.
43.8:52.w1-w5^said therefore to him the jews,
43.8:52.w6-w7^now we know
43.8:52.w8-w10^that a demon you have.
43.8:52.w11-w12^abraham died,
43.8:52.w13-w15^and the prophets,
43.8:52.w16-w18^and you say,
43.8:52.w19-w24^if anyone the word of me keeps,
43.8:52.w25-w31^never not shall he taste of death, to the age.
43.8:53.w1-w8^not you greater than are the father of us abraham,
43.8:53.w3^greater than
43.8:53.w9-w10^who died?
43.8:53.w11-w14^and the prophets died!
43.8:53.w15-w17^whom yourself make you?
43.8:54.w1-w2^answered jesus,
43.8:54.w3-w6^if i glorify myself,
43.8:54.w7-w11^the glory of me nothing is;
43.8:54.w12-w18^it is the father of me - glorifying me,
43.8:54.w16-w18^- glorifying me,
43.8:54.w19-w21^[of] whom you say
43.8:54.w22-w25^-, god of us he is.
43.8:55.w1-w4^and not you have known him,
43.8:55.w5-w8^i however know him.
43.8:55.w9-w10^and if i say
43.8:55.w11-w14^that not i know him,
43.8:55.w15-w18^i will be like you, a liar.
43.8:55.w19-w21^but i know him,
43.8:55.w22-w26^and the word of him i keep.
43.8:56.w1-w5^abraham the father of you rejoiced
43.8:56.w6-w11^in that he should see - day - my,
43.8:56.w12-w13^and he saw
43.8:56.w14-w15^and rejoiced.
43.8:57.w1-w6^said therefore the jews to him,
43.8:57.w7-w10^fifty years [old] not yet are you,
43.8:57.w11-w13^and abraham you have seen?
43.8:58.w1-w3^said to them jesus,
43.8:58.w4-w7^truly, truly, i say to you,
43.8:58.w8-w10^before abraham was,
43.8:58.w11-w12^i am.
43.8:59.w1-w3^they took up therefore stones,
43.8:59.w4-w7^that they might cast at him;
43.8:59.w8-w10^jesus however hid himself,
43.8:59.w11-w15^and went forth out of the temple.
43.8:6.w1-w5^this now they were saying, testing him
43.8:6.w4-w5^testing him
43.8:6.w6-w9^so that they might have [grounds] to accuse him.
43.8:6.w8-w9^to accuse him.
43.8:6.w10-w20^- but jesus, down having stooped, with [his] finger began writing on the ground.
43.8:6.w10^-
43.8:6.w13-w14^down having stooped,
43.8:7.w1-w5^as however they continued asking him,
43.8:7.w4-w5^asking him,
43.8:7.w6_2^having lifted himself up
43.8:7.w7-w9^also, he said to them,
43.8:7.w10-w17^the [one] sinless among you, [the] first at her let him cast. stone
43.8:8.w1-w7^and again having stooped down, he continued to write on the ground.
43.8:8.w3_2^having stooped down,
43.8:9.w1_2^-
43.8:9.w8-w11^having begun from the elder ones,
43.8:9.w12-w14^and he was left alone,
43.8:9.w15-w20^and the woman in [the] midst being.
43.8:9.w18-w20^in [the] midst being.
43.9:1.w1-w7^and passing by, he saw a man blind from birth.
43.9:1.w2_2^passing by,
43.9:10.w1-w3^they were saying therefore to him,
43.9:10.w4-w9^how then were opened of you the eyes?
43.9:11.w1_2^answered
43.9:11.w2-w9^he, the man - called jesus clay made,
43.9:11.w5-w7^- called jesus
43.9:11.w10-w14^and anointed of me the eyes,
43.9:11.w15-w17^and he said to me
43.9:11.w18-w22^-, go to - siloam
43.9:11.w23-w24^and wash.
43.9:11.w25_2^having gone
43.9:11.w27-w28^and having washed,
43.9:12.w1-w3^and they said to him,
43.9:12.w4-w6^where is he?
43.9:12.w7_2^he says,
43.9:12.w8-w9^not i know.
43.9:13.w1-w8^they bring him to the pharisees who once [was] blind.
43.9:13.w2_2^him
43.9:14.w1-w3^was now sabbath
43.9:14.w4-w11^in which day the clay had made - jesus
43.9:14.w12-w16^and opened of him the eyes.
43.9:15.w1-w7^again therefore were asking him also the pharisees
43.9:15.w8-w9^how he had received sight.
43.9:15.w10-w13^- and he said to them,
43.9:15.w14-w19^clay he put of me on the eyes,
43.9:15.w20-w21^and i washed,
43.9:15.w22-w23^and i see.
43.9:16.w1-w6^were saying therefore of the pharisees some,
43.9:16.w7-w13^not is this from god the man,
43.9:16.w9^this
43.9:16.w14-w18^for the sabbath not he does keep.
43.9:16.w19-w21^others however were saying,
43.9:16.w22-w28^how is able a man sinful such signs to do?
43.9:16.w26-w28^such signs to do?
43.9:16.w29-w33^and division there was among them.
43.9:17.w1-w5^they say therefore to the blind [man] again,
43.9:17.w6-w10^what you say concerning him,
43.9:17.w11-w15^for he opened of you the eyes?
43.9:17.w16-w18^- and he said
43.9:17.w19-w21^-, a prophet he is.
43.9:18.w1-w7^not did believe then the jews concerning him
43.9:18.w8-w10^that he had been blind
43.9:18.w11-w12^and had received sight,
43.9:18.w13-w20^until when they called the parents of him - having received sight.
43.9:18.w19-w20_2^- having received sight.
43.9:19.w1-w4^and they asked them saying,
43.9:19.w4_2^saying,
43.9:19.w5-w9^this is the son of you,
43.9:19.w10-w12^of whom you say
43.9:19.w13-w15^that blind he was born?
43.9:19.w16-w19^how then does he see presently?
43.9:2.w1-w7^and asked him the disciples of him saying,
43.9:2.w7_2^saying,
43.9:2.w8-w10^rabbi, who sinned,
43.9:2.w11-w15_2^this [man] or the parents of him,
43.9:2.w16-w18^that blind he should be born?
43.9:20.w1-w5^answered therefore the parents of him
43.9:20.w6-w7^and said,
43.9:20.w8_2^we know
43.9:20.w9-w14^that this is the son of us,
43.9:20.w15-w18^and that blind he was born.
43.9:21.w1-w4^how however presently he sees,
43.9:21.w5-w6^not we know,
43.9:21.w7-w12^or who opened of him the eyes,
43.9:21.w13-w15^we not know;
43.9:21.w16-w17^him ask;
43.9:21.w18-w20^age has he.
43.9:21.w21-w23^concerning himself, he will speak.
43.9:22.w1-w5^these things said the parents of him
43.9:22.w6-w9^because they were afraid of the jews;
43.9:22.w10-w14^already for had agreed together the jews
43.9:22.w15-w20^that if anyone him should confess christ,
43.9:22.w21-w22^expelled from the synagogue he would be.
43.9:23.w1-w6^because of this, the parents of him said
43.9:23.w7-w9^-, age he has;
43.9:23.w10-w11^him ask.
43.9:24.w1-w9^they called therefore the man out a second time who had been blind,
43.9:24.w7-w9^who had been blind,
43.9:24.w10-w12^and said to him,
43.9:24.w13-w16^give glory - to god!
43.9:24.w17-w18^we know
43.9:24.w19-w24^that this - man a sinner is.
43.9:25.w1-w3^answered then he,
43.9:25.w4-w6^whether a sinner he is,
43.9:25.w7-w8^not i know.
43.9:25.w9-w10^one [thing] i do know,
43.9:25.w11-w15^that blind being, now i see.
43.9:25.w12-w13^blind being,
43.9:26.w1-w3^they said therefore to him,
43.9:26.w4-w6^what did he to you?
43.9:26.w7-w11^how opened he of you the eyes?
43.9:27.w1-w2^he answered them,
43.9:27.w3-w5^i told you already,
43.9:27.w6-w8^and not you did listen.
43.9:27.w9-w12^why again do you wish to hear?
43.9:27.w10_2^again
43.9:27.w13-w19^not also you do wish his disciples to become?
43.9:27.w17-w19^his disciples to become?
43.9:28.w1-w3^and they railed at him
43.9:28.w4-w5^and said,
43.9:28.w6-w9^you a disciple are of that one;
43.9:28.w7^a disciple

43.9:29.w1-w2^we know
43.9:29.w3-w7^that to moses has spoken - god;
43.9:29.w8-w11^this [man] however not we know
43.9:29.w12-w13^from where is.
43.9:3.w1-w2^answered jesus,
43.9:3.w3-w5^neither this [man] sinned,
43.9:3.w6-w9^nor the parents of him;
43.9:3.w10-w18^but [it was] that should be displayed the works - of god in him.
43.9:30.w1-w3^answered the man
43.9:30.w4-w6^and said to them,
43.9:30.w7-w12^in this for - an amazing thing is,
43.9:30.w13-w16^that you not know
43.9:30.w17-w18^from where he is,
43.9:30.w19-w23^and yet he opened my - eyes.
43.9:31.w1_2^we know
43.9:31.w2-w7^that sinners - god not does hear;
43.9:31.w8-w12^but if anyone god-fearing is,
43.9:31.w13-w17^and the will of him does,
43.9:31.w18-w19^him he hears.
43.9:32.w1-w5^out of the age never it has been heard,
43.9:32.w6-w11^that opened anyone [the] eyes of [one] blind having been born.
43.9:32.w11_2^having been born.
43.9:33.w1-w6^if not were this [man] from god,
43.9:33.w7-w10^not he could do nothing.
43.9:33.w9-w10^do nothing.
43.9:34.w1_2^they answered

44.14:27.w14-w20^and that he had opened to the gentiles a door of faith.
44.14:28.w1-w8^they remained then time no little with the disciples.
44.14:3.w1-w26^a long indeed therefore time they stayed, speaking boldly for the lord, the [one] bearing witness to the word of the grace of him, granting signs and wonders to be done through the hands of them.

44.14:3.w19-w26^signs and wonders to be done through the hands of them.
44.14:4.w1-w6^was divided now the multitude of the city,
44.14:4.w7-w13^and some indeed were with the jews;
44.14:4.w14-w18^some however with the apostles.
44.14:5.w1-w17^when then there was a rush of the gentiles both and jews, with the rulers of them, to mistreat and to stone them,
44.14:5.w14_2^to mistreat
44.14:5.w15-w17^and to stone them,
44.14:6.w1_2^having become aware,
44.14:7.w1-w3^and there preaching the gospel they continued.
44.14:7.w2_2^preaching the gospel
44.14:8.w1-w14^and a certain man crippled, in lystra, in the feet, was sitting, lame from [the] womb of [the] mother of him,

44.14:8.w7-w8_3^in the feet,
44.14:8.w15-w17^who never had walked.
44.14:9.w1-w5^this [man] heard - paul speaking,
44.14:9.w5_2^speaking,
44.14:9.w6-10.w3^who, having looked intently at him and having seen that he has faith - to be healed, said in a loud voice,
44.14:9.w7-w8^having looked intently at him
44.14:9.w9-w10^and having seen
44.14:9.w11-w15^that he has faith - to be healed,
44.15:1.w1-w9^and certain ones having come down from - judea were teaching the brothers
44.15:1.w3-w6^having come down from - judea
44.15:1.w10-w17^-, if not you are circumcised according to the custom - of moses,
44.15:1.w18-w20^not you are able to be saved.
44.15:1.w20_2^to be saved.
44.15:10.w1-w13^now therefore, why are you testing - god, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples
44.15:10.w7-w13^to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples
44.15:10.w14-w22^that neither the fathers of us, nor we, have been able to bear?
44.15:10.w22_2^to bear?
44.15:11.w1-w9^but by the grace of [the] lord jesus, we believe to be saved,
44.15:11.w9_2^to be saved,
44.15:11.w10-w13^in [the] same manner [as] they also.
44.15:12.w1-w5^kept silent now all the multitude,
44.15:12.w6-w23^and were listening to barnabas and paul relating what had done - god, signs and wonders, among the gentiles by them.
44.15:12.w11-w23^relating what had done - god, signs and wonders, among the gentiles by them.
44.15:12.w12-w23^what had done - god, signs and wonders, among the gentiles by them.
44.15:12.w12^what
44.15:13.w1_2^after
44.15:13.w8_2^saying,
44.15:13.w9-w12^men, brothers, hear me.
44.15:14.w1-w2^simeon has related
44.15:14.w3-w14^how first - god visited, to take out of [the] gentiles a people for the name of him.
44.15:14.w8-w14^to take out of [the] gentiles a people for the name of him.
44.15:15.w1-w7^and with this agree the words of the prophets,
44.15:15.w8-w9^as it is written:
44.15:16.w1-w3^after these things i will return
44.15:16.w4-w10^and will rebuild the tabernacle of david which has fallen,
44.15:16.w9-w10_2^which has fallen,
44.15:16.w11-w15^and the ruins of it i will rebuild,
44.15:16.w12-w14_2^the ruins of it
44.15:16.w16-w18^and i will set upright it,
44.15:17.w1-w9^so that - may seek out the remnant - of men the lord,
44.15:17.w10-w21^and all the gentiles, upon whom has been called the name of me upon them,
44.15:17.w14-w21^upon whom has been called the name of me upon them,
44.15:17.w22-18.w3^says [the] lord, doing these things, known from eternity.’
44.15:17.w24-18.w3^doing these things, known from eternity.’
44.15:19.w1-20.w18^therefore i judge not to trouble those who, from the gentiles, are turning to - god, but to write to them - to abstain from the pollutions of the idols, and - sexual immorality, and that which is strangled, and from blood.
44.15:19.w4-w13^not to trouble those who, from the gentiles, are turning to - god,
44.15:19.w6-w13^those who, from the gentiles, are turning to - god,
44.15:19.w6^those who,
44.15:2.w1-w14^having been brought about then commotion and discussion no small - by paul and - barnabas with them,
44.15:2.w15-w35^they appointed to go up paul and barnabas and certain others out from them, to the apostles and elders, to jerusalem, about the question this.
44.15:2.w16-w35^to go up paul and barnabas and certain others out from them, to the apostles and elders, to jerusalem, about the question this.
44.15:20.w1-w18^but to write to them - to abstain from the pollutions of the idols, and - sexual immorality, and that which is strangled, and from blood.
44.15:20.w4-w18^- to abstain from the pollutions of the idols, and - sexual immorality, and that which is strangled, and from blood.

44.15:21.w12-w18^in the synagogues on every sabbath being read.
44.15:22.w1-23.w4^then it seemed good to the apostles and to the elders, with all the church, having chosen men out from them, to send to antioch with - paul and barnabas: judas - called barsabbas, and silas, men leading among the brothers, having written by [the] hand of them:
44.15:22.w12_2^having chosen

44.15:24.w15-w17^to whom not we had given instructions,
44.15:25.w1-26.w13^it seemed good to us having come with one accord, having chosen men, to send to you, with the beloved of us, barnabas and paul, men having handed over the lives of them for the name of the lord of us, jesus christ.
44.15:25.w3-w4^having come with one accord,

44.15:26.w2-w13^having handed over the lives of them for the name of the lord of us, jesus christ.
44.15:27.w1-w5^we have sent therefore judas and silas,
44.15:27.w6-w12^and they by word [of mouth] are telling [you] the same things.
44.15:27.w8-w12^by word [of mouth] are telling [you] the same things.
44.15:28.w1-29.w8^it seemed good for to the spirit - holy and to us, no further to lay upon you burden, except these - necessary things: to abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from sexual immorality.

44.15:29.w9-w12^from these keeping yourselves,
44.15:29.w15_2^farewell.
44.15:3.w1-w18^they indeed therefore having been sent forward by the church were passing through - both phoenicia and samaria, relating in detail the conversion of the gentiles,

44.15:3.w14-w18^relating in detail the conversion of the gentiles,
44.15:3.w19-w25^and they were bringing joy great to all the brothers.
44.15:30.w1-w7^they indeed therefore, having been sent off, went to antioch,
44.15:30.w4_2^having been sent off,
44.15:30.w8-w14^and having gathered the multitude, they delivered the letter.

44.24:8.w5_2^having examined [him]
44.24:8.w10-w13^of which we accuse him.
44.24:9.w1-w9^agreed then also the jews, declaring these things so to be.

44.24:9.w7-w9^these things so to be.
44.25:1.w1-w13^festus therefore having arrived in the province, after three days he went up to jerusalem from caesarea.
44.25:1.w3-w5^having arrived in the province,
44.25:10.w1-w4^said then - paul,

44.25:11.w5-w9^and worthy of death have done anything,
44.25:11.w6-w7_2^worthy of death

44.25:11.w23_2^me
44.25:11.w27-w28^to caesar i appeal!
44.25:12.w1-w8^then - festus, having conferred with the council, answered,

44.25:12.w9-w10^to caesar you have appealed;
44.25:12.w11-w13^to caesar you will go!

44.25:13.w1^days
44.25:13.w5-w15^agrippa the king and bernice came down to caesarea, greeting - festus.

44.25:15.w15-w18^asking against him judgment,
44.25:16.w1-w3^to whom i answered
44.25:16.w4-w27^that not it is [the] custom with romans to give up any man before that the [one] being accused to face may have [it] the accusers [the] opportunity, and of defense he may have concerning the accusation.

44.25:18.w3_2^having stood up,
44.25:18.w9-w11^of which i was expecting
44.25:19.w1-w15^questions however certain concerning the own religion they had against him, and concerning a certain jesus having been dead,
44.25:19.w1^questions
44.25:19.w3-w7^certain concerning the own religion
44.25:19.w15_2^having been dead,

44.25:2.w14-3.w4^and they were begging him, asking a favor against him,
44.25:20.w1_2^being perplexed
44.25:20.w9-w17^if he was willing to go to jerusalem and there to be judged concerning these things.
44.25:20.w11-w13^to go to jerusalem
44.25:20.w14-w17^and there to be judged concerning these things.
44.25:21.w1-w11^- but of paul having appealed for to be kept himself for the - emperor's decision,
44.25:21.w1^-
44.25:21.w5-w11^to be kept himself for the - emperor's decision,
44.25:21.w12-w20^i commanded to be kept him until that i might send him to caesar.

44.25:21.w15-w20^until that i might send him to caesar.
44.25:22.w1-w5^agrippa then [said] to - festus,
44.25:22.w6-w11^i have been wanting also myself the man to hear.
44.25:22.w9-w11^the man to hear.
44.25:22.w12-w15^tomorrow, he says, you will hear him.
44.25:22.w13_2^he says,

44.25:23.w1^on the
44.25:23.w13-w27^and having entered into the audience hall, with both [the] commanders and men - in prominence in the city,
44.25:23.w28-w31^and having commanded - festus,
44.25:23.w32-w34^was brought in - paul.
44.25:24.w1-w4^and says - festus,
44.25:24.w5-w14^agrippa king, and all the being present with us men, you see this one,
44.25:24.w10-w11^being present with us
44.25:24.w15-w34^concerning whom all the multitude of the jews pleaded with me, in both jerusalem and here, crying out [that] not he ought of him to live no longer.
44.25:24.w29-w34^crying out [that] not he ought of him to live no longer.
44.25:24.w30-w34^not he ought of him to live no longer.
44.25:24.w32-w34^of him to live no longer.
44.25:25.w1-w8^i however, having understood nothing worthy him of death to have done,
44.25:25.w4-w8^nothing worthy him of death to have done,
44.25:25.w4-w5^nothing worthy
44.25:25.w9-w14^himself and of this one having appealed to the emperor,
44.25:25.w9^himself
44.25:25.w15-w16^i determined to send [him],

44.25:26.w1-w7^concerning whom, definite anything to write to [my] lord,
44.25:26.w10-w20^therefore i have brought him before you all, and especially before you, king agrippa,
44.25:26.w21-w24^so that the examination having taken place,
44.25:26.w25-w27^i might have something to write.
44.25:26.w26-w27^something to write.
44.25:27.w1-w13^absurd for to me it seems [in] sending a prisoner, not also the against him charges to specify.

44.25:4.w1-w16^- indeed therefore festus answered that is to be kept - paul in caesarea; he himself now is about in quickness to set out.

44.25:5.w9^anything
44.25:5.w15-w16^let them accuse him.
44.25:6.w1_2^having spent
44.25:6.w6^not
44.25:6.w11-w13^having gone down to caesarea,
44.25:6.w14-w19^on the next day having sat on the judgment seat,
44.25:6.w21-w23^- paul to be brought.
44.25:7.w1-w3^having arrived then he,
44.25:7.w4-w15^stood around him the from jerusalem having come down jews, many and weighty charges bringing,
44.25:7.w7-w9^from jerusalem having come down
44.25:7.w11-w15^many and weighty charges bringing,
44.25:7.w16_2^which
44.25:8.w1-w3^- paul made his defense
44.25:8.w4-w19^-: neither against the law of the jews, nor against the temple, nor against caesar, [in] anything have i sinned.
44.25:9.w1-w12^- festus however, wishing on the jews a favor to lay, answering - paul, said,
44.25:9.w4-w8^wishing on the jews a favor to lay,
44.25:9.w5-w8^on the jews a favor to lay,
44.25:9.w9-w11^answering - paul,
44.25:9.w13-w22^are you willing to jerusalem having gone up, there concerning these things to be judged before me?
44.25:9.w14-w16^to jerusalem having gone up,
44.26:1.w1-w6^agrippa then to - paul was saying,
44.26:1.w7-w11^it is permitted you for yourself to speak.
44.26:1.w9-w11^for yourself to speak.
44.26:1.w12-w18^then - paul, having stretched out the hand, began his defense:
44.26:1.w15-w17^having stretched out the hand,
44.26:10.w1-w5^which also i did in jerusalem;
44.26:10.w6-w20^and many also of the saints i in prisons locked up, the from the chief priests authority having received;
44.26:10.w15-w20^the from the chief priests authority having received;
44.26:10.w21-w23^being put to death then they,
44.26:10.w24-w25^i cast against [them] a vote.
44.26:11.w1-w10^and in all the synagogues, often punishing them, i was compelling [them] to blaspheme.
44.26:11.w2-w8^in all the synagogues, often punishing them,
44.26:11.w10_2^to blaspheme.
44.26:11.w11_2^exceedingly

44.26:12.w1-w13^during which, journeying to - damascus with [the] authority and commission of the chief priests,

44.26:13.w17-w21^and those with me journeying.
44.26:13.w17-w18^and those
44.26:14.w1-w7^all and having fallen down of us to the ground,
44.26:14.w1^all
44.26:14.w8-w15^i heard a voice saying to me in the hebrew language,
44.26:14.w10-w15^saying to me in the hebrew language,
44.26:14.w16-w20^saul, saul, why me persecute you?
44.26:14.w21-w25^[it is] hard for you against [the] goads to kick.
44.26:14.w23-w25^against [the] goads to kick.
44.26:15.w1-w3^i then said,
44.26:15.w4-w6^who are you, lord?
44.26:15.w7-w10^- and the lord said,
44.26:15.w7^-
44.26:15.w11-w13^i am jesus,
44.26:15.w14-w16^whom you are persecuting.
44.26:16.w1-w2^but rise up
44.26:16.w3-w8^and stand on the feet of you;
44.26:16.w9-w13^for this purpose for i have appeared to you,
44.26:16.w14-18.w31^to appoint you a servant and a witness of that which both you have seen of me, of the things in which then i will appear to you, delivering you out from the people and from the gentiles, to whom i am sending you, to open eyes of them, that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power - of satan to - god, [that] may receive they forgiveness of sins and [an] inheritance among those having been sanctified by faith that [is] in me.
44.26:16.w19-w22^of that which both you have seen of me,
44.26:16.w23-w26^of the things in which then i will appear to you,
44.26:17.w1-18.w31^delivering you out from the people and from the gentiles, to whom i am sending you, to open eyes of them, that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power - of satan to - god, [that] may receive they forgiveness of sins and [an] inheritance among those having been sanctified by faith that [is] in me.

44.26:18.w25-w31^among those having been sanctified by faith that [is] in me.
44.26:19.w1-w9^so then, o king agrippa, not i was disobedient to the heavenly vision,
44.26:2.w1-w16^concerning all of which i am accused by [the] jews, king agrippa, i esteem myself fortunate before you, being about today to defend myself.
44.26:2.w3-w6^of which i am accused by [the] jews,
44.26:2.w12-w13_2^before you,
44.26:20.w1-w29^but to those in damascus first, both and jerusalem all, and the region - of judea, and to the gentiles, i kept declaring to repent and to turn to - god, worthy - of repentance works doing.
44.26:20.w19_2^to repent
44.26:20.w20-w29^and to turn to - god, worthy - of repentance works doing.

44.26:24.w1-w4^these things now of him saying in his defense,
44.26:24.w5-w10^- festus in a loud - voice said,
44.26:24.w11-w12^you are insane, paul!
44.26:24.w13-w19^the great of you learning, to insanity turns [you]!
44.26:24.w13-w14^the great
44.26:25.w1-w6^- but paul, not i am insane, says,

44.26:25.w4-w5^not i am insane,
44.26:25.w7-w14^most excellent festus, but of truth and sobriety words i utter.
44.26:26.w1-w6^understands for concerning these things the king,
44.26:26.w7-w11^to whom also using boldness i speak.
44.26:26.w10_2^using boldness
44.26:26.w12_2^are hidden from
44.26:26.w14-w16^him any of these things
44.26:26.w20-w26^not for is in a corner done, of these things.
44.26:26.w23-w25^in a corner done,
44.26:27.w1-w5^believe you, king agrippa, the prophets?
44.26:27.w6_2^i know
44.26:27.w7-w8^that you believe.
44.26:28.w1-w6^- then agrippa [said] to - paul,
44.26:28.w1^-
44.26:28.w7-w12^within so little me do you persuade a christian to become?
44.26:28.w11-w12^a christian to become?
44.26:29.w1-w3^- and paul [said],
44.26:29.w1^-
44.26:29.w4-w33^i would wish - - to god, both in a little and in much, not only you but also all those hearing me this day, to become such as also i am, except the chains these.
44.26:29.w8-w33^both in a little and in much, not only you but also all those hearing me this day, to become such as also i am, except the chains these.
44.26:29.w17-w23^but also all those hearing me this day,

44.26:3.w1-w12^especially acquainted being you with all the of [the] jews customs, and also controversies;
44.26:3.w2^acquainted
44.26:3.w13-w17^therefore i implore [you] patiently to hear me.
44.26:3.w15-w17^patiently to hear me.
44.26:30.w1-w14^rose up then the king and the governor - and bernice and those sitting with them,
44.26:30.w11-w14^and those sitting with them,
44.26:31.w1-w6^and having withdrawn, they began speaking to one another saying
44.26:31.w2_2^having withdrawn,
44.26:31.w6_2^saying
44.26:31.w7-w17^-, nothing of death or of chains worthy any is doing the man this.

44.26:5.w7-w16^that according to the strictest sect - of our religion i lived [as] a pharisee.
44.26:6.w1-w16^and now for [the] hope of the to the fathers of us promise having been made by - god, i stand being judged,
44.26:6.w16_2^being judged,
44.26:7.w1-w13^to which the twelve tribes of us in earnestness, night and day, serving, hope to attain;

44.26:8.w6-w10^if - god [the] dead raises?
44.26:9.w1-w15^i indeed therefore thought in myself to the name of jesus - of nazareth, i ought many things contrary to do,

45.10:15.w1-w3^how now shall they preach
45.10:15.w4-w6^if not they are sent?
45.10:15.w7-w8^as it has been written:
45.10:15.w9-w16^how beautiful the feet of those proclaiming good news of good things!”
45.10:15.w13-w16^of those proclaiming good news of good things!”
45.10:16.w1-w6^but not all heeded the good news.
45.10:16.w7-w9^isaiah for says,
45.10:16.w10-w15^lord, who has believed the report of us?”
45.10:17.w1-w5^so - faith [is] from hearing,
45.10:17.w6-w11^- and hearing through [the] word of christ.
45.10:17.w6^-
45.10:18.w1-w2^but i ask,
45.10:18.w3-w5^no not did they hear?
45.10:18.w6-w14^indeed: into all the earth has gone out the voice of them;
45.10:18.w15-w23^and to the ends of the world, the words of them.”
45.10:19.w1-w2^but i ask,
45.10:19.w3-w6^not israel not did know?
45.10:19.w7-w9^first, moses says:
45.10:19.w10-w15^i will provoke to jealousy you by [those] not a nation;
45.10:19.w16-w20^by a nation without understanding, i will anger you.”
45.10:2.w1-w3^i bear witness for about them,
45.10:2.w4-w7^that zeal for god they have,
45.10:2.w8-w11^but not according to knowledge.
45.10:20.w1-w3^isaiah then is very bold
45.10:20.w4-w5^and says:
45.10:20.w6-w11^i was found by those me not seeking;
45.10:20.w7-w11^by those me not seeking;
45.10:20.w7-w8^by those
45.10:20.w12-w17^manifest i became to those me not inquiring after.”
45.10:20.w14-w17^to those me not inquiring after.”
45.10:20.w14^to those
45.10:21.w1-w5^as for however, - israel, he says:
45.10:21.w1^as for
45.10:21.w6-w17^all the day, i have stretched out the hands of me, to a people disobeying and contradicting.”
45.10:21.w15_2^disobeying
45.10:21.w16-w17^and contradicting.”
45.10:3.w1-w6^being ignorant of for the - of god righteousness,
45.10:3.w7-w12^and the own righteousness seeking to establish,
45.10:3.w8-w10_2^the own righteousness
45.10:4.w1-w9^[the] end for of law [is] christ, unto righteousness to everyone - believing.
45.10:4.w1^[the] end
45.10:4.w7-w9_2^to everyone - believing.
45.10:5.w1-w9^moses for writes [of] the righteousness that [is] of the law,
45.10:5.w10-w17^that the having done these things man, will live by them.”
45.10:5.w12-w13^having done these things
45.10:6.w1-w7^the however of faith righteousness, thus speaks:
45.10:6.w1^the
45.10:6.w8-w13^not you should say in the heart of you,
45.10:6.w14-w18^who will ascend into - heaven?’
45.10:6.w19-w22^that is, christ to bring down,
45.10:6.w21-w22^christ to bring down,
45.10:7.w1-w6^or, who will descend into the abyss?’
45.10:7.w7-w12^that is, christ out from [the] dead to bring up.
45.10:7.w9-w12^christ out from [the] dead to bring up.
45.10:8.w1-w3^but what says it?
45.10:8.w4-w17^near you the word is, in the mouth of you and in the heart of you.”
45.10:8.w18-w25^that is, the word - of faith which we proclaim,
45.10:8.w24-w25^which we proclaim,
45.10:9.w1-w9^that if you confess with the mouth of you, [the] lord [is] jesus,
45.10:9.w10-w15^and believe in the heart of you,
45.10:9.w16-w22^that - god him raised out from [the] dead,
45.10:9.w23_2^you will be saved.
45.11:1.w1-w2^i ask then,
45.11:1.w3-w9^not did reject - god the people of him?
45.11:1.w10-w11^never may it be!
45.11:1.w12-w21^also for i an israelite am, of [the] seed of abraham, of [the] tribe of benjamin.
45.11:10.w1-w7^let be darkened the eyes of them, - not to see,
45.11:10.w5-w7_2^- not to see,
45.11:10.w8-w14^and the backs of them, for ever bent over.”
45.11:11.w1-w2^i ask then,
45.11:11.w3-w4^not did they stumble
45.11:11.w5-w6^that they might fall?
45.11:11.w7-w8^never may it be!
45.11:11.w9-w20^but in the of them trespass - [is] salvation to the gentiles, so as - to provoke to jealousy them.
45.11:11.w17-w20^so as - to provoke to jealousy them.
45.11:12.w1-w7^if however, the trespass of them [is] riches of [the] world,
45.11:12.w8-w13^and the failure of them [is the] riches of [the] gentiles,
45.11:12.w14-w18^how much more the fullness of them!
45.11:13.w1-w5^to you now i am speaking, the gentiles.
45.11:13.w1^to you
45.11:13.w6-w13^upon as much as indeed therefore am i of [the] gentiles apostle,
45.11:13.w14-w17^the ministry of me i magnify,
45.11:14.w1-w6^if at all i shall provoke to jealousy of me the flesh,
45.11:14.w7-w11^and shall save some of them.
45.11:15.w1-w7^if for the rejection of them [is the] reconciliation of [the] world,
45.11:15.w8-w10^what [will be] the acceptance,
45.11:15.w11-w15^if not life out from [the] dead?
45.11:16.w1-w5^if now the firstfruit [is] holy,
45.11:16.w6-w8^also the lump;
45.11:16.w9-w13^and if the root [is] holy,
45.11:16.w14-w16^also the branches.
45.11:17.w1-w6^if however some of the branches were broken off,
45.11:17.w7-w13^you now, a wild olive tree being, were grafted in among them,
45.11:17.w9-w10^a wild olive tree being,
45.11:17.w14-w22^and a fellow-partaker of the root of the fatness of the olive tree have become,
45.11:18.w1-w4^not boast over the branches.
45.11:18.w5-w7^if now you boast against [them],
45.11:18.w8-w12^not you the root support,
45.11:18.w13-w16^but the root you.
45.11:19.w1-w2^you will say then,
45.11:19.w3-w4^were broken off branches,
45.11:19.w5-w7^that i might be grafted in.
45.11:2.w1-w7^not did reject - god the people of him,
45.11:2.w8-w9^whom he foreknew.
45.11:2.w10-w12^or not know you
45.11:2.w13-w18^in elijah what says the scripture,
45.11:2.w19-w25^how he pleads - with god against - israel:
45.11:20.w1_2^rightly so;
45.11:20.w2-w4^by the unbelief they were broken off;
45.11:20.w5-w9^you however - by faith stand.
45.11:20.w10-w12^not high be minded,
45.11:20.w13-w14^but be afraid.
45.11:21.w1-w10^if for - god the according to nature branches not spared,
45.11:21.w11-w15^not at all neither you will he spare.
45.11:22.w1-w6^behold therefore [the] kindness and severity of god;
45.11:22.w7-w10^upon indeed those having fallen,
45.11:22.w7^upon
45.11:22.w12-w16^toward however you, kindness of god,
45.11:22.w12^toward
45.11:22.w17-w20^if you continue in the kindness;
45.11:22.w21-w24^otherwise also you will be cut off.
45.11:23.w1-w8^even they now if not they continue - in unbelief, will be grafted in;
45.11:23.w3-w7^if not they continue - in unbelief,
45.11:23.w9-w16^able for is - god again to graft in them.
45.11:23.w14-w16^again to graft in them.
45.11:24.w1-w9^if for you, out of the according to nature were cut off a wild olive tree,
45.11:24.w4-w7^out of the according to nature
45.11:24.w10-w15^and, contrary to nature, were grafted into a cultivated olive tree,
45.11:24.w16-w25^how much more these, who according to nature [are], will be grafted into the own olive tree!
45.11:25.w1-w9^not for i want you to be ignorant, brothers, of the mystery this,
45.11:25.w5-w9^to be ignorant, brothers, of the mystery this,
45.11:25.w10-w15^that not you may be in yourselves wise,
45.11:25.w16-w22^that a hardening in part - to israel has happened,
45.11:25.w23-w29^until that the fullness of the gentiles may come in;
45.11:26.w1-w5^and so all israel will be saved,
45.11:26.w6-w7^as it has been written:
45.11:26.w8-w12^will come out of zion the [one] delivering,
45.11:26.w11-w12_2^the [one] delivering,
45.11:26.w13-w16^he will remove ungodliness from jacob.
45.11:27.w1-w7^and this [is] to them the from me covenant,
45.11:27.w8-w12^when i shall take away the sins of them.”
45.11:28.w1-w7^as regards indeed the gospel, [they are] enemies on account of you;
45.11:28.w1^as regards
45.11:28.w8-w15^as regards however the election, beloved on account of the patriarchs.
45.11:28.w8^as regards
45.11:29.w1-w9^irrevocable for [are] the gifts and the calling - of god.
45.11:3.w1-w5^lord, the prophets of you they have killed;
45.11:3.w6-w9^the altars of you they have torn down;
45.11:3.w10-w12^and i have been left alone,
45.11:3.w13-w17^and they are seeking the life of me.”
45.11:30.w1-w7^just as for you once were disobedient - to god,
45.11:30.w8-w13^now however have been shown mercy the of these disobedience,
45.11:31.w1-w8^so also these now have been disobedient, the for your mercy,
45.11:31.w9-w13^so that also they now may have mercy shown [them].
45.11:32.w1-w8^has bound up for - god - all in disobedience,
45.11:32.w9-w12^that - all he may show mercy to.
45.11:33.w1-w8_2^o, [the] depth of riches, both of wisdom and knowledge of god!
45.11:33.w9-w13^how unsearchable the judgments of him,
45.11:33.w14-w18^and untraceable the ways of him!
45.11:34.w1-w5^who for has known [the] mind of [the] lord,
45.11:34.w6-w10^or who counselor of him has been?”
45.11:35.w1-w4^or who has first given to him,
45.11:35.w5-w7^and it will be recompensed to him?”
45.11:36.w1-w11^for from him, and through him, and unto him - [are] all things.
45.11:36.w12-w18^to him [be] the glory to the ages! amen.
45.11:4.w1-w6^but what [was] spoken to him the divine answer?
45.11:4.w7-w10^i have left to myself seven thousand men
45.11:4.w11-w16^who not have bowed [the] knee - to baal.”
45.11:5.w1-w12^thus then also, in the present time, a remnant according to [the] election of grace there has been.
45.11:6.w1-w3^if now by grace,
45.11:6.w4-w6^no longer from works;
45.11:6.w7-w12^otherwise - grace no longer would be grace.
45.11:7.w1-w2^what then?
45.11:7.w3-w5^what is seeking israel,
45.11:7.w6-w8^this not it has obtained;
45.11:7.w9-w12^- but the elect obtained [it].
45.11:7.w9^-
45.11:7.w13-w16^the now rest were hardened,

45.4:9.w13-w14^we are saying for

45.5:1.w1-w4^having been justified therefore by faith,
45.5:10.w1-w13^if for, enemies being, we were reconciled - to god through the death of the son of him,
45.5:10.w3-w4^enemies being,
45.5:10.w14-w21^much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved in the life of him!
45.5:10.w16_2^having been reconciled,
45.5:11.w1-w3^not only [so] now,
45.5:11.w4-w15^but also we are rejoicing in - god through the lord of us jesus christ,

45.5:11.w16-w21^through whom now the reconciliation we have received.
45.5:12.w1-w12^because of this, just as through one man - sin into the world entered,
45.5:12.w13-w18^and through - sin, - death;
45.5:12.w19-w26^also thus to all men - death passed,
45.5:12.w27-w30^for that all sinned.
45.5:13.w1-w7^until for [the] law, sin was in [the] world;
45.5:13.w1^until

45.5:15.w10-w18^if for by the of the one trespass, the many died,
45.5:15.w19-w39^how much more the grace - of god and the gift in grace which [is] of the one man, jesus christ, to the many did abound!

45.5:19.w1-w12^for as for through the disobedience of the one man, sinners were made the many,

45.5:2.w1-w12^through whom also - access we have by the faith into the grace this
45.5:2.w13-w15^in which we stand;

45.5:21.w9-w24^so also - grace might reign through righteousness, unto life eternal, through jesus christ the lord of us.
45.5:3.w1-w3^not only [so] now,

45.5:5.w1-w5^- and hope not does make [us] ashamed,

45.5:6.w1-w12^yet indeed christ, being of us without strength still, according to [the] right time, for [the] ungodly died.
45.5:6.w4-w7^being of us without strength still,
45.5:7.w1-w6^rarely indeed for a righteous [man] anyone will die;
45.5:7.w7-w15^on behalf of though the good [man], perhaps someone even would dare to die.

45.5:8.w15-w18^christ for us died.
45.5:9.w1-w15^much therefore more, having been justified now by the blood of him, we will be saved by him from the wrath!
45.5:9.w1^much
45.5:9.w4-w9^having been justified now by the blood of him,
45.6:1.w1-w3^what then will we say?

45.6:15.w1-w2^what then?
45.6:15.w3_2^shall we sin
45.6:15.w4-w8^because not we are under law,
45.6:15.w9-w11^but under grace?
45.6:15.w12-w13^never may it be!
45.6:16.w1-w2^not know you

45.6:19.w9-w23^for as for you yielded the members of you in bondage - to impurity and to lawlessness unto - lawlessness,
45.6:19.w24-w34^so now yield the members of you in bondage - to righteousness unto sanctification.
45.6:2.w1-w2^never may it be!
45.6:2.w3-w6^who we died - to sin,

45.6:22.w7-w10^having become slaves now - to god,
45.6:22.w17-w21^- now the end [is] life eternal.
45.6:22.w17^-
45.6:23.w1-w6^the for wages - of sin [is] death;
45.6:23.w1^the

45.6:23.w7^-
45.6:3.w1-w2^or are you unaware
45.6:3.w3-w13^that as many as have been baptized into christ jesus, into the death of him have been baptized?
45.6:3.w4-w8^as many as have been baptized into christ jesus,
45.6:4.w1-w9^we were buried therefore with him through - baptism into - death,
45.6:4.w10-w20^so that just as was raised up christ out from [the] dead by the glory of the father,
45.6:4.w21-w27^so also we in newness of life should walk.
45.6:5.w1-w9^if for united we have become in the likeness of the death of him,
45.6:5.w3^united
45.6:5.w10-6.w2^certainly also of the resurrection we will be; this knowing,
45.6:6.w1-w2^this knowing,
45.6:6.w3-w8^that - old of us self was crucified with [him],
45.6:6.w9-w20^so that might be annulled the body - of sin, [that] no longer are enslaved we - to sin.

45.6:8.w1-w5^if now we died with christ,
45.6:8.w6_2^we believe
45.6:8.w7-9.w1^that also we will live with him, knowing
45.6:9.w1_2^knowing
45.6:9.w2-w8^that christ, having been raised up out from [the] dead, no more dies.
45.6:9.w4-w6^having been raised up out from [the] dead,
45.6:9.w9-w12^death him no longer rules over.
45.7:1.w1-w3^or are you ignorant, brothers —
45.7:1.w4_2^to those knowing
45.7:1.w8-w17^that the law rules over the man for as long as [the] time he is alive?
45.7:1.w14-w17^for as long as [the] time he is alive?
45.7:10.w1-w3^i then died.
45.7:10.w4-w14^and proved to be me the commandment that [was] to life, this to death.
45.7:11.w1-w10^the for sin, an occasion having taken by the commandment, deceived me,
45.7:11.w1^the
45.7:11.w4-w8^an occasion having taken by the commandment,
45.7:11.w11-w14^and by it put [me] to death.
45.7:12.w1-w5^so - indeed the law [is] holy,
45.7:12.w2^-
45.7:12.w6-w13^and the commandment [is] holy and righteous and good.
45.7:13.w1-w6^that which then [is] good, to me has become death?
45.7:13.w1^that which
45.7:13.w7-w8^never may it be!
45.7:13.w9-w11^but - sin,
45.7:13.w12-w20^in order that it might be shown to be sin, through that which [is] good to me is working out death;
45.7:13.w15-w20^through that which [is] good to me is working out death;
45.7:13.w21-w30^so that might become beyond excess sinful, - sin through the commandment.
45.7:14.w1-w2^we know for
45.7:14.w3-w7^that - [the] law spiritual is;
45.7:14.w8-w15^i however fleshly am, having been sold under - sin.
45.7:14.w12-w15^having been sold under - sin.
45.7:15.w1-w3^what for i do,
45.7:15.w6-w9^not for what i want,
45.7:15.w10-w11^this i do;

45.7:16.w6-w7^this i do,
45.7:16.w8-w10^i consent to the law,
45.7:16.w11-w12^that [it is] good.

45.7:17.w7-w12^but the dwelling in me sin.
45.7:17.w9-w11^dwelling in me
45.7:18.w1-w2^i know for

45.7:21.w11-w15^that me - evil is present with.
45.7:22.w1-w10^i delight for in the law - of god, according to the inward man;

45.8:15.w9-w12^but you have received [the] spirit of divine adoption as sons,

45.8:15.w16-w18_2^abba! - father!
45.8:16.w1-w7^himself the spirit bears witness with the spirit of us

45.8:17.w14-w16^so that also we may be glorified together.
45.8:18.w1-w2^i reckon for
45.8:18.w3-w17^that not comparable the sufferings of the present time [are] to the coming glory to be revealed to us.
45.8:19.w1-w12^the for earnest expectation of the creation, the revelation of the sons - of god awaits.
45.8:19.w1^the
45.8:2.w1-w20^- for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has set free you from the law - of sin and - of death.
45.8:2.w1^-
45.8:20.w1-w14^to the for futility, the creation was subjected, not willingly, but because of the [one] having subjected [it], in hope

45.8:20.w9-w12^but because of the [one] having subjected [it],
45.8:21.w1-w20^that also itself the creation will be set free from the bondage - of decay, into the freedom of the glory of the children - of god.
45.8:22.w1-w2^we know for
45.8:22.w3-w7^that all the creation groans together
45.8:22.w8-w12^and travails together until - now.
45.8:23.w1-w3^not only [so] now,
45.8:23.w4-w24^but even ourselves, the firstfruit of the spirit having, we also ourselves in ourselves groan, divine adoption as sons awaiting, the redemption of the body of us.

45.8:25.w7-w9^in patience we await.
45.8:26.w1-w9^likewise now also, the spirit joins to help the weakness of us;

45.8:28.w1-w2^we know now

45.8:3.w1-w5^- for powerless [being] the law,
45.8:3.w1^-
45.8:3.w6-w11^in that it was weak through the flesh,
45.8:3.w12-w30^- god, - of himself son having sent, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, condemned - sin in the flesh,
45.8:3.w14-w24^- of himself son having sent, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin,
45.8:30.w1-w3^those whom then he predestined,
45.8:30.w4-w6^these also he called;
45.8:30.w7-w9^and whom he called,
45.8:30.w10-w12^these also he justified;
45.8:30.w13-w15^whom then he justified,
45.8:30.w16-w18^these also he glorified.
45.8:31.w1-w5^what then will we say to these things?
45.8:31.w6-w10^if - god [is] for us,
45.8:31.w11-w13^who [can be] against us?
45.8:32.w1-w7^he who indeed the own son not spared,
45.8:32.w8-w13^but for us all gave up him,
45.8:32.w14-w22^how not also with him, things all us will he grant?
45.8:33.w1-w5^who will bring an accusation against [the] elect of god?
45.8:33.w6-w8^god [is] the [one] justifying.
45.8:33.w7-w8_2^the [one] justifying.
45.8:34.w1-w3^who [is] the [one] condemning?
45.8:34.w2-w3_2^the [one] condemning?
45.8:34.w4-w10_2^[for it is] christ jesus, the [one] having died, rather now having been raised up,
45.8:34.w6-w7_2^the [one] having died,
45.8:34.w8-w10^rather now having been raised up,
45.8:34.w11-w17^who also is at [the] right hand - of god,
45.8:34.w18-w22^who and is interceding for us.

45.8:35.w9-w21_2^tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?
45.8:36.w1-w2^as it has been written
45.8:36.w3-w9^-: for the sake of you, we face death all the day;
45.8:36.w10-w13^we were regarded as sheep of slaughter.”
45.8:37.w1-w9^but in these things all, we more than conquer through the [one] having loved us.
45.8:37.w6-w9^through the [one] having loved us.
45.8:38.w1-w2^i am persuaded for
45.8:38.w3-39.w23^that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any created thing other, will be able us to separate from the love - of god - in christ jesus the lord of us.
45.8:38.w12-w13_2^nor things present,
45.8:38.w14-w15_2^nor things to come,
45.8:39.w10-w23^us to separate from the love - of god - in christ jesus the lord of us.
45.8:4.w1-w16^so that the righteousness of the law should be fulfilled in us - not according to the flesh walking, but according to [the] spirit.
45.8:4.w9-w13^- not according to the flesh walking,
45.8:4.w9^-
45.8:4.w14-w16_2^but according to [the] spirit.
45.8:5.w1-w5^those for according to flesh being,
45.8:5.w1^those
45.8:5.w10-w16^those however according to spirit, the things of the spirit.
45.8:5.w10^those
45.8:6.w1-w6^the for mind of the flesh [is] death;
45.8:6.w1^the
45.8:6.w7-w14^the but mind of the spirit, life and peace,
45.8:6.w7^the
45.8:7.w1-w8^because the mind of the flesh [is] hostility toward god;
45.8:7.w9-w15^to for [the] law - of god not it is subject,
45.8:7.w9^to
45.8:7.w16-w18^nor even for can it [be].
45.8:8.w1-w5^those now in flesh being,
45.8:8.w1^those
45.8:8.w6-w7^god to please
45.8:9.w1-w6^you now not are in flesh,
45.8:9.w7-w9^but in spirit,
45.8:9.w10-w15^if indeed [the] spirit of god dwells in you;
45.8:9.w16-w22^if however anyone [the] spirit of christ not has,
45.8:9.w23-w26^he not is of him.
45.9:1.w1-w4^[the] truth i speak in christ.
45.9:1.w5-w6^not i am lying,
45.9:1.w7-w14^bearing witness with me the conscience of me in [the] spirit holy,
45.9:10.w1-w3^not only then,
45.9:10.w4-w14^but also rebecca, by one conception, having isaac the father of us,
45.9:10.w7-w14^by one conception, having isaac the father of us,
45.9:10.w7-w8^by one
45.9:11.w1-w3^not yet for having been born,
45.9:11.w4-w9^nor having done anything good or evil,
45.9:11.w10-12.w7^so that the according to election purpose - of god might stand, not of works, but of the [one] calling,
45.9:12.w4-w7_2^but of the [one] calling,
45.9:12.w8-w9^it was said to her
45.9:12.w10-w15^-, the older will serve the younger.”
45.9:13.w1-w2^as it has been written
45.9:13.w3-w5^-: jacob i loved,
45.9:13.w6-w9^- but esau i hated.”
45.9:13.w6^-
45.9:14.w1-w3^what then shall we say?
45.9:14.w4-w8^not injustice with - god [is there]?
45.9:14.w9-w10^never may it be!
45.9:15.w1-w4^to moses for he says:
45.9:15.w5-w8^i will show mercy to whom - i may show mercy,
45.9:15.w6-w8^whom - i may show mercy,
45.9:15.w9-w13^and i will have compassion on whom - i may have compassion.”
45.9:15.w11-w13^whom - i may have compassion.”
45.9:16.w1-w12^so then, [it is] not of the willing, nor of the running, but - showing mercy of god.
45.9:16.w4-w5_2^of the willing,
45.9:16.w6-w8_2^nor of the running,
45.9:16.w11_2^showing mercy
45.9:17.w1-w6^says for the scripture to pharaoh
45.9:17.w7-w12^-: for this very therefore i have raised up you,
45.9:17.w13-w19^so that i might show in you the power of me,
45.9:17.w20-w29^and that should be declared the name of me in all the earth.”
45.9:18.w1-w5^so then, to whom he wants, he shows mercy;
45.9:18.w3-w4^to whom he wants,
45.9:18.w6-w8^whom now he wants,
45.9:19.w1-w3^you will say to me then,
45.9:19.w4-w7^why then still does he find fault?
45.9:19.w8-w13^the for purpose of him, who is resisting?
45.9:19.w8^the
45.9:2.w1-w5^that grief to me is great,
45.9:2.w6-w11^and unceasing sorrow in the heart of me.
45.9:20.w1-w10^o man, but rather, you who are - answering against - god?
45.9:20.w7-w10^- answering against - god?
45.9:20.w11-w16^not will say the thing formed to the [one] having formed [it],
45.9:20.w15-w16_2^to the [one] having formed [it],
45.9:20.w17-w20^why me have you made like this?”
45.9:21.w1-w22^or not has authority the potter over the clay, out of the same lump to make one indeed unto honor vessel, one however unto dishonor?
45.9:21.w4^authority
45.9:21.w9-w22^out of the same lump to make one indeed unto honor vessel, one however unto dishonor?
45.9:21.w14-w17^one indeed unto honor
45.9:21.w19-w22^one however unto dishonor?
45.9:22.w1-w22^what if now desiring - god to show the wrath and to make known the power of him, bore with much patience, [the] vessels of wrath, having been fitted for destruction,
45.9:22.w3-w13^desiring - god to show the wrath and to make known the power of him,
45.9:22.w6-w8^to show the wrath
45.9:22.w9-w13^and to make known the power of him,
45.9:22.w20-w22^having been fitted for destruction,
45.9:23.w1-w11^also that he might make known the riches of the glory of him upon [the] vessels of mercy,
45.9:23.w12-w15^which he prepared beforehand for glory,
45.9:24.w1-w12^whom even he has called, us not only out from [the] jews, but also out from [the] gentiles?
45.9:24.w1^whom
45.9:25.w1-w6^as also in - hosea he says:
45.9:25.w7-w13^i will call that which [is] not people of me, people of me;
45.9:25.w9^not

45.9:28.w3_2^concluding
45.9:28.w4-w5^and bringing swiftly,
45.9:29.w1-w4^and, as foretold isaiah:
45.9:29.w5-w11^if not [the] lord of hosts had left us descendants,
45.9:29.w12-w15^like sodom - we would have become,
45.9:29.w16-w20^and like gomorrah - we would have been made.”
45.9:3.w1-w18^could wish for a curse to be myself i, separated from - christ for the brothers of me, - kinsmen of me, according to [the] flesh;
45.9:3.w3-w4^a curse to be
45.9:30.w1-w3^what then will we say?
45.9:30.w4-w11^that gentiles - not pursuing righteousness, have attained righteousness,

46.1:26.w13-w15^not many powerful,
46.1:26.w16-w18^not many of noble birth.
46.1:27.w1-w8^but the foolish things of the world has chosen - god
46.1:27.w9-w12^that he might shame the wise;
46.1:27.w13-w20^and the weak things of the world chose - god

46.10:7.w9-w14^sat down the people to eat and to drink,
46.10:7.w12_2^to eat
46.10:7.w13-w14^and to drink,
46.10:7.w15-w17^and rose up to play.”
46.10:7.w17_2^to play.”
46.10:8.w1-w2^neither should we commit sexual immorality,
46.10:8.w3-w6^as some of them committed sexual immorality,
46.10:8.w7-w13^and fell in one day twenty three thousand.
46.10:9.w1-w4^neither should we test the christ,
46.10:9.w5-w8^as some of them tested,

46.11:1.w1-w3^imitators of me be,
46.11:1.w4-w6^as i also [am] of christ.
46.11:10.w1-w13^because of this, ought the woman authority to have on the head, on account of the angels.
46.11:10.w6-w13^authority to have on the head, on account of the angels.
46.11:11.w1-w5^however, neither [is] woman separate from man,

46.11:12.w1-w7^just as for the woman of the man [is],
46.11:12.w8-w14^so also the man by the woman [is];
46.11:12.w15-w20^the however all things of - god.
46.11:12.w15^the
46.11:13.w1-w4^in you yourselves judge:
46.11:13.w5-w11^becoming is it for a woman revealed, - to god to pray?
46.11:13.w7-w11^for a woman revealed, - to god to pray?
46.11:14.w1-w6^not even - nature itself does teach you
46.11:14.w7-w11^that a man indeed, if he has long hair,
46.11:14.w12-w14^a dishonor to him it is;
46.11:15.w1-w4^a woman however if she has long hair,
46.11:15.w5-w7^glory to her it is?
46.11:15.w8-w14^for the long hair instead of a covering is given to her.
46.11:16.w1-w6^if now anyone is inclined contentious to be,
46.11:16.w5-w6^contentious to be,
46.11:16.w7-w11^we such custom no [other] have,
46.11:16.w12-w16^nor the churches - of god.
46.11:17.w1-w3^in this now instructing,
46.11:17.w6-w15^because not for the better, but for the worse, you come together.
46.11:18.w1-w12^first indeed, for coming together you in an assembly, i hear divisions among you there to be,
46.11:18.w4-w7^coming together you in an assembly,
46.11:18.w4-w7_2^coming together you in an assembly,
46.11:18.w13-w16^and in part it i believe.
46.11:19.w1-w7^it behooves for also factions among you there to be,
46.11:19.w3-w7^also factions among you there to be,
46.11:19.w8-w15^so that also the approved, evident should become among you.
46.11:2.w1-w3^i commend now you
46.11:2.w4-w7^that in all things me you have remembered,
46.11:2.w8-w13^and as i delivered to you, the teachings
46.11:2.w14_2^you are keeping.
46.11:20.w1-w6^coming therefore of you together in one place,
46.11:20.w7-w11^not it is [the] lord’s supper to eat.
46.11:20.w9-w11^[the] lord’s supper to eat.
46.11:21.w1-w9^one for the own supper takes first in - eating;
46.11:21.w7-w9_2^in - eating;
46.11:21.w10-w13^and this [one] indeed is hungry,
46.11:21.w14-w16^that [one] however is drunken.
46.11:22.w1-w10^no indeed houses not have you in which to eat and to drink?
46.11:22.w6-w8_2^in which to eat
46.11:22.w9-w10^and to drink?
46.11:22.w11-w16^or the church - of god do you despise
46.11:22.w17-w21^and put to shame those nothing having?
46.11:22.w19-w21^those nothing having?
46.11:22.w19^those
46.11:22.w22-w24^what shall i say to you?
46.11:22.w25-w28^shall i praise you in this?
46.11:22.w29-w30^not i praise [you]!
46.11:23.w1-w10^i for received from the lord that which also i delivered to you,
46.11:23.w7-w10^that which also i delivered to you,
46.11:23.w11-w21^that the lord jesus in the night in which he was betrayed, took bread,
46.11:23.w18-w19^in which he was betrayed,
46.11:24.w1-w3^and having given thanks, he broke [it]
46.11:24.w2_2^having given thanks,
46.11:24.w4-w5^and said,
46.11:24.w6-w13^this of me is the body, which [is] for you;
46.11:24.w7^of me
46.11:24.w14-w19^this do in - of me remembrance.
46.11:25.w1-w8^likewise also the cup, after - having supped, saying,
46.11:25.w5-w7_2^after - having supped,
46.11:25.w8_2^saying,
46.11:25.w9-w19^this - cup the new covenant is in - my blood;
46.11:25.w12-w14^the new covenant
46.11:25.w20-w28^this do, as often as if you might drink [it], in - of me remembrance.
46.11:25.w22-w24^as often as if you might drink [it],
46.11:26.w1-w7^as often as for if you may eat the bread this,
46.11:26.w8-w11^and the cup may drink,
46.11:26.w12-w19^the death of the lord you proclaim until that he should come.
46.11:26.w17-w19^until that he should come.
46.11:27.w1-w22^therefore whoever - should eat the bread or should drink the cup of the lord unworthily, guilty will be of the body and of the blood of the lord.
46.11:27.w2-w6^whoever - should eat the bread
46.11:27.w7-w13^or should drink the cup of the lord unworthily,
46.11:27.w14^guilty
46.11:28.w1-w4^let examine however a man himself,
46.11:28.w5-w10^and in this manner of the bread let him eat,
46.11:28.w11-w15^and of the cup let him drink.
46.11:29.w1-w3^the [one] for eating

46.11:29.w9-w14^and drinks not discerning the body.
46.11:29.w11-w14^not discerning the body.
46.11:3.w1-w4^i want however you to know
46.11:3.w4_2^to know
46.11:3.w5-w12^that of every man the head - christ is,
46.11:3.w13-w17^[the] head now of [the] woman [is] the man,

46.11:30.w9-w11^and are fallen asleep many.
46.11:31.w1-w4^if for ourselves we were judging,
46.11:31.w5-w7^not - we would come under judgment.

46.11:32.w7-w12^so that not with the world we should be condemned.

46.12:11.w14-w15^as he wills.
46.12:12.w1-w6^just as for the body one is,
46.12:12.w7-w10^and members many has,
46.12:12.w11-w21^all now the members of the body, many being, one are body;
46.12:12.w11^all
46.12:12.w17-w18^many being,
46.12:12.w19^one
46.12:12.w22-w25^so also [is] - christ.
46.12:13.w1-w19^also for in one spirit, we all into one body were baptized, whether jews or greeks, whether slaves or free;
46.12:13.w6-w7^we all
46.12:13.w20-w24^and all one spirit we were made to drink.
46.12:14.w1-w8^also for the body not is one member,
46.12:14.w9-w10^but many.
46.12:15.w1-w4^if should say the foot,
46.12:15.w5-w8^because not i am a hand,
46.12:15.w9-w13^not i am of the body,
46.12:15.w14-w21^not on account of this, not is it of the body.
46.12:16.w1-w5^and if should say the ear,
46.12:16.w6-w9^because not i am an eye,
46.12:16.w10-w14^not i am of the body,
46.12:16.w15-w22^not on account of this, not is it of the body.
46.12:17.w1-w5^if all the body [were] an eye,
46.12:17.w6-w8^where [would be] the hearing?
46.12:17.w9-w11^if all [were] hearing,
46.12:17.w12-w14^where [would be] the sense of smell?
46.12:18.w1-w13^now however, - god has arranged the members, one each of them in the body,
46.12:18.w14-w15^as he desired.
46.12:19.w1-w7^if now were - all one member,
46.12:19.w8-w10^where [would be] the body?
46.12:2.w1_2^you know
46.12:2.w2-w4^that when pagans
46.12:2.w5-w14^you were, to - idols - mute, even as - you were led, being carried away.
46.12:2.w6-w14^to - idols - mute, even as - you were led, being carried away.
46.12:2.w11-w13^even as - you were led,
46.12:20.w1-w5^now however, many even [are the] members,
46.12:20.w6-w8^one however body.
46.12:21.w1-w8^not is able now the eye to say to the hand,
46.12:21.w6-w8^to say to the hand,
46.12:21.w9-w12^need of you not i have.
46.12:21.w13-w18^or again the head to the feet,
46.12:21.w17-w18_2^to the feet,
46.12:21.w19-w22^need of you not i have.
46.12:22.w1-w12^but much rather, those seeming members of the body weaker to be, indispensable are;
46.12:22.w9-w10^weaker to be,
46.12:23.w1-w7^and those which we think less honorable to be of the body,
46.12:23.w2_2^those which
46.12:23.w4^less honorable
46.12:23.w8-w11^these honor more abundant we bestow;
46.12:23.w12-w18^and the unpresentable [parts] of us, decorum more abundant have;
46.12:24.w1-w7^- and the presentable [parts] of us, no need have.
46.12:24.w1^-
46.12:24.w8-w18^but - god has composed the body, to the [parts] being deficient more abundant having given honor,
46.12:24.w14-w15_2^to the [parts] being deficient
46.12:24.w16^more abundant
46.12:25.w1-w7^that not there should be division in the body,
46.12:25.w8-w15^but the same for one another should have concern, the members.
46.12:26.w1-w5^and if suffers one member,
46.12:26.w6-w9^suffer with [it] all the members;
46.12:26.w10-w13^if is honored one member,
46.12:26.w14-w17^rejoice with [it] all the members.
46.12:27.w1-w5^you now are [the] body of christ,
46.12:27.w6-w9^and members in particular.
46.12:28.w1-w9^and some indeed has appointed - god in the church,
46.12:28.w10-w11^first apostles,
46.12:28.w12-w13^secondly prophets,
46.12:28.w14-w15^third teachers,
46.12:28.w16-w17^then miracles,
46.12:28.w18-w24^then gifts of healing, helping, administrating, various kinds of tongues.
46.12:29.w1-w3^not [are] all apostles?
46.12:29.w4-w6^not all prophets?
46.12:29.w7-w9^not all teachers?
46.12:29.w10-w12^not [have] all miracles?
46.12:3.w1-w3^therefore i make known to you
46.12:3.w4-w10^that no one in [the] spirit of god speaking, says
46.12:3.w6-w9^in [the] spirit of god speaking,
46.12:3.w11-w12^accursed [is] jesus,
46.12:3.w13-w16^and no one is able to say,
46.12:3.w16_2^to say,
46.12:3.w17-w18^lord [is] jesus,
46.12:3.w19-w23^if not in [the] spirit holy.
46.12:30.w1-w5^not all gifts have of healings?
46.12:30.w3^gifts
46.12:30.w6-w9^not all in tongues do speak?
46.12:30.w10-w12^not all do interpret?
46.12:31.w1-w6^be desirous of however the gifts - greater.
46.12:31.w7-w13^and now, according to a more surpassing way, to you i show.
46.12:4.w1-w4^varieties now of gifts there are,
46.12:4.w1^varieties
46.12:4.w5-w8^- but the same spirit;
46.12:4.w5^-
46.12:5.w1-w4^and varieties of services there are,
46.12:5.w5-w8^but the same lord;
46.12:6.w1-w4^and varieties of workings there are,
46.12:6.w5-w14^the but same god - is working the all things in everyone.
46.12:6.w5^the
46.12:6.w9-w14^- is working the all things in everyone.
46.12:7.w1-w10^to each now is given the manifestation of the spirit for the common profiting.
46.12:8.w1-w9^to one truly for through the spirit is given a word of wisdom,
46.12:8.w10-w17^to another now a word of knowledge, according to the same spirit,
46.12:9.w1-w6^and to a different one, faith by the same spirit,
46.12:9.w7-w14^to another now gifts of healing in that one spirit,
46.13:1.w1-w9^if in the tongues - of men i speak, and - of angels,
46.13:1.w2-w5^in the tongues - of men
46.13:1.w10-w13^love however not have,
46.13:1.w14-w19^i have become a brass sounding, or a cymbal clanging.
46.13:1.w16_2^sounding,
46.13:1.w19_2^clanging.
46.13:10.w1-w5^when however should come the perfect,
46.13:10.w6-w9^the in part will be done away.
46.13:11.w1-w3^when i was a child,
46.13:11.w4-w6^i was speaking like a child,
46.13:11.w7-w9^i was thinking like a child,
46.13:11.w10-w12^i was reasoning like a child;
46.13:11.w13-w15^when i became a man,
46.13:11.w16-w19^i did away with the things of the child.
46.13:12.w1-w7^we see for presently, through a glass in obscurity;
46.13:12.w8-w12^then however, face to face;
46.13:12.w13-w16^presently, i know in part;
46.13:12.w17-w19^then however i will know fully,
46.13:12.w20-w22^as also i have been fully known.
46.13:13.w1-w9^now however abide faith, hope, love, the things three these;
46.13:13.w10-w14^[the] greatest however of these [is] - love.
46.13:13.w10^[the] greatest
46.13:2.w1-w4^and if i should have prophecy
46.13:2.w5-w13^and understand the mysteries all, and all the knowledge,
46.13:2.w14-w19^and if i should have all the faith,
46.13:2.w20-w22^so as mountains to remove,
46.13:2.w20_2^so as
46.13:2.w23-w26^love however not have,
46.13:2.w27-w28^nothing i am.
46.13:3.w1-w6^even if i may give away all the possessions of me,
46.13:3.w3-w6_2^all the possessions of me,
46.13:3.w7-w12^and if i may deliver up the body of me
46.13:3.w13-w14^that i may boast,
46.13:3.w15-w18^love however not have,
46.13:3.w19-w20^nothing i am profited.
46.13:4.w1-w3^- love is patient,
46.13:4.w4-w6^is kind; - love
46.13:4.w7-w10^not is envious; - love
46.13:4.w11-w12^not is boastful,
46.13:4.w13-w14^not is puffed up,
46.13:5.w1-w2^not acts unbecomingly;
46.13:5.w3-w6^not seeks the things of its own,
46.13:5.w7-w8^not is easily provoked,
46.13:5.w9-w12^not it keeps account - of wrongs;
46.13:6.w1-w5^not delights at - unrighteousness,
46.13:6.w6-w9^rejoices however in the truth.
46.13:7.w1-w2^all things it bears,
46.13:7.w3-w4^all things believes,
46.13:7.w5-w6^all things hopes,
46.13:7.w7-w8^all things endures.
46.13:8.w1-w4^- love never fails;
46.13:8.w5-w7^if however [there are] prophesies,
46.13:8.w8_2^they will be done away;
46.13:8.w9-w10^if tongues,
46.13:8.w11_2^they will be ceased;
46.13:8.w12-w13^if knowledge
46.13:8.w14_2^it will pass away.
46.13:9.w1-w4^in part for we know,
46.13:9.w5-w8^and in part we prophesy;
46.14:1.w1-w3^earnestly pursue - love;
46.14:1.w4-w7^earnestly desire now - spiritual gifts,
46.14:1.w8-w11^especially now that you might prophesy.
46.14:10.w1-w8^so many if it may be kinds of languages there are in [the] world,
46.14:10.w2-w3^if it may be
46.14:10.w1^so many
46.14:10.w9-w11^and none without meaning.
46.14:11.w1-w8^if therefore not i know the power of the sound,
46.14:11.w9-w12^i will be to the [one] speaking a foreigner,
46.14:11.w10-w11_2^to the [one] speaking
46.14:11.w13-w18^and the [one] speaking to me a foreigner.
46.14:11.w14-w15_2^the [one] speaking
46.14:12.w1-w7^so also you, since zealous you are of spiritual gifts,
46.14:12.w5^zealous
46.14:12.w8-w13^for the edification of the church, search
46.14:12.w14-w15^that you should cause [it] to abound.
46.14:13.w1-w5^therefore the [one] speaking in a tongue, let him pray
46.14:13.w2-w4^the [one] speaking in a tongue,
46.14:13.w6-w7^that he might interpret.
46.14:14.w1-w4^if for i pray in a tongue,
46.14:14.w5-w8^the spirit of me prays,
46.14:14.w9-w14^- but the mind of me unfruitful is.
46.14:14.w9^-
46.14:15.w1-w3^what then is it?
46.14:15.w4-w6^i will pray with the spirit,
46.14:15.w7-w11^i will pray however also with the mind.
46.14:15.w12-w14^i will sing praise with the spirit,
46.14:15.w15-w19^i will sing praise however also with the mind.
46.14:16.w1-w5^otherwise if you bless with the spirit,
46.14:16.w6-w11^the [one] filling the place of the uninstructed,
46.14:16.w20-w24^since what you say not he knows?
46.14:16.w21-w22^what you say
46.14:17.w1-w5^you truly for well are giving thanks,
46.14:17.w6-w10^but the other not is edified.
46.14:18.w1-w3^i thank - god
46.14:18.w4-w8^than all of you more, in tongues speaking;
46.14:19.w1-w10^but in [the] church, i desire five words with [the] mind of me to speak
46.14:19.w2-w3_2^in [the] church,
46.14:19.w11-w14^that also others i might instruct,
46.14:19.w15-w19^rather than ten thousand words in a tongue.
46.14:2.w1-w4^the [one] for speaking in a tongue,
46.14:2.w1^the [one]
46.14:2.w8-w9^but to god;
46.14:2.w10-w12^no one for hears;
46.14:2.w13-w16^in the spirit however, he utters mysteries.
46.14:20.w1-w6^brothers, not children be in the minds.
46.14:20.w7-w10^yet in the evil, be little children;
46.14:20.w11-w15^in the however thinking, full grown be.
46.14:20.w11^in the
46.14:21.w1-w4^in the law it has been written
46.14:21.w5-w15^-: by other tongues, and by lips other, i will speak to the people this,
46.14:21.w16-w20^and not even thus will they hear me,
46.14:21.w21-w22^says [the] lord.”
46.14:22.w1-w9^so then - tongues for a sign are, not to those believing,
46.14:22.w8-w9_2^to those believing,
46.14:22.w10-w12^but to the unbelieving;
46.14:22.w13-w18^- but prophecy [is] not to the unbelieving,
46.14:22.w13^-
46.14:22.w19-w21^but to the believing.
46.14:22.w20-w21_2^to the believing.
46.14:23.w1-w9^if therefore gathers the church whole together the place,
46.14:23.w10-w13^and all should speak in tongues,
46.14:23.w14-w18^come in however uninstructed ones or unbelievers,
46.14:23.w19-w20^not will they say
46.14:23.w21-w22^that you are mad?
46.14:24.w1-w4^if however all prophesy,
46.14:24.w5-w10^should come in then some unbeliever or uninstructed,
46.14:24.w11-w13^he is convicted by all,
46.14:24.w14-w16^he is examined by all,
46.14:25.w1-w7^the secrets of the heart of him manifest become.
46.14:25.w8-w16^and thus having fallen upon [his] face, he will worship - god, declaring
46.14:25.w10-w12^having fallen upon [his] face,
46.14:25.w16_2^declaring
46.14:25.w17-w23^that certainly - god among you is.
46.14:26.w1-w4^what then is it, brothers?
46.14:26.w5-w6^when you may come together,
46.14:26.w7-w9^each a psalm has,
46.14:26.w10-w11^a teaching has,
46.14:26.w12-w13^a revelation has,
46.14:26.w14-w15^a tongue has,
46.14:26.w16-w17^an interpretation has.
46.14:26.w18-w21^all things for edification let be done.
46.14:27.w1-w4^if with a tongue anyone speaks,
46.14:27.w5-w13_2^[let it be] by two or the most three, and in turn;
46.14:27.w14-w16^and one let interpret.
46.14:28.w1-w5^if however not there is an interpreter,
46.14:28.w6-w8^let him be silent in [the] church;
46.14:28.w9-w14^to himself then let him speak, and - to god.
46.14:28.w9_2^to himself
46.14:29.w1-w6^prophets then, two or three let speak,
46.14:29.w1^prophets
46.14:29.w7-w10^and the others let discern.
46.14:3.w1-w3^the [one] however prophesying,
46.14:3.w1^the [one]
46.14:30.w1-w5^if however to another a revelation should be made sitting by,
46.14:30.w5_2^sitting by,
46.14:30.w6-w8^the first let be silent.
46.14:31.w1-w6^you are able for [one] by one all to prophesy,
46.14:31.w3-w4_2^[one] by one
46.14:31.w7-w9^so that all may learn
46.14:31.w10-w12^and all may be exhorted.
46.14:32.w1-w5^and spirits of prophets, to prophets are subject.
46.14:33.w1-w6^not for he is of disorder the god,
46.14:33.w7-w8^but of peace.
46.14:33.w9-34.w6^as in all the churches of the saints, the women in the churches let them be silent.
46.14:34.w7-w11^not for it is allowed to them to speak,
46.14:34.w11_2^to speak,
46.14:34.w12-w13^but to be in submission,
46.14:34.w14-w18^as also the law says.
46.14:35.w1-w5^if however anything to learn they desire,
46.14:35.w3-w4^anything to learn
46.14:35.w6-w11^at home the own husbands let them ask;
46.14:35.w12-w18^shameful for it is for a woman to speak in [the] church.
46.14:35.w16-w18^to speak in [the] church.
46.14:36.w1-w8^or from you the word - of god has gone out?
46.14:36.w9-w13^or to you only has it come?
46.14:37.w1-w7^if anyone considers a prophet himself to be, or spiritual,
46.14:37.w4-w7^a prophet himself to be, or spiritual,
46.14:37.w4_2^a prophet
46.14:37.w8-w11^let him recognize the things i write to you
46.14:37.w9-w11^the things i write to you
46.14:37.w12-w15^that of [the] lord are [the] commands.
46.14:37.w13^of [the] lord
46.14:38.w1-w4^if however anyone is ignorant,
46.14:38.w5_2^let him be ignored.
46.14:39.w1-w6^so, brothers of me, earnestly desire - to prophesy,
46.14:39.w5-w6_2^- to prophesy,
46.14:39.w7-w12^and - to speak not do forbid in tongues.
46.14:39.w8-w9_2^- to speak
46.14:4.w1-w3^the [one] speaking in a tongue,
46.14:4.w6-w8^the [one] however prophesying,
46.14:4.w6^the [one]
46.14:40.w1-w7^all things however properly and with order let be done.
46.14:5.w1-w6^i desire now all you to speak in tongues,
46.14:5.w3-w6^all you to speak in tongues,
46.14:5.w7-w10^rather however that you should prophesy;
46.14:5.w11-w14^greater [is] now the [one] prophesying
46.14:5.w13-w14_2^the [one] prophesying
46.14:5.w15-w18^than the [one] speaking in tongues,
46.14:5.w16-w18^the [one] speaking in tongues,
46.14:5.w19-w22^except if not he should interpret,
46.14:5.w23-w27^so that the church edification might receive.
46.14:6.w1-w12^now however brothers, if i should come to you in tongues speaking, what you will i profit,
46.14:6.w4-w9^if i should come to you in tongues speaking,
46.14:6.w8-w9^in tongues speaking,
46.14:6.w13-w28^if not to you i should speak either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in teaching?
46.14:7.w1-w15^even - lifeless things a sound giving, whether flute or harp, if distinction to the sounds not they give,

46.14:7.w16-w22^how will it be known what [is] being piped or - being harped?
46.14:7.w18-w19_2^what [is] being piped
46.14:7.w20-w22^or - being harped?
46.14:8.w1-w7^also for if indistinct [the] trumpet sound gives,
46.14:8.w4^indistinct
46.14:8.w8-w11^who will prepare himself for battle?
46.14:9.w1-w11^so also you, with the tongue if not intelligible speech you give,
46.14:9.w12-w15^how will it be known what [is] being spoken?
46.14:9.w14-w15_2^what [is] being spoken?
46.14:9.w16-w20^you will be for into [the] air speaking.
46.14:9.w18-w20^into [the] air speaking.
46.15:1.w1-w6^i make known now to you, brothers, the gospel
46.15:1.w7-w9^that i proclaimed to you,
46.15:1.w10-w12^which also you received,
46.15:1.w13-w16^in which also you stand,
46.15:10.w1-w6^[by the] grace however of god, i am what i am,
46.15:10.w1^[by the] grace
46.15:10.w5-w6^what i am,
46.15:10.w7-w16^and the grace of him - toward me not void has been.
46.15:10.w17-w21^rather, more abundantly than them all i toiled,
46.15:10.w22-w32^not i however, but the grace - of god that [was] with me.
46.15:10.w22-w23_2^not i
46.15:11.w1-w5^whether therefore i or they,
46.15:11.w6-w7^thus we preach,
46.15:11.w8-w10^and thus you believed.
46.15:12.w1-w4^if now christ is preached
46.15:12.w5-w8^that out from [the] dead he has been raised,
46.15:12.w9-w13^how say among you some
46.15:12.w14-w18^that a resurrection of [the] dead not there is?
46.15:13.w1-w6^if however a resurrection of [the] dead not there is,
46.15:13.w7-w9^neither christ has been raised;
46.15:14.w1-w5^if then christ not has been raised,
46.15:14.w6-w11^[is] void then also the preaching of us,
46.15:14.w12-w16^void also the faith of you.
46.15:15.w1-w6^we are found then also false witnesses - of god,
46.15:15.w7-w11^because we have witnessed concerning - god,
46.15:15.w12-w15^that he raised up - christ,
46.15:15.w16-w18^whom not he has raised
46.15:15.w19-w23^if then [the] dead not are raised.
46.15:16.w1-w5^if for [the] dead not are raised,
46.15:16.w6-w8^neither christ has been raised;
46.15:17.w1-w5^if then christ not has been raised,
46.15:17.w6-w9^[is] futile the faith of you
46.15:17.w10-w15^still you are in the sins of you.
46.15:18.w1-w7^then also those having fallen asleep in christ have perished.
46.15:18.w3-w6^those having fallen asleep in christ
46.15:19.w1-w10^if in the life this, in christ having hope we are, only,
46.15:19.w2-w8^in the life this, in christ having hope
46.15:19.w11-w14^more to be pitied than all men we are.
46.15:2.w1-w4^by which also you are being saved,
46.15:2.w5-w8^to the word i proclaimed to you,
46.15:2.w9-w10^if you hold fast;
46.15:2.w11-w15^unless if not, in vain you have believed.
46.15:20.w1-w9^now however christ has been raised out from [the] dead, firstfruit of those having fallen asleep.
46.15:20.w3^christ
46.15:20.w8-w9_2^of those having fallen asleep.
46.15:21.w1-w5^since for by a man [came] death,
46.15:21.w6-w10^also by a man resurrection of [the] dead.
46.15:22.w1-w7^for as indeed in - adam all die,
46.15:22.w8-w14^so also in - christ, all will be made alive.
46.15:23.w1-w6^each however in the own order:
46.15:23.w7-w8_2^[the] firstfruit christ,
46.15:23.w9-w16^then those of christ at the coming of him;
46.15:24.w1-w3^then the end,
46.15:24.w4-w11^when he shall hand over the kingdom to the god and father,
46.15:24.w12-w20^when he shall have annulled all dominion and all authority and power.
46.15:25.w1-w14^it behooves for him to reign until that he shall have put all the enemies under the feet of him.
46.15:25.w3-w14^him to reign until that he shall have put all the enemies under the feet of him.
46.15:25.w5-w14^until that he shall have put all the enemies under the feet of him.
46.15:26.w1-w5^[the] last enemy to be abolished [is] - death.
46.15:26.w1-w2^[the] last enemy
46.15:27.w1-w7^all things,” for he has put in subjection, under the feet of him.”
46.15:27.w8-w10^when however it may be said
46.15:27.w11-w13^that all things have been put in subjection,
46.15:27.w14_2^[it is] evident
46.15:27.w15-w21^that [is] excepted the [one] having put in subjection to him - all things.
46.15:27.w16-w21^[is] excepted the [one] having put in subjection to him - all things.
46.15:28.w1-w6^when now shall have been put in subjection to him - all things,
46.15:28.w7-w17^then also himself the son will be put in subjection to the [one] having put in subjection to him - all things,
46.15:28.w13-w17^to the [one] having put in subjection to him - all things,
46.15:28.w18-w25^so that may be - god - all in all.
46.15:29.w1-w8^otherwise what will they do who are baptized for the dead?
46.15:29.w4-w8^who are baptized for the dead?
46.15:29.w9-w13^if at all [the] dead not are raised,
46.15:29.w14-w18^why also are they baptized for them?
46.15:3.w1-w8^i delivered for to you in the foremost what also i received,
46.15:3.w6-w8^what also i received,
46.15:3.w9-w18^that christ died for the sins of us according to the scriptures,
46.15:30.w1-w6^why also, we are in danger every hour?
46.15:31.w1-w3^every day i die,
46.15:31.w4-w16^as surely as the in you boasting, brothers which i have in christ jesus the lord of us.
46.15:31.w9-w16^which i have in christ jesus the lord of us.
46.15:32.w1-w6^if according to man, i fought wild beasts in ephesus,
46.15:32.w7-w10^what to me the profit?
46.15:32.w11-w14^if [the] dead not are raised,
46.15:32.w15_2^let us eat
46.15:32.w16-w17^and let us drink,
46.15:32.w18-w20^tomorrow for we die.”
46.15:33.w1-w2^not be misled:
46.15:33.w3-w7^do corrupt morals good, companionships bad.”
46.15:34.w1-w2^sober up righteously
46.15:34.w3-w5^and not sin;
46.15:34.w6-w10^ignorance for of god some have;
46.15:34.w6^ignorance
46.15:34.w11-w14^to [the] shame of you i speak.
46.15:35.w1-w3^but will say someone,
46.15:35.w4-w7^how are raised the dead?
46.15:35.w8-w11^with what then body do they come?
46.15:35.w8^with what
46.15:36.w1-w6^fool you! what you sow not does come to life,
46.15:36.w2-w4^you! what you sow
46.15:36.w7-w9^if not it dies.
46.15:37.w1-w3^and what you sow,
46.15:37.w2-w3^what you sow,
46.15:37.w4-w9^not the body that will be you sow,
46.15:37.w7-w8_2^that will be
46.15:37.w10-w19^but a bare grain, if it may be of wheat, or of some of the rest.
46.15:37.w13-w14^if it may be
46.15:38.w1-w6^- but god gives it a body,
46.15:38.w1^-
46.15:38.w7-w8^as he has willed,
46.15:38.w9-w14^and to each of the seeds, its own body.
46.15:39.w1-w6^not all flesh [is] the same flesh,
46.15:39.w7-w10^but one indeed of men,
46.15:39.w11-w14^another now flesh of beasts,
46.15:39.w15-w18^another now flesh of birds,
46.15:39.w19-w21^another now of fish.
46.15:4.w1-w3^and that he was buried,
46.15:4.w4-w13^and that he was raised the day the third according to the scriptures,
46.15:40.w1-w6^and bodies [there are] heavenly, and bodies earthly.
46.15:40.w7-w13^but one truly [is] the of the heavenly glory,
46.15:40.w14-w18^another now that of the earthly.
46.15:41.w1-w3^one [is] [the] glory of [the] sun,
46.15:41.w4-w7^and another [the] glory of [the] moon,
46.15:41.w8-w11^and another [the] glory of [the] stars;
46.15:41.w12-w17^star for from star differs in glory.
46.15:42.w1-w6^so also [is] the resurrection of the dead.
46.15:42.w7-w9^it is sown in decay,
46.15:42.w10-w12^it is raised in immortality.
46.15:43.w1-w3^it is sown in dishonor,
46.15:43.w4-w6^it is raised in glory.
46.15:43.w7-w9^it is sown in weakness,
46.15:43.w10-w12^it is raised in power.
46.15:44.w1-w3^it is sown a body natural,
46.15:44.w4-w6^it is raised a body spiritual.
46.15:44.w7-w10^if there is a body natural,
46.15:44.w11-w13^there is also spiritual.
46.15:45.w1-w3^so also it has been written:
46.15:45.w4-w11^became the first man adam into a soul living;
46.15:45.w11_2^living;
46.15:45.w12-w17^the last adam into a spirit life-giving.”
46.15:45.w17_2^life-giving.”
46.15:46.w1-w5^however not first [was] the spiritual,
46.15:46.w6-w8^but the natural,
46.15:46.w9-w11^then the spiritual.
46.15:47.w1-w6^the first man [was] from [the] earth, made of dust;
46.15:47.w7-w11^the second man from heaven.
46.15:48.w1-w3^as the [one] made of dust,
46.15:48.w4-w7^so also [are] those of the earth;
46.15:48.w8-w11^and as the heavenly [one],
46.15:48.w12-w15^so also those of heaven.
46.15:49.w1-w7^and as we have born the image of the earthly,
46.15:49.w8-w13^we shall bear also the image of the heavenly.
46.15:5.w1-w4^and that he appeared to cephas,
46.15:5.w5-w7^then to the twelve.
46.15:50.w1-w4^this now i say, brothers,
46.15:50.w5-w13^that flesh and blood, [the] kingdom of god to inherit not is able,
46.15:50.w9-w11^[the] kingdom of god to inherit
46.15:50.w14-w19^nor the decay, the immortality does inherit.
46.15:51.w1_2^behold,
46.15:51.w2-w4^a mystery to you i tell.
46.15:51.w5-w7^all not we will sleep;
46.15:51.w8-52.w9^all however we will be changed — in an instant, in [the] twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet.
46.15:52.w10-w11^the trumpet will sound for,
46.15:52.w12-w16^and the dead will be raised imperishable,
46.15:52.w17-w19^and we will be changed.
46.15:53.w1-w13^it behooves for the perishable this, to put on imperishable; and the mortal this, to put on immortality.
46.15:53.w3-w7^the perishable this, to put on imperishable;
46.15:53.w8-w13^and the mortal this, to put on immortality.
46.15:54.w1-w7^when now the perishable this shall have put on [the] imperishable,
46.15:54.w8-w13^and the mortal this shall have put on immortality,
46.15:54.w14-w19^then will come to pass the word - having been written:
46.15:54.w18-w19_2^- having been written:
46.15:54.w20-w24^has been swallowed up - death in victory.”
46.15:55.w1-w5^where of you, o death, the victory?
46.15:55.w2_2^of you,
46.15:55.w6-w10^where of you, o death, the sting?”
46.15:55.w7_2^of you,
46.15:56.w1-w7^- and the sting - of death [is] - sin;
46.15:56.w1^-
46.15:56.w8-w14^- and the power - of sin, the law;
46.15:56.w8^-
46.15:57.w1-w15^to however god [be] thanks, the [one] giving us the victory through the lord of us jesus christ.
46.15:57.w1^to
46.15:57.w5-w15^the [one] giving us the victory through the lord of us jesus christ.
46.15:58.w1-w24^therefore, brothers of me beloved, steadfast be, immovable, abounding in the work of the lord always, knowing that the toil of you not is in vain in [the] lord.

46.15:58.w16-w24^that the toil of you not is in vain in [the] lord.
46.15:6.w1-w6^thereafter he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once,
46.15:6.w7-w13^of whom the greater part remain until now;
46.15:6.w14-w16^some however have fallen asleep.
46.15:7.w1-w3^then he appeared to james,
46.15:7.w4-w7^then to the apostles all.
46.15:8.w1-w8^last then of all, as the untimely birth, he appeared also to me.

46.2:12.w1-w8^we now, not the spirit of the world have received,

46.2:12.w18-w23^the things by - god having been granted to us,
46.2:12.w18^the things
46.2:13.w1-w9^which also we speak, not in taught of human wisdom words,
46.2:13.w10-w16^but in [those] taught of [the] spirit, by spiritual [means] spiritual things communicating.
46.2:13.w14-w16^by spiritual [means] spiritual things communicating.

46.2:14.w18_2^to understand [them],
46.2:14.w19-w21^because spiritually they are discerned.
46.2:15.w1-w6^he who [is] however spiritual judges - all things
46.2:15.w1^he who [is]
46.2:15.w7-w11^he himself, however by no one is judged.
46.2:16.w1-w5^who for has known [the] mind of [the] lord?
46.2:16.w6-w8^who will instruct him?”
46.2:16.w9-w13^we however [the] mind of christ have.
46.2:2.w1-w7^nothing for i decided anything to know among you,
46.2:2.w4-w7^anything to know among you,
46.2:2.w8-w14^if not jesus christ, and him having been crucified.
46.2:2.w14_2^having been crucified.
46.2:3.w1-w13^and i, in weakness, and in fear, and in trembling much, was with you.
46.2:4.w1-w13^and the message of me and the preaching of me [were] not in persuasive of wisdom words,
46.2:4.w14-w19^but in demonstration of [the] spirit and of power,
46.2:5.w1-w9^so that the faith of you not might be in wisdom of men,
46.2:5.w10-w13^but in power of god.
46.2:6.w1-w6^wisdom however we speak among the mature;
46.2:6.w7-w20^wisdom however, not the age of this, nor of the rulers the age of this, who are coming to naught.
46.2:6.w7^wisdom
46.2:6.w19-w20_2^who are coming to naught.
46.2:7.w1-w8^but we speak of god wisdom in a mystery, - having been hidden,
46.2:7.w7-w8_2^- having been hidden,
46.2:7.w9-w18^which foreordained - god before the ages for glory of us,

46.2:9.w8-w11^and ear not has heard,
46.2:9.w12-w17^and into heart of man not has entered,

46.2:9.w22-w24^for those loving him.”
46.3:1.w1-w8^and i brothers not was able to speak to you as to spiritual,
46.3:1.w5-w8^to speak to you as to spiritual,
46.3:1.w9-w15^but as to fleshly, as to infants in christ.
46.3:10.w1-w13^according to the grace - of god - having been given to me, as a wise master builder [the] foundation i have laid;

46.3:10.w14-w16^another however is building upon [it].
46.3:10.w17-w21^each one however let take heed how he builds upon [it].
46.3:10.w20-w21^how he builds upon [it].
46.3:11.w1-w3^foundation for another,
46.3:11.w1^foundation
46.3:11.w7-w9_2^besides the [one] being already laid,
46.3:11.w10-w13^which is jesus christ.
46.3:12.w1-w14^if now anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, stones precious, wood, hay, straw,
46.3:13.w1-w5^of each the work manifest will become;
46.3:13.w6-w9^the for day will disclose [it],
46.3:13.w6^the
46.3:13.w10-w13^because in fire it is revealed;
46.3:13.w14-w19^and of each the work, what sort it is,
46.3:13.w20-w23^the fire itself will prove.
46.3:14.w1-w5^if of anyone the work will remain
46.3:14.w6-w7^which he built up,
46.3:14.w8-w9^a reward he will receive.
46.3:15.w1-w5^if of anyone the work will be burned up,
46.3:15.w6_2^he will suffer loss;
46.3:15.w7-w9^he himself however will be saved,
46.3:15.w10-w14^so however as through fire.
46.3:16.w1-w2^not know you
46.3:16.w3-w6^that temple of god you yourselves are,
46.3:16.w7-w14^and the spirit - of god dwells? in you
46.3:17.w1-w7^if anyone the temple - of god destroys,
46.3:17.w8-w11^will destroy him - god;
46.3:17.w12-w18^- for the temple - of god holy is,
46.3:17.w12^-
46.3:17.w19-w21^which are you.
46.3:18.w1-w3^no one himself let deceive;
46.3:18.w4-w14^if anyone thinks [himself] wise to be among you in the age this,
46.3:18.w7-w14^wise to be among you in the age this,
46.3:18.w15-w16^foolish let him become,
46.3:18.w17-w19^so that he may become wise.
46.3:19.w1-w11^the for wisdom of the world this, foolishness with - god is.
46.3:19.w1^the
46.3:19.w12-w13^it has been written for:
46.3:19.w14-w21^[he is] the [one] catching the wise in the craftiness of them.”
46.3:2.w1-w3^milk you i gave to drink,
46.3:2.w4-w5^not solid food,
46.3:2.w6-w8^not yet for were you able.
46.3:2.w9-w13^in fact, not still now are you able;
46.3:20.w1-w2^and again,
46.3:20.w3-w8^[the] lord knows the thoughts of the wise,
46.3:20.w9-w11^that they are futile.”
46.3:21.w1-w5^therefore no one let boast in men.
46.3:21.w6-22.w16^all things for of you are, whether paul, or apollos, or cephas, or [the] world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come—
46.3:21.w6^all things
46.3:22.w13-w14^or things present,
46.3:22.w15-w16^or things to come—
46.3:22.w17-w18^all yours,
46.3:23.w1-w3^you now of christ,
46.3:23.w4-w6^christ now of god.
46.3:3.w1-w4^still for fleshly you are.
46.3:3.w5-w11^where for [are] among you jealousy and strife,
46.3:3.w12-w14^not fleshly are you,
46.3:3.w15-w18^and according to man are walking?
46.3:4.w1-w4^when for might say one,
46.3:4.w5-w8^i indeed am of paul,
46.3:4.w9-w10^another however,
46.3:4.w11-w12^i of apollos,
46.3:4.w13-w15^not fleshly are you?
46.3:5.w1-w4^who then is apollos?
46.3:5.w5-w8^who now is paul?
46.3:5.w9_2^servants
46.3:5.w10-w12^through whom you believed,
46.3:5.w13-w18^also to each as the lord has given?
46.3:6.w1-w2^i planted,
46.3:6.w3-w4^apollos watered,
46.3:6.w5-w8^but - god kept [it] growing.
46.3:7.w1-w9^so neither the [one] planting is anything, nor the [one] watering,
46.3:7.w3-w4_2^the [one] planting
46.3:7.w7-w9^nor the [one] watering,
46.3:7.w10-w13^but [only] the [one] giving growth — god.
46.3:7.w12_2^giving growth —
46.3:8.w1-w2_2^the [one] planting
46.3:8.w4-w6^and the [one] watering,
46.3:8.w9-w18^each now the own reward will receive, according to the own labor.
46.3:9.w1-w4^of god for we are fellow workers;
46.3:9.w1^of god
46.3:9.w5-w9^god’s field, god’s building you are.
46.4:1.w1-w11^so us, let regard a man as servants of christ and stewards of the mysteries of god.
46.4:10.w1-w4^we [are] fools on account of christ,
46.4:10.w5-w9^you however wise in christ;
46.4:10.w10-w11^we weak,
46.4:10.w12-w14^you however strong;
46.4:10.w15-w16^you honored,
46.4:10.w17-11.w4^we however without honor. as far as the present hour,
46.4:11.w5-w6^both we hunger
46.4:11.w7-w8^and thirst,
46.4:11.w9-w10^and are poorly clad,
46.4:11.w11-w12^and are buffeted,
46.4:11.w13-w14^and wander homeless,
46.4:12.w1-w6^and we toil, working with [our] own hands.
46.4:12.w3-w6^working with [our] own hands.
46.4:12.w7_2^being reviled,
46.4:12.w9_2^being persecuted,
46.4:13.w1_2^being slandered,
46.4:13.w3-w11^as [the] scum of the earth we have become, of all [the] refuse, until now.
46.4:14.w1-w11^not shaming you do i write these things, but as children my beloved, admonishing [you].
46.4:14.w2-w3^shaming you
46.4:14.w6-w11^but as children my beloved, admonishing [you].
46.4:15.w1-w7^if for ten thousand guardians you should have in christ,
46.4:15.w8-w11^yet not many fathers;
46.4:15.w12-w21^in for christ jesus, through the gospel, i you have begotten.
46.4:15.w12^in
46.4:16.w1-w3^i exhort therefore you,
46.4:16.w4-w6^imitators of me become.
46.4:17.w1-w5^on account of this i sent to you timothy,
46.4:17.w6-w14^who is my child, beloved and faithful in [the] lord,
46.4:17.w15-w24^who you will remind of the ways of me that [are] in christ jesus,
46.4:17.w25-w30^as everywhere in every church i teach.
46.4:18.w1-w7^as to not coming now of me to you,
46.4:18.w1^as to
46.4:18.w8-w9^have become puffed up some.
46.4:19.w1-w5^i will come however shortly to you,
46.4:19.w6-w9^if the lord wills,
46.4:19.w10-w16^and i will find out not the talk of those being puffed up,
46.4:19.w15-w16_2^of those being puffed up,
46.4:19.w17-w19^but the power.
46.4:2.w1-w6^in this case moreover, it is required in the stewards,
46.4:2.w7-w10^that faithful one shall be found.
46.4:20.w1-w8^not for in word the kingdom - of god [is],
46.4:20.w1_2^not
46.4:20.w9-w11^but in power.
46.4:21.w1-w2^what desire you?
46.4:21.w3-w7^with a rod i should come to you,
46.4:21.w8-w13^or in love, a spirit then of gentleness?
46.4:3.w1-w5^me however to the smallest matter it is,
46.4:3.w6-w13^that by you i be examined, or by a human court.
46.4:3.w7-w8_2^by you
46.4:3.w14-w17^in fact neither myself do i examine.
46.4:4.w1-w4^nothing for against myself i am conscious of,
46.4:4.w5-w9^yet not by this have i been justified;
46.4:4.w10-w13^the [one] however judging me
46.4:4.w10^the [one]
46.4:5.w1-w6^so then, not before [the] time anything judge,
46.4:5.w7-w11^until - shall have come the lord,
46.4:5.w12-w18^who both will bring to light the hidden things - of darkness,
46.4:5.w19-w24^and will make manifest the motives of the hearts;
46.4:5.w25-w33^and then the praise will come to each from - god.
46.4:6.w1-w10^these things now, brothers, i have applied to myself and apollos on account of you,
46.4:6.w11-w19^so that in us you may learn -, not beyond what has been written,
46.4:6.w15-w19^-, not beyond what has been written,
46.4:6.w17-w19^beyond what has been written,
46.4:6.w20-w29^that not one for - one you be puffed up over the other.
46.4:7.w1-w4^who for you makes different?
46.4:7.w5-w7^what now have you
46.4:7.w8-w10^which not you did receive?
46.4:7.w11-w14^if now also you did receive [it],
46.4:7.w15-w19^why boast you as not having received [it]?
46.4:7.w17-w19^as not having received [it]?
46.4:7.w17^as
46.4:8.w1-w2^already satiated
46.4:8.w4-w5^already you have been enriched;
46.4:8.w6-w8^apart from us you reigned,
46.4:8.w9-w12^and i wish that really you did reign,
46.4:8.w13-w17^so that also we you might reign with.
46.4:9.w1-w2^i think for,
46.4:9.w3-w11^- god us - apostles last has exhibited, as appointed to death,
46.4:9.w12-w20^because a spectacle we have become to the world, both to angels and to men.
46.5:1.w1-w5^actually is reported among you sexual immorality,
46.5:1.w6-w13^and such sexual immorality as not even among the pagans,
46.5:1.w9-w13^as not even among the pagans,
46.5:1.w14-w19^so as for [the] wife one of the father to have.
46.5:1.w15^[the] wife
46.5:10.w1-w14^not altogether with the sexually immoral the world of this, or with the covetous and swindlers, or idolaters —
46.5:10.w15-w21^since you would need then from the world to depart.
46.5:10.w18-w21^from the world to depart.
46.5:11.w1-w6^now however, i wrote to you not to associate with [him]
46.5:11.w5-w6^not to associate with [him]
46.5:11.w7-w22^if anyone a brother being designated, he is sexually immoral or a coveter, or an idolater or verbal abuser, or a drunkard, or swindler —
46.5:11.w10_2^being designated,
46.5:11.w23-w26^with such a one not even to eat.
46.5:12.w1-w6^what for [is it] to me those outside to judge?
46.5:12.w4-w6^those outside to judge?
46.5:12.w7-w11^not those within you do judge?
46.5:13.w1-w6^those however outside - god will judge.
46.5:13.w1^those
46.5:13.w7-w12^expel the evil out from yourselves that.”
46.5:2.w1-w4^and you puffed up are,
46.5:2.w3_2^puffed up
46.5:2.w5-w8^and not rather have mourned,
46.5:2.w9-w18^so that might be taken out of midst of you the [one] the deed this having done!
46.5:2.w14-w18^the [one] the deed this having done!
46.5:2.w14^the [one]
46.5:3.w1-w18^i indeed, though being absent - in body, being present now - in spirit, already have judged as being present the [one] so this having produced,
46.5:3.w2_2^indeed,
46.5:3.w4-w6^being absent - in body,
46.5:3.w7-w10^being present now - in spirit,
46.5:3.w13-w14_2^as being present
46.5:3.w15-w18^the [one] so this having produced,
46.5:3.w15^the [one]
46.5:4.w1-w20^in the name of the lord our jesus having been gathered together you, and - of me in spirit, with the power of the lord of us jesus,
46.5:5.w1-w9^to deliver - such a one - to satan for destruction of the flesh,
46.5:5.w10-w18^so that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord.
46.5:6.w1-w5^not good [is] the boasting of you.
46.5:6.w6-w7^not know you
46.5:6.w8-w14^that a little leaven all the lump leavens?
46.5:7.w1-w4^cleanse out the old leaven,
46.5:7.w5-w8^that you may be a new lump,
46.5:7.w9-w11^as you are, unleavened.
46.5:7.w12-w18^also for the passover lamb of us has been sacrificed, christ,
46.5:7.w14-w16^the passover lamb of us
46.5:8.w1-w6^so that we might celebrate the feast, not with leaven old,
46.5:8.w7-w12^not with leaven of malice and wickedness,
46.5:8.w13-w18^but with unleavened [bread] of sincerity and of truth.
46.5:9.w1-w8^i wrote to you in the letter not to associate with the sexually immoral,
46.5:9.w6-w8^not to associate with the sexually immoral,

46.6:4.w12-w13^those set you up!
46.6:5.w1-w5^for shame to you i say this. thus
46.6:5.w6-w11^not is there among you no one, a wise [man],
46.6:5.w12-w19^who will be able to decide in between the brother of him?
46.6:5.w14-w19^to decide in between the brother of him?
46.6:6.w1-w5^instead, brother against brother goes to law,
46.6:6.w6-w9^and this before unbelievers!
46.6:7.w1-w7^already indeed therefore altogether a defeat for you it is,
46.6:7.w8-w12^that lawsuits you have among one another.
46.6:7.w13-w17^because of why not rather suffer wrong?
46.6:7.w18-w22^because of why not rather be defrauded?
46.6:8.w1-w3^but you do wrong
46.6:8.w4-w5^and defraud,
46.6:8.w6-w8^and these things to brothers!
46.6:9.w1-w3^or not know you

46.6:9.w10-w11^not be deceived:
46.7:1.w1-w4^concerning now the things about which you wrote:

46.7:14.w1-w9^is sanctified for the husband - unbelieving, in the wife;
46.7:14.w10-w18^and is sanctified the wife - unbelieving, in the husband;
46.7:14.w19-w25^else then the children of you unclean are;
46.7:14.w26-w29^now however holy they are.
46.7:15.w1-w5^if however the unbeliever separates himself,
46.7:15.w6_2^let him separate himself;
46.7:15.w7-w16^not is under bondage the brother or the sister in - such [cases].
46.7:15.w17-w23^into however peace has called you - god.

46.7:18.w6-w9^in uncircumcision was called anyone?

46.7:19.w10-w13^but keeping [the] commandments of god.
46.7:2.w1-w9^because of however - sexual immorality, each man the [own] of him wife let have,
46.7:2.w1^because of
46.7:2.w10-w15^and each [woman] the own husband let have.
46.7:20.w1-w6^each in the calling in which he has been called,
46.7:20.w5-w6^in which he has been called,
46.7:20.w7-w9^in this let him abide.
46.7:21.w1-w2^slave [being] were you called,
46.7:21.w3-w5^not to you let it be a care;

46.7:24.w6-w10^in that let him abide with god.
46.7:25.w1-w8^concerning now the virgins, a commandment of [the] lord not i have;
46.7:25.w1^concerning
46.7:25.w9-w17^judgment however i give, as having received mercy from [the] lord, trustworthy to be.

46.7:28.w14-w20^tribulation however in the flesh will have - such;
46.7:28.w21-w24^i now you am sparing.
46.7:29.w1-w4^this now i say, brothers:
46.7:29.w5-w8^the season shortened is.
46.7:29.w7_2^shortened

46.7:31.w6-w8^as not using [it] as their own.
46.7:31.w6^as
46.7:31.w9-w15^is passing away for the present form of the world this.
46.7:32.w1-w5^i desire now you without concern to be.
46.7:32.w3-w5^you without concern to be.
46.7:32.w6-w11^the unmarried man cares for the things of the lord,
46.7:32.w12-w15^how he should please the lord;
46.7:33.w1-w3^the [one] however having been married,
46.7:33.w1^the [one]
46.7:33.w8-w11^how he should please the wife,
46.7:34.w1-w2^and is divided.
46.7:34.w3-w14^and the woman - unmarried and - virgin, cares for the things of the lord,
46.7:34.w15-w23^that she should be holy both in body and in spirit;
46.7:34.w24-w26^the [one] however having been married,
46.7:34.w24^the [one]
46.7:34.w31-w34^how she should please the husband.
46.7:35.w1-w8^this now for the of you yourselves benefit i say,
46.7:35.w9-w13^not that a restraint you i might place upon,
46.7:35.w14-w22^but for what [is] seemly and devoted to the lord, without distraction.
46.7:36.w1-w9^if however anyone to be behaving improperly to the virgin of him supposes,
46.7:36.w4-w8^to be behaving improperly to the virgin of him
46.7:36.w10-w12^if she is beyond youth,
46.7:36.w13-w16^and so it ought to be,
46.7:36.w14_2^so
46.7:36.w17-w18^what he wills
46.7:36.w20-w21^not he does sin;
46.7:36.w22_2^let them marry.
46.7:37.w1-w11^he who however stands in the heart of him firm, not having necessity,
46.7:37.w9-w11^not having necessity,
46.7:37.w12-w18^authority however having over the own will,
46.7:37.w19-w29^and this has judged, in the own heart, to keep - the virgin,
46.7:37.w26-w29^to keep - the virgin,
46.7:38.w1-w9^so then also, the [one] marrying the own virgin, well does;
46.7:38.w3-w7^the [one] marrying the own virgin,
46.7:38.w10-w15^and the [one] not marrying, better will do.
46.7:38.w11-w13^the [one] not marrying,

46.7:39.w10-w14^if however shall have died the husband,
46.7:39.w15-w19^free she is to whom she wills to be married,
46.7:39.w17-w18^to whom she wills
46.7:39.w20-w22^only in [the] lord.
46.7:4.w1-w7^the wife, the own body not has authority over,
46.7:4.w8-w10^but the husband;
46.7:4.w11-w20^likewise now, also the husband of the own body not has authority over,
46.7:4.w21-w23^but the wife.
46.7:40.w1-w10^more blessed however she is, if in the same manner she should remain, according to - my judgment;
46.7:40.w4-w6^if in the same manner she should remain,
46.7:40.w11-w16^i think now myself also [the] spirit of god to have.
46.7:40.w14-w16^[the] spirit of god to have.
46.7:5.w1-w3^not deprive one another,
46.7:5.w4-w10^if not - by mutual agreement, for a time,
46.7:5.w11-w14^that you might be at leisure - for prayer;
46.7:5.w15-w20^and again, together the same be,
46.7:5.w21-w30^so that not may tempt you - satan, through the lack of self-control of you.
46.7:6.w1-w5^this now i say by way of concession,
46.7:6.w6-w8^not by way of command.
46.7:7.w1-w8^i wish now all men to be like even myself.
46.7:7.w3-w8^all men to be like even myself.
46.7:7.w9-w15^but each his own has gift from god;
46.7:7.w11^his own
46.7:7.w16-w18^one [has] indeed this,
46.7:7.w19-w21^one however that.
46.7:8.w1-w7^i say now to the unmarried and to the widows,
46.7:8.w8-w9^[it is] good for them
46.7:8.w10-w13^if they should remain as even i.
46.7:9.w1-w4^if however not they have self-control,
46.7:9.w5_2^let them marry;
46.7:9.w6-w9^better for it is to marry
46.7:9.w9_2^to marry
46.7:9.w10-w11^than to burn with passion.
46.7:9.w11_2^to burn with passion.
46.8:1.w1-w5^concerning now the things sacrificed to idols, we know
46.8:1.w1^concerning
46.8:1.w6-w9^indeed all knowledge we have.
46.8:1.w10-w12^- knowledge puffs up,
46.8:1.w13-w16^- but love builds up.
46.8:1.w13^-
46.8:10.w1-w11^if for anyone sees you, - having knowledge, in an idol’s temple eating,
46.8:10.w6-w8^- having knowledge,
46.8:10.w9-w11^in an idol’s temple eating,
46.8:10.w12-w23^not the conscience of him weak being, will be built up, so as the things sacrificed to idols to eat?
46.8:10.w15-w17^of him weak being,
46.8:10.w19-w23^so as the things sacrificed to idols to eat?
46.8:10.w19-w20^so as the
46.8:11.w1-w14^is destroyed for the [one] being weak through - your knowledge, the brother for whom christ died.
46.8:11.w3-w4_2^the [one] being weak
46.8:11.w11-w14^for whom christ died.
46.8:12.w1-w6^thus then sinning against the brothers
46.8:12.w7-w12^and wounding their - conscience being weak,
46.8:12.w12_2^being weak,
46.8:13.w1-w7^therefore if food snares the brother of me,
46.8:13.w8-w14^never not shall i eat meat to the age,
46.8:13.w15-w20^so that not the brother of me i might snare.
46.8:2.w1-w5^if anyone thinks to have known anything,
46.8:2.w4-w5^to have known anything,
46.8:2.w6-w7^not yet does he know
46.8:2.w8-w10^as it is necessary to know.
46.8:2.w10_2^to know.
46.8:3.w1-w6^if however anyone loves - god,
46.8:3.w7-w10^he is known by him.
46.8:4.w1-w7^concerning the eating therefore of the things sacrificed to idols, we know
46.8:4.w1-w3^concerning the eating
46.8:4.w8-w12^that nothing an idol [is] in [the] world,
46.8:4.w13-w16^and that [there is] no god,
46.8:4.w17-w19^if not one.
46.8:5.w1-w12^even truly if indeed there are [those] called gods, whether in heaven or on earth,
46.8:5.w5_2^[those] called
46.8:5.w13-w19^as there are gods many, and lords many,
46.8:6.w1-w6^yet to us [there is] one god, the father,
46.8:6.w7-w10^of whom [are] the things all,
46.8:6.w11-w14^and we for him;
46.8:6.w15-w19^and one lord, jesus christ,
46.8:6.w20-w23^by whom [are] the things all,
46.8:6.w24-w27^and we through him.
46.8:7.w1-w6^but not in all [is] this knowledge.
46.8:7.w7-w14^some now, - by habit until now, of the idol
46.8:7.w9-w10^- by habit
46.8:7.w15-w17^as of a thing sacrificed to an idol eat;
46.8:7.w18-w24^and the conscience of them weak being, it is defiled.
46.8:7.w22-w23^weak being,
46.8:8.w1-w7^food however us not will commend to god;
46.8:8.w8-w11^neither if not we should eat
46.8:8.w12_2^do we come short,
46.8:8.w13-w15^nor if we should eat
46.8:8.w16_2^have we an advantage.
46.8:9.w1-w2^be careful however,
46.8:9.w3-w12^lest somehow the right of you this an occasion of stumbling becomes to those being weak.
46.9:1.w1-w3^not am i free?
46.9:1.w4-w6^not am i an apostle?
46.9:1.w7-w12^not jesus the lord of us have i seen?
46.9:1.w13-w20^not the work of me, you are, in [the] lord.
46.9:10.w1-w5^or because of us entirely is he speaking?
46.9:10.w6-w9^for sake of us for it was written,
46.9:10.w10-w16^because ought in hope the [one] plowing to plow,
46.9:10.w12-w13_2^in hope
46.9:10.w14-w15_2^the [one] plowing
46.9:10.w17-w23^and the [one] threshing, in hope - to partake.

46.9:10.w20-w23_2^in hope - to partake.
46.9:10.w22-w23_2^- to partake.
46.9:11.w1-w6^if we among you - spiritual things have sown,
46.9:11.w7_2^[is it] a great thing
46.9:11.w8-w13^if we, from you - material things will reap?
46.9:12.w1-w6^if others of the over you authority partake,
46.9:12.w7-w9^[should] not more we?
46.9:12.w10-w15^but not we did use the right this.
46.9:12.w16-w18^instead, all things we bear,
46.9:12.w19-w27^so that not any hindrance we should place to the gospel of christ.
46.9:13.w1-w2^not know you
46.9:13.w3-w12^that those in the temple working, the things of the temple eat;
46.9:13.w4-w7^those in the temple working,
46.9:13.w4^those
46.9:13.w13-w16^those at the altar attending,

46.9:14.w1-w13^so also, the lord has prescribed to those the gospel proclaiming from the gospel to live.
46.9:14.w6-w9^to those the gospel proclaiming
46.9:14.w6^to those
46.9:14.w10-w13^from the gospel to live.
46.9:15.w1-w6^i however not have used none of these.
46.9:15.w7-w10^neither have i written now, these things
46.9:15.w11-w15^that thus it should be with me;
46.9:15.w16-w20^[it were] good for me rather to die,
46.9:15.w20_2^to die,
46.9:15.w21-w26^than the boasting of me, anyone will make void.

46.9:16.w4-w7^nothing there is to me boasting;
46.9:16.w8-w11^necessity for me is laid upon.

46.9:17.w1-w5^if for willingly this i do,
46.9:17.w6-w7^a reward i have;
46.9:17.w8-w10^if however unwillingly,
46.9:17.w11-w12^a stewardship i am entrusted with.
46.9:18.w1-w6^what then of me is the reward?
46.9:18.w3^of me
46.9:18.w7-w22^that in preaching the gospel free of charge, i should offer the gospel, so as - not to use up the right of me in the gospel.
46.9:18.w8_2^in preaching the gospel
46.9:18.w13-w22^so as - not to use up the right of me in the gospel.
46.9:18.w13-w14^so as -
46.9:19.w1-w5^free for being from all,
46.9:19.w9-w12^so that the more i might gain.
46.9:2.w1-w5^if to others not i am an apostle,

47.11:26.w1-w2^in journeyings often,
47.11:26.w3-w24_2^in perils of rivers, in perils of robbers; in perils from [my own] race, in perils from [the] gentiles; in perils in [the] city, in perils in [the] wilderness; in perils on [the] sea, in perils among false brothers;

47.11:3.w1-w2^i am afraid however,
47.11:3.w3-w13^lest by any means as the serpent deceived eve in the craftiness of him,
47.11:3.w14-w27^might be corrupted the minds of you from the simplicity and the purity - in - christ.
47.11:30.w1-w3^if to boast it behooves [me],
47.11:30.w2_2^to boast

47.11:33.w1-w9^but through a window in a basket i was let down through the wall,
47.11:33.w10-w14^and i escaped the hands of him.

47.12:1.w6-w12^i will go on however to visions and revelations of [the] lord.

47.12:19.w11^-
47.12:2.w1-w7^i know a man in christ, ago years fourteen —

47.12:2.w19-w21^- god knows —
47.12:2.w22_2^having been caught up
47.12:20.w1-w2^i fear for
47.12:20.w3-w10^lest perhaps, having come, not such as i wish i may find you,
47.12:20.w5_2^having come,
47.12:20.w6-w8^not such as i wish
47.12:20.w6-w8_2^not such as i wish
47.12:20.w11-w16^and i might be found by you such as not you do wish;
47.12:20.w14-w16^such as not you do wish;
47.12:20.w17-w26^lest perhaps quarreling, jealousy, anger, contentions, slander, gossip, conceit, disorder;
47.12:21.w1-w11^lest again having come of me, should humble me the god of me as to you,
47.12:21.w2-w4^again having come of me,
47.12:21.w12-w28^and i should mourn over many of those having before sinned and not having repented of the impurity and sexual immorality and sensuality that they have practiced.
47.12:21.w15-w16_2^of those having before sinned
47.12:21.w17-w26^and not having repented of the impurity and sexual immorality and sensuality
47.12:21.w27-w28^that they have practiced.
47.12:3.w1-w5^and i know - such a man —
47.12:3.w6-w8^whether in [the] body
47.12:3.w9-w12^or out of the body,
47.12:3.w13-w14^not i know,
47.12:3.w15-w17^- god knows —
47.12:4.w1-w5^that he was caught up into - paradise,
47.12:4.w6-w9^and he heard inexpressible words,
47.12:4.w10_2^-
47.12:5.w1-w4^concerning - such a man i will boast;
47.12:5.w5-w9^concerning however myself, not i will boast,
47.12:5.w5^concerning
47.12:5.w10-w14^if not in the weaknesses.
47.12:6.w1-w4^if for i should desire to boast,
47.12:6.w4_2^to boast,
47.12:6.w5-w7^not i will be a fool;
47.12:6.w8-w10^[the] truth for i will be speaking.
47.12:6.w11-w12^i refrain however,
47.12:6.w13-w26^lest anyone to me should credit more than what he sees in me, or hears anyone of me,
47.12:6.w18-w21^more than what he sees in me,
47.12:6.w22-w26^or hears anyone of me,
47.12:7.w1-w5^and the surpassingness of the revelations.
47.12:7.w6-w9^therefore that not i should become conceited,
47.12:7.w10-w16^was given to me a thorn in [my] flesh, a messenger of satan,
47.12:7.w17-w19^that me he might buffet,
47.12:7.w20-w22^so that not i should become conceited.
47.12:8.w1-w6^for this, three times the lord i begged,
47.12:8.w7-w10^that it might depart from me.
47.12:9.w1-w3^and he said to me,
47.12:9.w4-w8^suffices you the grace of me;
47.12:9.w9-w14^the for power in weakness is perfected.
47.12:9.w9^the
47.12:9.w15-w22^most gladly therefore rather will i boast in the weaknesses of me,
47.12:9.w23-w30^so that may rest upon me the power - of christ.
47.13:1.w1-w5^third this [time] i am coming to you.
47.13:1.w6-w14^in [the] mouth of two witnesses or three, will be established every matter.”
47.13:10.w1-w5^because of therefore these things, being absent i write,
47.13:10.w4_2^being absent
47.13:10.w6-w24^so that being present, not with severity i should treat [you], according to the authority that the lord has given me, for building up and not for tearing down.
47.13:10.w7_2^being present,
47.13:10.w14-w24^that the lord has given me, for building up and not for tearing down.
47.13:11.w1-w3^finally, brothers, rejoice!
47.13:11.w4_2^be perfected,
47.13:11.w5_2^be exhorted,
47.13:11.w6-w8^[be of] the same mind,
47.13:11.w9_2^be at peace.
47.13:11.w10-w19^and the god - of love and peace will be with you.
47.13:12.w1-w5^greet one another with a holy kiss.
47.13:12.w6-w10^greet you, the saints all.
47.13:13.w1-w20^the grace of the lord jesus christ, and the love of god, and the fellowship of the holy spirit, [be] with all of you.
47.13:2.w1_2^i have warned
47.13:2.w2-w16^and i warn, as being present the second time, and being absent now those having sinned before, and the rest all,
47.13:2.w4-w7^as being present the second time,
47.13:2.w8-w10^and being absent now
47.13:2.w11-w12_2^those having sinned before,
47.13:2.w17-w22^that if i come to the [same] again,
47.13:2.w23-w24^not i will spare [anyone],
47.13:3.w1-w8^since a proof you seek, - in me speaking of christ,
47.13:3.w2_2^a proof
47.13:3.w5-w7^in me speaking
47.13:3.w9-w13^who toward you not is weak,
47.13:3.w14-w17^but is powerful among you.
47.13:4.w1-w5^and for he was crucified in weakness,
47.13:4.w6-w10^yet he lives by power god’s.
47.13:4.w11-w16^also for we are weak in him,
47.13:4.w17-w25^but we will live with him by power god’s toward you.
47.13:5.w1-w2^yourselves examine
47.13:5.w3-w7^whether you are in the faith;
47.13:5.w8-w9^yourselves test.
47.13:5.w10-w13^or not do you recognize yourselves
47.13:5.w14-w18^that jesus christ [is] in you,
47.13:5.w19-w22^if not unapproved you are?
47.13:6.w1-w2^i hope now
47.13:6.w3-w4^that you will know
47.13:6.w5-w9^that we not are unapproved.
47.13:7.w1-w10^we pray now to - god, not to do you wrong nothing,
47.13:7.w6-w10^not to do you wrong nothing,
47.13:7.w11-w15^not that we approved might appear,
47.13:7.w16-w21^but that you what [is] right may do;
47.13:7.w22-w26^we though as unapproved might appear.
47.13:8.w1-w7^nothing for have we power any against the truth,
47.13:8.w4-w7^any against the truth,
47.13:8.w8-w11^but for the truth.
47.13:9.w1-w2^we rejoice for
47.13:9.w3-w5^when we might be weak,
47.13:9.w6-w9^you however strong might be.
47.13:9.w10-w15^but this also: we pray for the of you perfection.
47.13:9.w10^but this
47.2:1.w1-w12^i judged for within myself this, - not again in grief to you to come.
47.2:1.w5-w12^- not again in grief to you to come.
47.2:1.w5^-
47.2:10.w1-w4^to whomever now anything you forgive,
47.2:10.w5_2^i also ;
47.2:10.w6-w10^and for i, to whom i have forgiven,
47.2:10.w11-w13^if anything i have forgiven,
47.2:10.w14-w18^[it is] for the sake of you in [the] person of christ,
47.2:11.w1-w6^so that not we should be outwitted by - satan;
47.2:11.w7-w12^not for of his - schemes we are ignorant.
47.2:12.w1-w10^having come now to - troas for the gospel - of christ,
47.2:12.w11-w16^also a door to me having been opened in [the] lord,
47.2:13.w7-w14^in the not finding my titus the brother of me;
47.2:13.w7^in the
47.2:13.w15-w20^instead, having taken leave of them, i went out to macedonia.
47.2:13.w16-w17^having taken leave of them,
47.2:14.w1-w23^to however god [be] thanks, the [one] always leading in triumph us in - christ, and the fragrance of the knowledge of him making manifest through us in every place.
47.2:14.w1^to
47.2:14.w5-w11^the [one] always leading in triumph us in - christ,
47.2:14.w5^the [one]
47.2:14.w12-w23^and the fragrance of the knowledge of him making manifest through us in every place.
47.2:15.w1-w13^for of christ a sweet perfume we are - to god in those being saved and in those perishing;
47.2:15.w7-w9_2^in those being saved
47.2:15.w10-w13^and in those perishing;
47.2:16.w1-w7^to one indeed an odor from death to death,
47.2:16.w8-w14^to one now, a fragrance from life to life.
47.2:16.w15-w19^and for these things who [is] sufficient?
47.2:17.w1-w11^not for we are, like the many, peddling the word - of god;
47.2:17.w7-w11^peddling the word - of god;
47.2:17.w12-w24^but as of sincerity, but as of god, before god in christ we speak.
47.2:2.w1-w5^if for i grieve you
47.2:2.w6-w10^again, who - is gladdening me,
47.2:2.w8-w10^- is gladdening me,
47.2:2.w11-w16^if not the [one] being grieved by me?
47.2:2.w13-w16^the [one] being grieved by me?
47.2:3.w1-w4^and i wrote this same thing,
47.2:3.w5-w18^so that not, having come, grief i might have from [those] of whom it behooves me to rejoice, trusting in all you,
47.2:3.w7_2^having come,
47.2:3.w10-w14^from [those] of whom it behooves me to rejoice,
47.2:3.w13-w14^me to rejoice,
47.2:3.w15-w18^trusting in all you,
47.2:3.w19-w25^that - my joy of all of you is.
47.2:4.w1-w12^out of for much affliction and anguish of heart i wrote to you through many tears,
47.2:4.w1_2^out of
47.2:4.w13-w15^not that you might be grieved,
47.2:4.w16-w20^but the love that you might know
47.2:4.w21-w25^that i have more abundantly toward you.
47.2:5.w1-w4^if however anyone has caused grief,
47.2:5.w5-w7^not me has he grieved,
47.2:5.w8-w15^but in part — that not i might put it too severely — all you.
47.2:5.w11-w13^that not i might put it too severely —
47.2:6.w1-w10^sufficient to such a one [is] the punishment this, which [is] by the majority,
47.2:7.w1-w5^so that on the contrary rather for you to forgive
47.2:7.w6-w7^and to comfort [him],
47.2:7.w8-w15^lest perhaps - by more abundant sorrow should be overwhelmed - such a one.
47.2:8.w1-w7^therefore i exhort you to confirm toward him love.
47.2:8.w4-w7^to confirm toward him love.
47.2:9.w1-w5^for this indeed also did i write,
47.2:9.w6-w10^so that i might know the proof of you,
47.2:9.w11-w15^whether to everything obedient you are.
47.3:1.w1-w4^are we beginning again ourselves to commend?
47.3:1.w2-w4^again ourselves to commend?
47.3:1.w5-w16^or not we need, like some, commendatory letters to you or from you?
47.3:10.w1-w14^even for, not has been glorified that having been made glorious in this - respect, on account of the surpassing [it] glory.
47.3:10.w5-w6_2^that having been made glorious
47.3:10.w13_2^surpassing [it]
47.3:11.w1-w6^if for that which is fading away [was] through glory,
47.3:11.w3-w4_2^that which is fading away
47.3:11.w7-w12^much more [is] that remaining in glory!
47.3:11.w9-w10_2^that remaining
47.3:12.w1-w4^having therefore such hope,
47.3:13.w1-w22^and not as moses would put a veil over the face of himself, for - not to look intently the sons of israel into the end of that fading away.
47.3:13.w11-w22^for - not to look intently the sons of israel into the end of that fading away.
47.3:13.w11-w12^for -
47.3:13.w21-w22_2^of that fading away.
47.3:14.w1-w5^but were hardened the minds of them.
47.3:14.w6-w22^until for the present day, the same veil at the reading of the old covenant remains, not being lifted,
47.3:14.w6^until
47.3:14.w21-w22^not being lifted,
47.3:14.w23-w26^which in christ is being removed.
47.3:15.w1-w7^but unto this day, when - shall be read moses,
47.3:15.w8-w13^a veil over the heart of them lies.
47.3:16.w1-w6^whenever however if [one] shall have turned to [the] lord,
47.3:16.w7-w9^is taken away the veil.
47.3:17.w1-w6^the now lord the spirit is;

47.5:13.w7_2^[it is] for you.
47.5:14.w1-w9^the for love - of christ compels us, having concluded this,
47.5:14.w1^the
47.5:14.w8-w9^having concluded this,
47.5:14.w10-w14^that one for all has died,
47.5:14.w15-w18^therefore - all have died.
47.5:15.w1-w4^and for all he died,
47.5:15.w5-w10^that those living, no longer to themselves should live,
47.5:15.w6-w7_2^those living,
47.5:15.w11-w17^but to the [one] for them having died and having been raised again.

47.5:16.w16-w19^yet now no longer we regard [him thus].

47.5:17.w6-w7_2^[he is] a new creation.
47.5:17.w8-w10^the old things have passed away;
47.5:17.w11_2^behold,
47.5:17.w12-w13^has come into being [the] new.
47.5:18.w1-w19^- and all things [are] of - god, the [one] having reconciled us to himself through christ, and having given to us the ministry - of reconciliation,

47.5:18.w13-w19^and having given to us the ministry - of reconciliation,
47.5:19.w1-w23^how that god was in christ [the] world reconciling to himself, not reckoning to them the trespasses of them, and having put into us the word - of reconciliation.

47.5:19.w16-w23^and having put into us the word - of reconciliation.
47.5:2.w1-w13^and indeed, in this we groan, the dwelling of us which [is] from heaven to be clothed with longing.
47.5:2.w6-w12^the dwelling of us which [is] from heaven to be clothed with
47.5:20.w1-w4^for christ therefore we are ambassadors,

47.5:20.w5^as though
47.5:20.w11-w13^we implore on behalf of christ:
47.5:20.w14-w16^be reconciled - to god.
47.5:21.w1-w4^the [one] not having known sin,
47.5:21.w1^the [one]
47.5:21.w9-w15^so that we might become [the] righteousness of god in him.
47.5:3.w1-w7^if indeed also having been clothed, not naked we will be found.
47.5:3.w4_2^having been clothed,
47.5:4.w1-w9^and for, - being in the tent, we groan, being burdened,
47.5:4.w3-w7^- being in the tent,
47.5:4.w9_2^being burdened,
47.5:4.w10-w14^because that not we do wish to be unclothed
47.5:4.w14_2^to be unclothed
47.5:4.w15-w16^but to be clothed,
47.5:4.w16_2^to be clothed,
47.5:4.w17-w23^that may be swallowed up the mortal by - life.
47.5:5.w1-w7^the [one] now having prepared us for very this
47.5:5.w1^the [one]
47.5:5.w9-w15^- having given to us the pledge of the spirit,
47.5:6.w1-w3^being confident therefore always
47.5:6.w4-w5^and knowing
47.5:6.w6-w14^that, being at home in the body, we are absent from the lord;
47.5:6.w7-w10^being at home in the body,
47.5:7.w1-w4^by faith for we walk,
47.5:7.w5-w7^not by sight.
47.5:8.w1-w2^we are confident now,
47.5:8.w3-w14^and are pleased, rather to be absent out of the body, and to be at home with the lord.
47.5:8.w6-w9^to be absent out of the body,
47.5:8.w10-w14^and to be at home with the lord.
47.5:9.w1-w10^therefore also we are ambitious, whether being at home or being away, well-pleasing to him to be.
47.5:9.w4-w5^whether being at home
47.5:9.w6-w7^or being away,
47.6:1.w1-w2^working together now

47.6:12.w5-w10^you are restrained however in the affections of you.
47.6:13.w1-w4^- now [as] the same recompense,
47.6:13.w1^-
47.6:13.w5-w7^as to children i speak,
47.6:13.w8-w10^be expanded also you.
47.6:14.w1-w4^not become unequally yoked together with unbelievers;

47.6:14.w11-w16^or what fellowship light with darkness?
47.6:15.w1-w6^what now harmony christ with belial?
47.6:15.w7-w12^or what part to a believer with an unbeliever?
47.6:16.w1-w7^what now agreement [the] temple of god with idols?
47.6:16.w8-w13^we for [the] temple of god are, [the] living,

47.6:3.w1-w5^nothing before no one placing an obstacle,
47.6:3.w1^nothing
47.6:3.w6-w10^so that not should be blemished the ministry,
47.6:4.w1-w8^rather, in everything, we are commending ourselves as god’s servants,

47.7:11.w28-w32^yourselves innocent to be in this matter.
47.7:12.w1-w5^so if even i wrote to you,
47.7:12.w6-w28^[it was] not for the sake of the [one] having done wrong, nor for the sake of the [one] having suffered wrong, but rather for the sake of - being revealed the earnestness of you, which [is] for us to you before - god.

48.1:9.w14-w15^accursed let him be!
48.2:1.w1-w13^then after fourteen years again i went up to jerusalem with barnabas, having taken with [me] also titus.
48.2:1.w11-w13^having taken with [me] also titus.
48.2:10.w1_2^only [they asked]
48.2:10.w2-w5^the poor that we should remember,
48.2:10.w6-w11^that also i was eager the same thing to do.
48.2:10.w9-w11^the same thing to do.
48.2:11.w1-w6^when however came peter to antioch,
48.2:11.w7-w10^to face his i opposed [him],
48.2:11.w11-w13^because condemned he stood.
48.2:11.w12_2^condemned
48.2:12.w1-w7^before - for, came certain ones from james,
48.2:12.w1-w2^before -
48.2:12.w12-w14^when however they came,
48.2:12.w15_2^he was drawing back
48.2:12.w16-w22^and was separating himself, being afraid of those of [the] circumcision.
48.2:12.w19-w22^being afraid of those of [the] circumcision.
48.2:13.w1-w7^and acted hypocritically with him also the rest of [the] jews,
48.2:13.w8-w14^so that even barnabas was carried away of them by the hypocrisy.
48.2:14.w1-w3^but when i saw
48.2:14.w4-w11^that not they are walking uprightly according to the truth of the gospel,
48.2:14.w12-w16^i said - to peter before all,
48.2:14.w17-w25^if you, a jew being, like a gentile and not like a jew live,
48.2:14.w19-w20^a jew being,

48.2:16.w22-w26^that we may be justified by faith from christ,
48.2:16.w27-w31^and not by works of the law;
48.2:16.w32-w39^because by works of the law not will be justified any flesh.
48.2:17.w1-w10^if however seeking to be justified in christ, have been found also we ourselves sinners,
48.2:17.w3-w6^seeking to be justified in christ,
48.2:17.w4-w6^to be justified in christ,
48.2:17.w11-w14^[is] then christ of sin a minister?
48.2:17.w15-w16^never may it be!
48.2:18.w1-w4^if for that i had torn down,
48.2:18.w5-w7^these things again i build,
48.2:18.w8-w10^a transgressor myself i prove.
48.2:19.w1-w6^i for, through [the] law to [the] law died,
48.2:19.w7-w9^that to god i might live.
48.2:19.w10-w11^christ i have been crucified with;
48.2:2.w1-w4^i went up now according to a revelation
48.2:2.w5-w9^and set before them the gospel
48.2:2.w10-w14^that i proclaim among the gentiles —
48.2:2.w15-w19^apart individually however to those esteemed —
48.2:2.w18-w19_2^to those esteemed —
48.2:2.w20-w24^lest hardly in vain i should be running
48.2:2.w25-w26^or have run.
48.2:20.w1-w4^i live now, no longer i;
48.2:20.w5-w9^lives however in me christ;
48.2:20.w10-w15^that which then now i live in [the] flesh,
48.2:20.w16-w17^through faith
48.2:20.w24-w26^the [one] having loved me
48.2:20.w27-w31^and having given up himself for me.
48.2:21.w1-w6^not i do set aside the grace - of god;
48.2:21.w7-w11^if for through [the] law righteousness [is],
48.2:21.w12-w15^then christ for naught died.”
48.2:3.w1-w10^but not even titus who [was] with me, a greek being, was compelled to be circumcised,

48.2:3.w10_2^to be circumcised,
48.2:4.w1-w5^because of even the brought in secretly false brothers,

48.2:4.w12-w16^which we have in christ jesus,
48.2:4.w17-w19^that us they will enslave,

48.2:5.w8-w15^so that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.

48.3:1.w7-w13^whose before eyes jesus christ was publicly portrayed [as] having been crucified?
48.3:1.w13_2^[as] having been crucified?
48.3:10.w1_2^as many as
48.3:10.w10-w11^it has been written for
48.3:10.w12-w28^-: cursed [is] everyone who not does continue all things - having been written in the book of the law, - to do them.”

48.3:11.w1-w9^that now by [the] law no one is justified before - god
48.3:11.w11-w16^because the righteous by faith will live.”
48.3:12.w1-w7^- and the law not is of faith;
48.3:12.w1^-
48.3:12.w8-w14^rather, the [one] having done these things will live by them.”
48.3:12.w9-w11^the [one] having done these things
48.3:13.w1-w12^christ us redeemed from the curse of the law, having become for us a curse,
48.3:13.w9-w12^having become for us a curse,
48.3:13.w13-w14^for it has been written:

48.3:13.w16-w20^everyone - hanging on a tree”
48.3:14.w1-w12^so that to the gentiles the blessing - of abraham might come, in christ, jesus
48.3:14.w13-w21^so that the promise of the spirit we might receive, through - faith.
48.3:15.w1-w4^brothers, according to man i am speaking.
48.3:15.w5-w10^even of man having been ratified a covenant, no one sets aside

48.3:15.w11-w12^or adds thereto.
48.3:16.w1-w10^- and to abraham were spoken the promises, and to the seed of him.
48.3:16.w1_2^-
48.3:16.w3_2^to abraham
48.3:16.w11-w18^not it does say, and - to seeds, as of many;
48.3:16.w13-w15_2^and - to seeds,
48.3:16.w19-w26^but as of one, and to the seed of you,”
48.3:16.w23-w26_2^and to the seed of you,”
48.3:16.w27-w29^who is christ.
48.3:17.w1-w3^this now i say:
48.3:17.w4-w23^[the] covenant, having been confirmed beforehand by - god, - afterward four hundred and thirty years having come, [the] law not does annul, so as - to nullify the promise.
48.3:17.w5-w8^having been confirmed beforehand by - god,
48.3:17.w10-w15^afterward four hundred and thirty years having come,
48.3:17.w19-w23^so as - to nullify the promise.
48.3:18.w1-w6^if for by [the] law [is] the inheritance,
48.3:18.w7-w9^[it is] no longer by a promise;
48.3:18.w10-w17^- but to abraham through a promise has granted [it] - god.
48.3:18.w10^-
48.3:19.w1-w4^why then the law?
48.3:19.w5-w21^- transgressions on account of, it was added, until that should have come the seed to whom promise has been made, having been ordained through angels in [the] hand of a mediator.
48.3:19.w5^-
48.3:19.w9-w15^until that should have come the seed to whom promise has been made,
48.3:19.w14-w15^to whom promise has been made,
48.3:19.w16-w21^having been ordained through angels in [the] hand of a mediator.
48.3:2.w1_2^this
48.3:2.w7-w16^by works of [the] law the spirit did you receive, or by hearing of faith?
48.3:20.w1-w6^- however, a mediator of one [person] not is;
48.3:20.w1^-
48.3:20.w7-w11^- but god one is.
48.3:20.w7^-
48.3:21.w1-w8^the therefore law [is] contrary to the promises - of god?
48.3:21.w1^the
48.3:21.w9-w10^never may it be!
48.3:21.w11-w17^if for had been given a law - being able to impart life,
48.3:21.w15-w17^- being able to impart life,
48.3:21.w17_2^to impart life,
48.3:21.w18-w24^indeed from out of [the] law - would have emerged - righteousness;
48.3:22.w1-w8^but imprisoned the scripture things all under sin,
48.3:22.w9-w18^so that the promise, by faith from jesus christ, might be given to those believing.
48.3:22.w17-w18_2^to those believing.
48.3:23.w1-w2_2^before -
48.3:23.w10-w15^having been locked up until the being about faith to be revealed,
48.3:23.w15_2^to be revealed,
48.3:24.w1-w8^so that the law trainer of us has become, unto christ,
48.3:24.w9-w12^so that by faith we might be justified.
48.3:25.w1-w4^having come now - faith,
48.3:25.w5-w8^no longer under a trainer we are.
48.3:26.w1-w11^all for sons of god you are through - faith in christ jesus.
48.3:27.w1_2^as many as
48.3:28.w1-w5^neither there is jew nor greek;
48.3:28.w6-w10^neither there is slave nor free;
48.3:28.w11-w15^neither there is male and female;
48.3:28.w16-w23^all for you one are in christ jesus.
48.3:28.w16^all
48.3:29.w1-w4^if now you [are] christ’s,
48.3:29.w5-w12^then - abraham’s seed you are, according to [the] promise heirs.
48.3:3.w1-w3^so foolish are you?
48.3:3.w4-w5^having begun in [the] spirit,
48.3:4.w1-w3^so many things did you suffer in vain,
48.3:4.w4-w7^if indeed also in vain?
48.3:5.w1_2^the [one]
48.3:5.w3-w6^supplying to you the spirit
48.3:5.w7-w11^and working miracles among you,
48.3:6.w1-w5^so also, abraham believed - god,
48.3:6.w6-w10^and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.”
48.3:7.w1-w2^know then
48.3:7.w3-w6^that those of faith,
48.3:7.w7-w10^these sons are of abraham.
48.3:7.w8^sons
48.3:8.w1_2^having foreseen
48.3:8.w5-w12^that by faith justifies the gentiles - god,
48.3:8.w16-w22^-: will be blessed in you all the nations.”
48.3:9.w1-w9^so then, those of faith are blessed along with the believing abraham.
48.4:1.w1-w2^i say now,
48.4:1.w3-w9^for as long as time the heir a child is,
48.4:1.w10-w15^not he differs from a slave, [though] owner of everything being.
48.4:1.w13-w15^[though] owner of everything being.
48.4:10.w1-w8^days you observe, and months and seasons and years.
48.4:10.w1_2^days
48.4:11.w1-w2^i fear for you,
48.4:11.w3-w8^lest perhaps in vain i have toiled for you.
48.4:12.w1-w3^become as i [am],
48.4:12.w4-w7^because i also [have become] as you,
48.4:12.w8-w10^brothers, i implore you.
48.4:12.w11-w13^in nothing me have you wronged.
48.4:13.w1-w2^you know now
48.4:13.w3-w11^that in weakness of the flesh i proclaimed the gospel to you at the first;
48.4:14.w1-w10^and the test of you in the flesh of me, not you did despise [me],
48.4:14.w11-w12^nor reject [me] with contempt;
48.4:14.w13-w21^but as an angel of god, you received me even as christ jesus.
48.4:15.w1-w5^what then the blessedness of you?
48.4:15.w6-w8^i bear witness for to you
48.4:15.w9-w11^that, if possible,
48.4:15.w12-w15^the eyes of you having gouged out,
48.4:16.w1-w6^so enemy of you have i become, speaking truth to you?
48.4:16.w5-w6^speaking truth to you?
48.4:17.w1-w4^they are zealous after you not rightly,
48.4:17.w5-w8^but to exclude you [from us]. they desire
48.4:17.w6-w7^to exclude you [from us].
48.4:17.w9-w11^so that them you might be zealous after.
48.4:18.w1-w15^good [it is] now to be zealous in a right [thing] at all times, and not only in - being present my with you.
48.4:18.w3-w6^to be zealous in a right [thing] at all times,
48.4:18.w7-w15^and not only in - being present my with you.
48.4:18.w10-w15^in - being present my with you.
48.4:19.w1-w2_2^children of me,
48.4:19.w3-w11^of whom again i travail until that shall have been formed christ in you,
48.4:19.w6-w11^until that shall have been formed christ in you,
48.4:2.w1-w11^instead, under guardians he is, and trustees, until the time appointed by [his] father.
48.4:2.w2-w3_2^under guardians
48.4:20.w1-w11^i was wishing indeed to be present with you presently and to change the tone of me,
48.4:20.w3-w6^to be present with you presently
48.4:20.w7-w11^and to change the tone of me,
48.4:20.w12-w15^because i am perplexed as to you.
48.4:21.w1-w7^tell me, those under [the] law wishing to be,
48.4:21.w3-w7^those under [the] law wishing to be,
48.4:21.w4-w5_2^under [the] law
48.4:21.w3^those
48.4:21.w8-w11^the law not you do listen to?
48.4:22.w1-w2^it has been written for
48.4:22.w3-w16^that abraham two sons had, one of the slave woman and one of the free.
48.4:22.w5-w6^two sons
48.4:23.w1-w9^but the [one] indeed of the slave woman, according to flesh has been born;
48.4:23.w2^the [one]
48.4:23.w10-w16^the [one] but of the free, through [the] promise,
48.4:23.w10^the [one]
48.4:24.w1-w3^which things are allegorized;
48.4:24.w3_2^allegorized;
48.4:24.w4-w8^these for are two covenants:
48.4:24.w9-w16^one indeed from mount sinai, unto slavery begetting,
48.4:24.w14-w16^unto slavery begetting,
48.4:24.w17-w19^which is hagar.
48.4:25.w1-w9^- and hagar sinai mount is, in - arabia;
48.4:25.w1^-
48.4:25.w10-w14^she corresponds now to the present jerusalem,
48.4:25.w15-w20^she is in slavery for with the children of her.
48.4:26.w1-w6^- but the above jerusalem free is,
48.4:26.w1^-
48.4:26.w7-w10^who is mother of us.
48.4:27.w1-w2^it has been written for:
48.4:27.w3-w7^rejoice, o barren woman, the [one] not bearing;
48.4:27.w5-w7^the [one] not bearing;
48.4:27.w5^the [one]
48.4:27.w8_2^break forth
48.4:27.w9-w13^and call aloud, the [one] not travailing;
48.4:27.w11-w13^the [one] not travailing;
48.4:27.w11^the [one]
48.4:27.w14-w20^because many [are] the children of the desolate woman more,
48.4:27.w21-w25^than of her having the husband.”
48.4:27.w22-w25^of her having the husband.”
48.4:28.w1-w8^you now, brothers, like isaac, of promise children are.
48.4:29.w1-w11^but just as at that time the [one] according to flesh having been born was persecuting the [one born] according to spirit,
48.4:29.w4-w7^the [one] according to flesh having been born
48.4:29.w4^the [one]
48.4:29.w12-w14^so also [it is] now.
48.4:3.w1-w6^so also we, when we were children,
48.4:3.w7-w11_2^under the basic principles of the world
48.4:30.w1-w5^but what says the scripture?
48.4:30.w6-w12^cast out the slave woman and the son of her;
48.4:30.w13-w25^no for not will inherit the son of the slave woman along with the son of the free.”
48.4:30.w13^no
48.4:31.w1-w6^so then, brothers, not we are of [the] slave woman children,
48.4:31.w7-w9^but of the free.
48.4:4.w1-w7^when however had come the fullness of the time,
48.4:4.w8-w19^sent forth - god the son of him, having been born of a woman, having been born under [the] law,
48.4:4.w14-w16^having been born of a woman,
48.4:4.w17-w19^having been born under [the] law,
48.4:5.w1-w5^that those under [the] law he might redeem,
48.4:5.w6-w9^so that the divine adoption as sons we might receive.
48.4:6.w1-w4^because now you are sons,
48.4:6.w5-w17^sent forth - god the spirit of the son of him into the hearts of us, crying out,
48.4:6.w17_2^crying out,
48.4:6.w18-w20_2^abba, - father!
48.4:7.w1-w4^so no longer you are a slave,
48.4:7.w5-w6^but a son;
48.4:7.w7-w9^if now a son,
48.4:7.w10-w13^also an heir through god.
48.4:8.w1-w12^but at that time indeed not knowing god, you were enslaved to those by nature not being gods;
48.4:8.w4-w6^not knowing god,
48.4:8.w9-w11^by nature not being
48.4:9.w1-w18^now however, having known god, rather however having been known by god, how do you turn again to the weak and destitute principles,
48.4:9.w3-w4^having known god,
48.4:9.w5-w9^rather however having been known by god,
48.4:9.w19-w22^to which again anew to be enslaved
48.5:1.w1-w5^in freedom, us christ has set free;
48.5:1.w6-w7^stand firm, therefore,
48.5:1.w8-w13^and not again in a yoke of slavery entangle yourselves.
48.5:10.w1-w6^i am confident as to you in [the] lord,
48.5:10.w7-w10^that no other mind will you have.
48.5:10.w11-w14^the [one] however troubling you
48.5:10.w11^the [one]
48.5:10.w18-w20^whoever if he might be.
48.5:11.w1-w3^i now, brothers,
48.5:11.w4-w7^if circumcision still proclaim,
48.5:11.w8-w10^why still am i persecuted?
48.5:11.w11-w16^in that case has been abolished the offense of the cross.
48.5:12.w1-w6^i wish also will emasculate themselves those upsetting you.
48.5:12.w4-w6^those upsetting you.
48.5:13.w1-w6^you for to freedom were called, brothers;
48.5:13.w7-w14^but not the freedom for an opportunity to the flesh.
48.5:13.w15-w20^rather through - love, serve one another.
48.5:14.w1-w16^- for the entire law in one word is fulfilled in this: you shall love the neighbor of you as yourself.”
48.5:14.w1^-
48.5:14.w9-w16^in this: you shall love the neighbor of you as yourself.”
48.5:15.w1-w4^if however one another you bite
48.5:15.w5-w6^and devour,
48.5:15.w7_2^take heed,
48.5:15.w8-w11^lest by one another you might be consumed.
48.5:16.w1-w2^i say now,
48.5:16.w3-w4^by [the] spirit walk,
48.5:16.w5-w10^and [the] desire [of the] flesh no not you should gratify.
48.5:17.w1-w7^the for flesh desires, against the spirit,
48.5:17.w1^the
48.5:17.w8-w13^- and the spirit against the flesh;
48.5:17.w8^-
48.5:17.w14-w17^these for to one another are opposed,
48.5:17.w18-w22^in order not that if you might wish
48.5:17.w23-w24^those things you should do.
48.5:18.w1-w4^if however [the] spirit you are led by,
48.5:18.w5-w8^not you are under [the] law.
48.5:19.w1-w7^evident now are the works of the flesh,
48.5:19.w8-21.w7^which are sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, contentions, dissensions, factions, envyings, drunkennesses, carousing, and things like these,
48.5:2.w1_2^behold,
48.5:2.w2-w5^i paul say to you
48.5:2.w6-w8^that if you shall become circumcised,
48.5:2.w9-w12^christ you nothing will profit.
48.5:21.w8-w10^as to which i forewarn you,
48.5:21.w11-w12^even as i warned before,
48.5:21.w13-w21^that those such things doing, kingdom god’s not will inherit.
48.5:21.w14-w17^those such things doing,
48.5:21.w14^those
48.5:22.w1-23.w2^- but the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control;
48.5:22.w1^-
48.5:23.w3-w8^against things such, no there is law.
48.5:24.w1-w14^those now - of christ jesus, the flesh have crucified with [its] passions and - desires.
48.5:24.w1^those
48.5:25.w1-w3^if we live by [the] spirit,
48.5:25.w4-w6^by [the] spirit also we should walk.
48.5:26.w1-w7^not we should become boastful, one another provoking, one another envying.
48.5:26.w4-w5^one another provoking,
48.5:26.w6-w7^one another envying.
48.5:3.w1-w6^i testify now again to every man being circumcised
48.5:3.w6_2^being circumcised
48.5:3.w7-w13^that a debtor he is all the law to keep.
48.5:3.w10-w13^all the law to keep.
48.5:4.w1-w3^you are severed from christ,
48.5:4.w4-w7^whoever in [the] law are being justified;
48.5:4.w8-w10^from grace you have fallen away.
48.5:5.w1-w8^we for, through [the] spirit by faith, [the] hope of righteousness eagerly await.
48.5:6.w1-w10^in for christ jesus, neither circumcision any has power, nor uncircumcision;
48.5:6.w1^in
48.5:6.w6_2^circumcision
48.5:6.w11-w15^but only faith through love working.
48.5:6.w13-w15^through love working.
48.5:7.w1-w2^you were running well.
48.5:7.w3-w9^who you cut into, the truth not to obey?

52.3:9.w14-w21^that we rejoice because of you, before the god of us,
52.4:1.w1-w5^finally then, brothers, we implore you
52.4:1.w6-w10^and exhort in [the] lord jesus
52.4:1.w11-w23^that, just as you have received from us - in what manner it behooves you to walk and to please god,
52.4:1.w16-w23^- in what manner it behooves you to walk and to please god,
52.4:1.w16^-
52.4:1.w19-w20^you to walk
52.4:1.w21-w23^and to please god,
52.4:1.w24-w26^just as even you walk [now],
52.4:1.w27-w29^so you should abound more.
52.4:10.w1-w13^and for you are doing this toward all the brothers, the [ones] in all - macedonia.
52.4:10.w14-11.w13^we exhort however you, brothers, to abound more and more, and to strive earnestly to live quietly and to attend to the own, and to work with the own hands of you,
52.4:10.w18-w19^to abound more and more,
52.4:11.w1-w13^and to strive earnestly to live quietly and to attend to the own, and to work with the own hands of you,

52.4:14.w1-w3^if for we believe
52.4:14.w4-w6^that jesus died
52.4:14.w7-w8^and rose again,
52.4:14.w9-w20^so also - god, those having fallen asleep through - jesus, will bring with him.
52.4:14.w13-w17^those having fallen asleep through - jesus,
52.4:15.w1-w7^this for to you we declare in [the] word of [the] lord,
52.4:15.w8-w23^that we the living - remaining, unto the coming of the lord no not shall precede those having fallen asleep,

52.4:15.w12-w18^- remaining, unto the coming of the lord
52.4:15.w22-w23_2^those having fallen asleep,
52.4:16.w1-w16^because himself the lord with a loud command, with the voice of an archangel, and with [the] trumpet of god, will descend from heaven,
52.4:16.w17-w23^and the dead in christ will rise first.
52.4:17.w1-w18^then we the living - remaining, together with them, will be caught away in [the] clouds for [the] meeting of the lord in [the] air;
52.4:17.w3-w4_2^the living
52.4:17.w5-w6_2^- remaining,
52.4:17.w19-w24^and so always with [the] lord we will be.

52.4:6.w1^-
52.4:6.w4-w11^and to overreach in the matter, the brother of him,
52.4:6.w12-w17^because avenging [is] [the] lord concerning all these things,

58.4:10.w15-w20^as from the own - god [did].
58.4:11.w1-w7^we should be diligent therefore to enter into that - rest,
58.4:11.w3-w7^to enter into that - rest,
58.4:11.w8-w17^so that not by the same anyone example should fall - of disobedience.
58.4:11.w10-w12^by the same

58.4:14.w1_2^having
58.4:14.w5-w7^having passed through the heavens,
58.4:15.w1-w18^not for have we a high priest not being able to sympathize with the weaknesses of us; [one] having been tempted however in all things by the same way, without sin.
58.4:15.w5-w10^not being able to sympathize with the weaknesses of us;
58.4:15.w7-w10^to sympathize with the weaknesses of us;
58.4:15.w11-w18^[one] having been tempted however in all things by the same way, without sin.
58.4:16.w1-w8^we should come therefore with boldness to the throne - of grace,
58.4:16.w9-w11^so that we may receive mercy
58.4:16.w12-w17^and grace may find for in time of need help.
58.4:2.w1-w4^and for we are [those] having had the gospel preached
58.4:2.w4_2^having had the gospel preached
58.4:2.w5-w6^just as they [did];
58.4:2.w7-w20^but not did profit the message of [their] hearing them, not having been united with the faith of those having heard.
58.4:2.w15-w20^not having been united with the faith of those having heard.
58.4:2.w19-w20_2^of those having heard.
58.4:3.w1-w7^we enter for into the rest, those having believed;
58.4:3.w6-w7_2^those having believed;
58.4:3.w8-w9^as he has said:
58.4:3.w10-w15^so i swore in the wrath of me,
58.4:3.w16-w21^not shall they enter into the rest of me.’”
58.4:3.w22-w28^and yet the works from [the] foundation of [the] world have been finished.
58.4:4.w1-w6^he has spoken for somewhere concerning the seventh [day]
58.4:4.w7-w21^in this way, and rested - god on the day - seventh from all the works of him.”
58.4:5.w1-w4^and in this [passage] again,
58.4:5.w5-w10^[not] shall they enter into the rest of me.
58.4:6.w1-w7^since therefore it remains [for] some to enter into it,
58.4:6.w4-w7^some to enter into it,
58.4:6.w8-w15^and those formerly having received the good news, not did enter in because of disobedience,

58.4:8.w1-w5^if for to them joshua had given rest,
58.4:8.w6-w13^not - about another he would have spoken after this day.
58.4:9.w1-w7^so then there remains a sabbath rest for the people - of god.
58.5:1.w1-w13^every for high priest, from among men being taken, on behalf of men is appointed, in things relating to - god
58.5:1.w1_2^every

58.5:11.w1-w9^concerning this [there is] much from us - speech, and difficult in interpretation to speak,
58.5:11.w3_2^[there is] much

58.5:2.w1_2^to exercise forbearance
58.5:2.w6_2^going astray,
58.5:2.w7-w11^since also he himself is encompassed by weakness;
58.5:3.w1-w15^and because of this he is obligated, just as for the people, so also for himself, to offer sacrifices for sins.
58.5:3.w5-w8^just as for the people,
58.5:4.w1-w7^and not upon himself anyone takes the honor,

58.5:4.w13-w15^just as also aaron.
58.5:5.w1-w9^so also - christ not himself did glorify to become a high priest,

58.5:7.w1-w24^[he] in the days of the flesh of him, prayers both and supplications, to the [one] being able to save him from death, with crying loud and tears having offered up,

58.5:8.w1-w3^though being a son,

58.5:9.w1-10.w9^and having been perfected, he became to all those obeying him, [the] author of salvation eternal, having been designated by - god a high priest according to the order of melchizedek.
58.5:9.w2_2^having been perfected,
58.5:9.w4-w7^to all those obeying him,
58.5:9.w4-w7_2^to all those obeying him,
58.6:1.w1-2.w11^therefore, having left the - beginning of the christ teaching, to - maturity we should go on, not again a foundation laying of repentance from dead works, and faith in god, about baptisms instruction, of laying on then of hands, of [the] resurrection both of [the] dead and of judgment eternal.

58.6:12.w7^of those
58.6:13.w1_2^-

62.2:1.w13-w20^an advocate we have with the father, jesus christ [the] righteous [one].
62.2:1.w13^an advocate
62.2:10.w1-w5^the [one] loving the brother of him,
62.2:10.w10-w15^and cause for stumbling in him not there is.
62.2:11.w1-w6^the [one] however hating the brother of him,
62.2:11.w1^the [one]
62.2:11.w11-w15^and in the darkness walks;

62.2:11.w19-w20^where he is going,

62.2:12.w1-w3^i am writing to you, little children,

62.2:16.w26-w30^but from the world is.
62.2:17.w1-w4^and the world is passing away,

62.2:19.w1-w3^from among us they went out,
62.2:19.w4-w8^but not they were of us;
62.2:19.w9-w13^if for of us they had been,
62.2:19.w14-w17^they would have remained - with us.
62.2:19.w18-w20^but [it is] so that it might be made manifest
62.2:19.w21-w26^that not they are all of us.

62.2:2.w9-w14^not for the of ours and only,
62.2:2.w15-w20^but also for all the world.

62.2:22.w7-w8_2^the [one] denying
62.2:22.w9-w14^that jesus not is the christ?
62.2:22.w15-w25^this is the antichrist, the [one] denying the father and the son.
62.2:22.w19-w25^the [one] denying the father and the son.
62.2:23.w1-w9^everyone - denying the son, neither the father has he.
62.2:23.w2-w5^- denying the son,
62.2:23.w10-w13^the [one] confessing the son,
62.2:24.w1_2^you,
62.2:24.w2-w5^what you have heard from [the] beginning,
62.2:24.w9-w16^if in you should abide what from [the] beginning you have heard,
62.2:24.w13-w16^what from [the] beginning you have heard,
62.2:24.w17-w26^also you in the son and in the father will abide.
62.2:25.w1-w9^and this is the promise that he promised us:

62.2:27.w5-w8^that you received from him,
62.2:27.w12-w15^and not need you have
62.2:27.w16-w19^that anyone should teach you.
62.2:27.w20-w28^but just as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things,
62.2:27.w29-w31^and true is,
62.2:27.w32-w35^and not is a lie;
62.2:27.w36-w39^and just as it has taught you,
62.2:27.w40-w42^you shall abide in him.
62.2:28.w1-w6^and now, little children, abide in him,
62.2:28.w7-w9^so that when he appears
62.2:28.w10-w11^we might have boldness
62.2:28.w12-w20^and not be ashamed before him at the coming of him.
62.2:29.w1-w2^if you know

62.2:29.w10-w13^- practicing - righteousness,
62.2:3.w1-w4^and by this we know

62.2:3.w8-w12^if the commandments of him we should keep.
62.2:4.w1-w2_2^the [one] saying

62.2:4.w6-w11^and the commandments of him not keeping,
62.2:4.w14-w20^and in him the truth not is.
62.2:5.w1-w7^whoever however - may keep his - word,
62.2:5.w8-w15^truly in him the love - of god has been perfected.
62.2:5.w16-w18^by this we know
62.2:5.w19-w22^that in him we are:
62.2:6.w1-w5^the [one] claiming in him to abide,
62.2:6.w5_2^to abide,
62.2:6.w7-w9^just as that walk

62.3:12.w13-w17^and because of what he slayed him?
62.3:12.w18-w23^because the works of him evil were,
62.3:12.w24-w29^those however of the brother of him, righteous.
62.3:12.w24^those
62.3:13.w1-w4^and not be surprised, brothers,

62.3:15.w18-w20^in him abiding.
62.3:16.w1-w5^by this we have known - love,
62.3:16.w6-w13^because he for us the life of him laid down;
62.3:16.w14-w22^and we ought for [our] brothers, [our] lives to lay down.
62.3:16.w20-w22^[our] lives to lay down.
62.3:17.w1-w8^whoever now - might have the goods of the world,

62.3:17.w14-w15^need having,
62.3:17.w16-w22^and might close up the heart of him from him,
62.3:17.w23-w30^how the love - of god abides in him?
62.3:18.w1-w7^little children, not we should love in word, nor in tongue,
62.3:18.w8-w12^but in action and in truth.

62.3:2.w21-w22^as he is.
62.3:20.w1-w6^that if should condemn [us] our - heart,
62.3:20.w7-w14^that greater than is - god the heart of us,
62.3:20.w8^greater than

62.3:3.w12-w15^just as he pure is.
62.3:4.w1-w5^everyone - committing - sin,
62.3:4.w10-w15^and - sin is - lawlessness.
62.3:5.w1-w2^and you know
62.3:5.w3-w5^that he appeared
62.3:5.w6-w9^so that - sins he might take away;
62.3:5.w10-w15^and sin in him not there is.
62.3:6.w1-w5^anyone - in him abiding,
62.3:6.w1-w2^anyone -
62.3:6.w8-w10_2^anyone - sinning,

62.3:7.w11-w14^just as he righteous is.
62.3:8.w1-w4^the [one] practicing - sin,
62.3:8.w9-w14^because from [the] beginning the devil has been sinning.
62.3:8.w15-w21^for this [reason] was revealed the son - of god,
62.3:8.w22-w27^so that he might destroy the works of the devil.
62.3:9.w1-w6^anyone - having been born of - god,
62.3:9.w10-w15^because seed of him in him abides,
62.3:9.w16-w19^and not he is able to continue sinning,
62.3:9.w19_2^to continue sinning,
62.3:9.w20-w24^because of - god he has been born.
62.4:1.w1-w5^beloved, not every spirit believe,
62.4:1.w6-w9^but test the spirits,
62.4:1.w10-w14^whether of - god they are,
62.4:1.w15-w21^because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
62.4:10.w1-w5^in this is - love,
62.4:10.w6-w11^not that we loved - god,
62.4:10.w12-w16^but that he loved us
62.4:10.w17-w26^and sent the son of him [as] a propitiation for the sins of us.
62.4:11.w1-w7^beloved, if so - god loved us,
62.4:11.w8-w12^also we ought one another to love.
62.4:11.w11-w12^one another to love.
62.4:12.w1-w4^god no one at any time has seen;
62.4:12.w5-w7^if we should love one another,
62.4:12.w8-w12^- god in us abides
62.4:12.w13-w20^and the love of him in us having been perfected is.
62.4:12.w19_2^having been perfected
62.4:13.w1-w3^by this we know
62.4:13.w4-w7^that in him we abide,
62.4:13.w8-w11^and he in us,
62.4:13.w12-w18^because from out the spirit of him he has given to us.
62.4:14.w1-w3^and we have seen
62.4:14.w4-w5^and testify
62.4:14.w6-w14^that the father has sent the son [as] savior of the world.
62.4:15.w1-w3^whoever if shall confess
62.4:15.w4-w10^that jesus is the son - of god,

62.4:15.w16-w20^and he in - god.
62.4:16.w1-w3^and we have come to know
62.4:16.w4-w13^and have come to believe the love that has - god as to us.
62.4:16.w8-w13^that has - god as to us.
62.4:16.w14-w17^- god love is,
62.4:16.w18-w27^and the [one] abiding in - love, in - god abides,
62.4:16.w19-w23^the [one] abiding in - love,
62.4:16.w28-w33^and - god in him abides.
62.4:17.w1-w7^in this has been perfected - love with us,
62.4:17.w8-w15^so that confidence we may have in the day - of judgment,
62.4:17.w16-w19^that just as he is,
62.4:17.w20-w26^also we are in the world this.
62.4:18.w1-w6^fear no there is in - love,
62.4:18.w7-w14^but - perfect love out casts - fear,
62.4:18.w15-w19^because the fear punishment has;
62.4:18.w20_2^the [one]
62.4:19.w1-w2^we love
62.4:19.w3-w7^because he first loved us.
62.4:2.w1-w7^by this you know the spirit - of god:
62.4:2.w8-w20^every spirit that confesses jesus christ in [the] flesh having come, of - god is;
62.4:2.w10-w16^that confesses jesus christ in [the] flesh having come,
62.4:2.w14-w16^in [the] flesh having come,
62.4:20.w1-w3^if anyone should say
62.4:20.w4-w7^-, i love - god,
62.4:20.w8-w12^and the brother of him should hate,
62.4:20.w13-w14^a liar he is.
62.4:20.w15_2^the [one]
62.4:20.w22-w23^whom he has seen,

62.4:20.w26-w28^whom not he has seen,
62.4:21.w1-w7^and this the commandment we have from him,
62.4:21.w8-w17^that the [one] loving - god should love also the brother of him.
62.4:21.w9-w12^the [one] loving - god
62.4:3.w1-w13^and any spirit that not confesses - jesus, from - god not is.
62.4:3.w4-w8^that not confesses - jesus,
62.4:3.w14-w19^and this is that of the antichrist,
62.4:3.w20-w21^which you heard
62.4:3.w22-w23^that is coming,
62.4:3.w24-w30^and now in the world is already.
62.4:4.w1-w6^you from - god are, little children,
62.4:4.w7-w9^and have overcome them,
62.4:4.w10-w15^because greater is the [one] in you
62.4:4.w16-w20^than the [one] in the world.
62.4:5.w1-w5^they of the world are;
62.4:5.w6-w11^because of this from out of the world they speak,
62.4:5.w12-w16^and the world them listens to.
62.4:6.w1-w5^we of - god are.
62.4:6.w6-w9^the [one] knowing - god
62.4:6.w12-w17^he who not is from - god,
62.4:6.w21-w32^by this we know the spirit - of truth and the spirit - of falsehood.
62.4:7.w1-w3^beloved, we should love one another,
62.4:7.w4-w10^because - love from - god is;
62.4:7.w11-w18^and everyone - loving, from - god has been born,
62.4:7.w12-w14_2^everyone - loving,
62.4:7.w19-w22^and knows - god.
62.4:8.w1-w3^the [one] not loving,
62.4:8.w1^the [one]
62.4:8.w8-w12^because - god love is.
62.4:9.w1-w9^in this has been revealed the love - of god among us,
62.4:9.w10-w21^that the son of him, the one and only, has sent - god into the world,
62.4:9.w22-w25^so that we might live through him.
62.5:1.w1-w3_2^everyone - believing
62.5:1.w4-w8^that jesus is the christ,
62.5:1.w13-w24^and everyone - loving the [one] having begotten [him], loves also the [one] having been begotten from him.

62.5:10.w1-w7^the [one] believing in the son - of god
62.5:10.w13-w17^the [one] not believing - god,
62.5:10.w13^the [one]
62.5:10.w21-w34^because not he has believed in the testimony that has testified - god concerning the son him.
62.5:10.w27-w34^that has testified - god concerning the son him.
62.5:11.w1-w5^and this is the testimony,
62.5:11.w6-w12^that life eternal has given to us, - god
62.5:11.w13-w21^and this the life in the son his is.
62.5:12.w1-w4^the [one] having the son
62.5:12.w8-w14^the [one] not having the son - of god,

62.5:14.w1-w9^and this is the confidence that we have toward him,
62.5:14.w6-w9^that we have toward him,
62.5:14.w10-w17^that if anything we might ask according to the will of him,
62.5:14.w18-w19^he hears us.
62.5:15.w1-w3^and if we know
62.5:15.w4-w6^that he hears us,
62.5:15.w7-w9^whatever if we might ask,
62.5:15.w10_2^we know
62.5:15.w11-w18^that we have the requests that we have asked from him.
62.5:15.w15-w18^that we have asked from him.

62.5:16.w13-w21^and he will give him life, to those sinning not unto death.
62.5:16.w17-w21^to those sinning not unto death.
62.5:16.w22-w25^there is a sin unto death;

62.5:17.w1-w4^all unrighteousness sin is,
62.5:17.w5-w10^and there is sin not unto death.
62.5:18.w1_2^we know
62.5:18.w2-w10^that everyone - having been born of - god not continues to sin,
62.5:18.w3-w8^everyone - having been born of - god
62.5:18.w11-w18^but the [one] having been begotten of - god protects him,
62.5:18.w12-w16^the [one] having been begotten of - god
62.5:18.w19-w24^and the evil [one] not does touch him.
62.5:19.w1_2^we know

66.14:20.w1-w7^and was trodden the winepress outside the city,

66.14:3.w1-w16^and they are singing as a song new before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders.

66.15:1.w18-w25^because in them was completed the wrath - of god.
66.15:2.w1-w35^and i saw [something] like a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those conquering over the beast, and of the image of it, and over the number of the name of it, standing upon the sea of the glass, having harps - of god.

66.15:8.w23-w30^until were completed the seven plagues of the seven angels.
66.16:1.w1-w11^and i heard [a] loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels,

66.16:12.w15-w19^and was dried up the water of it,
66.16:12.w20-w29^so that might be prepared the way of the kings - of the rising of the sun.
66.16:13.w1-w24^and i saw [coming] out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, spirits three unclean, like frogs;
66.16:14.w1-w6^they are for spirits of demons performing signs,

66.16:17.w21_2^saying,
66.16:17.w22_2^it is done!
66.16:18.w1-w7^and there were flashes of lightning, and voices, and thunders;
66.16:18.w8-w11^and an earthquake there was great,
66.16:18.w9^an earthquake

66.16:21.w1-w12^and a hail great, about a talent weight, comes down out of - heaven upon the men.
66.16:21.w13-w23^and blasphemed the men - god on account of the plague of the hail,
66.16:21.w24-w30^for severe is the plague of it exceedingly.

66.9:6.w18_2^to die,
66.9:6.w19-w24^and shall flee - death from them.

66.9:7.w8-w10^having been prepared for battle,

66.9:7.w20-w26^and the faces of them like [the] faces of men.

66.9:8.w7-w13^and the teeth of them like [those] of lions were.

66.9:9.w7-w20^and the sound of the wings of them [was] as [the] sound of chariots of horses many rushing into battle.
66.9:9.w18-w20^rushing into battle.
