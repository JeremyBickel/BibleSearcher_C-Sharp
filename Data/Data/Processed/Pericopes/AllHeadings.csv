and for idolatry
and for infidelity
and for Jerusalem under the parable of a wasted vine

and goes again beyond Jordan where many believe on him
and gracious works
and granting Elisha his request is taken up by a fiery chariot into heaven
and grow up in Christ
and hanged
and has by her Jezreel
and has compassion on the multitude
and he expects the like affection from them again
and he is brought forth
and he ornaments for them
And he proceeds in stirring them up to a bountiful alms as being but a kind of sowing of seed
and heals all that touch him
and his blessing on the good
and his desire to come to them
and his incomparableness
and his life free from snares
and his love towards her
and his patience in hope
and his prosperity into calamity
and his wonderful deliverance of his people
and hospitality
and how it ought to be used
and how miraculously he was converted and called to his apostleship
and how oft to forgive them
and how ready he is to glorify Christ either by his life or death
and how the troubles and persecutions which he daily endured for the same did redound to the praise of Gods power
and how to be perfect
and husbands ought to love their wives
and Hymenaeus and Alexander
and idols are vanity
and illustrates the matter by the parable of old bottles and worn garments
and in divers varieties of life
and in expectation of it and of the general judgment he labours to keep a good conscience
and in our trials not to impute our weakness or sins to him
and in riches
and in sins of ignorance
and in the land
and in the service of Christ and in all kinds of sufferings for his ministry far superior

and more fully describes the manners of those profane and blasphemous seducers whereby they may be the better known and avoided
and mourns for Abner
and Nathan seconds her
and not to be confident in the good success of worldly business but mindful ever of the uncertainty of this life to commit ourselves and all our affairs to Gods providence
and not to believe the dreams of their prophets
and not to boast of faith where no deeds are
and not to despise the little ones
and not to love the world
and not to observe circumcision

and shews her great favour
and shews their judgments
and shows that we are the sons of Abraham by the freewoman
and shows what he was before his calling
and shows who are blessed
and shows who are his brother sister and mother
and shows who is his brother sister and mother
and slays the giant
and so ascends into heaven
and so concludes the epistle
and so far excels the wisdom of this world and human sense that the natural man cannot understand it
and so far more excellent than the priests of Aarons order
And so he concludes with prayer and salutations
and so with them of Ekron when it was brought thither
and soon after he concludes
and spoils and carries away the treasures
and succour of the same body
and suffer shipwreck
and suffering his feet to be washed and anointed by a woman who was a sinner he shows how he is a friend to sinners to forgive them their sins upon their repentance
and suffers them to go into the swine
and swallowed by a fish
and teaches servants how to obey their masters
and tells of Elijahs coming and office
and thanksgiving for the Ephesians
and that all both Jew and Gentile that believe shall not be confounded
and that all outward ceremonies were ordained according to the heavenly pattern to last but for a time
and that because he vouchsafed to take our nature upon him
and that he resisted Peter and told him the reason
and that men should worship it
and that the bond thereof ought not lightly to be dissolved
and that the Gentiles shall receive the word and believe
and that the minister ought to live by the Gospel
and that the rest of the apostles had wrought many miracles
and that they live not in sin who are so justified
and that they shall return with grace after seventy years
and that Titus was not circumcised
and the abuse taxed
and the burnt offering for himself
and the calling of Jeremiah
and the candle
and the children of Israel appoint the six cities of refuge
and the condemnation for unbelief
and the conquest of Egypt by Nebuchadrezzar
and the day ofjudgment in the days of youth are to be thought on
and the desolation of Zedekiah and the rest
and the desperate simplicity of a young wanton
and the destruction of the rest
and the eternity of wisdom
and the fall thereof for pride
and the fruits of the Spirit
and the general corruption
and the good success thereof
and the gracious benefits of the church
and the great blessings after a short affliction
and the happy success which God gave to his preaching in all places
and the husbandmen who slew such as were sent to them
and the increase of Gods blessings
and the judgments for the same
and the Levites with Nethinims which dwelt in Jerusalem
and the manner of his coming to judgment
and the manner thereof
and the marriages with the strange wives
and the meaning thereof
and the Merarites divided by lot
and the ordinances of the altar
and the passion of Christ
and the passover
and the peace of Christs kingdom
and the people captivated
and the people for marrying strange wives
and the rational creatures to praise God
and the substitution of Eliakim prefiguring the kingdom of Christ
and the temporal covenant with the fathers by the eternal covenant of the Gospel
and the ten horns
and their incorrigibleness shall end in affliction
and their lands except the priests to Pharaoh
and their punishments
and their security
and their spoils shall be holy
and their sure preservation
and their untempered morter
and then concludes with prayer and salutation
and thereupon repeats his former exhortation and prays for them
and therewithal uses divers reasons for the comforting of them in persecution whereof the chief is taken from the righteous judgment of God
and they are delivered
And this he shows by many reasons
and threatens destruction to the wicked
and thrice denied of Peter
and to a reformation of their sins before his coming
and to be filled with the Spirit
and to bear him like affection as he does to them
and to bear one anothers burden
and to build an altar of whole stones
and to decline the ways of carnal Christians
and to forgive one another
and to fortitude in persecution
and to free themselves from bondage
and to have nothing to do with those seducers that bring not the true doctrine of Christ Jesus
and to him was that grace given that he should preach it
and to his disciples
and to imitate him
and to Jerusalem
and to labour after perfection
and to mourn
and to persist in the form and truth of that doctrine which he had learned of him
and to preserve the godly
and to reduce a straying brother to the truth
and to rejoice for their salvation by God
and to repentance
and to resist the cruel adversary the devil
and to shun wickedness
and to suffer persecution
And to that end are diversely bestowed
and to the apostles own eternal glory
And to the end that Timothy might not fail in doing his duty he furnishes him with divers precepts belonging thereto
and to the keeping of the sabbath
and to trust not in themselves but in God
and to what end Saint Paul wrote to Timothy of these things
And unto this last exhortation is annexed a brief description of the resurrection and second coming of Christ to judgment
and upbraids the Kings house
and upon injustice
and upon Israel
and upon the men of Anathoth for conspiring to kill him
and upon the Philistines
and vengeance on his enemies
and victory of the church
and warns them to be constant in the faith of Christ who is the true Son of God by the eyewitness of the apostles beholding his majesty and by the testimony of the Father and the prophets
and what good of the Spirit
and what he did immediately after it
and what his mercy toward his church
and what manner of men they be
and what may not be eaten
and whereof to admonish the rich
and with seven loaves and a few little fishes feeds four thousand men beside women and children
and with the churchs consent ordain seven chosen men to the office of deaconship
and withal taxing them for reaching out themselves beyond their compass and vaunting themselves of other mens labours
and women with their heads uncovered
and wonderful providence of God
and yet he should deny him thrice
and yet the law is not abolished
