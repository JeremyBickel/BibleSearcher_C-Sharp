32081 ^ 1 ^ him in the wilderness
32082 ^ 1 ^ and grieve
32083 ^ 1 ^ him in the desert
32084 ^ 1 ^ yea they turned back
32085 ^ 1 ^ and limited
32086 ^ 1 ^ nor the day
32087 ^ 1 ^ and had turned
32088 ^ 1 ^ and their floods

32096 ^ 1 ^ with hail
32097 ^ 1 ^ and their sycamore trees
32098 ^ 1 ^ with frost
32099 ^ 1 ^ he gave up

32107 ^ 1 ^ but gave
32108 ^ 1 ^ over to the pestilence
32109 ^ 1 ^ in the tabernacles
32110 ^ 1 ^ but made his own people

32115 ^ 1 ^ which his right hand
32116 ^ 1 ^ had purchased
32117 ^ 1 ^ them and divided
32118 ^ 1 ^ and made the tribes
32119 ^ 1 ^ yet they tempted
32120 ^ 1 ^ but turned back
32121 ^ 1 ^ and dealt unfaithfully
32122 ^ 1 ^ like their fathers
32123 ^ 1 ^ they were turned aside

32989 ^ 1 ^ at his pleasure
32990 ^ 1 ^ and teach his senators
32991 ^ 1 ^ also came into
32992 ^ 1 ^ and he increased
32993 ^ 1 ^ and made them stronger
32994 ^ 1 ^ than their enemies
32995 ^ 1 ^ to deal subtlely
32996 ^ 1 ^ with his servants
32997 ^ 1 ^ they showed
32998 ^ 1 ^ among them and wonders
32999 ^ 1 ^ and made it dark
33000 ^ 1 ^ and they rebelled
33001 ^ 1 ^ brought forth frogs in abundance
33002 ^ 1 ^ and lice
33003 ^ 1 ^ them hail
33004 ^ 1 ^ for rain
33005 ^ 1 ^ and flaming

33008 ^ 1 ^ the herbs
33009 ^ 1 ^ of their ground
33010 ^ 1 ^ also all
33011 ^ 1 ^ he brought them forth
33012 ^ 1 ^ also with silver
33013 ^ 1 ^ one feeble
33014 ^ 1 ^ person among their tribes
33015 ^ 1 ^ when they departed
33016 ^ 1 ^ he spread
33017 ^ 1 ^ the people asked
33018 ^ 1 ^ and satisfied
33019 ^ 1 ^ in the dry places
33020 ^ 1 ^ them the lands
33021 ^ 1 ^ and they inherited
33022 ^ 1 ^ they might observe
33023 ^ 1 ^ his laws
33024 ^ 1 ^ can utter
33025 ^ 1 ^ the mighty acts
33026 ^ 1 ^ who can show forth
33027 ^ 1 ^ and he that doeth
33028 ^ 1 ^ with the favor
33029 ^ 1 ^ that thou bearest unto thy people
33030 ^ 1 ^ o visit
33031 ^ 1 ^ me with thy salvation
33032 ^ 1 ^ that i may see
33033 ^ 1 ^ of thy chosen
33034 ^ 1 ^ that i may rejoice
33035 ^ 1 ^ in the gladness
33036 ^ 1 ^ of thy nation
33037 ^ 1 ^ that i may glory
33038 ^ 1 ^ we have committed iniquity
33039 ^ 1 ^ of thy mercies
33040 ^ 1 ^ but provoked
33041 ^ 1 ^ even at the red
33042 ^ 1 ^ nevertheless he saved
33043 ^ 1 ^ them for his names sake
33044 ^ 1 ^ that he might make
33045 ^ 1 ^ his mighty power
33046 ^ 1 ^ to be known
33047 ^ 1 ^ also and it was dried up
33048 ^ 1 ^ so he led
33049 ^ 1 ^ them through the depths
33050 ^ 1 ^ as through the wilderness
33051 ^ 1 ^ them  and redeemed
33052 ^ 1 ^ then believed
33053 ^ 1 ^ they his words
33054 ^ 1 ^ they soon
33055 ^ 1 ^ forgot
33056 ^ 1 ^ they waited
33057 ^ 1 ^ for his counsel
33058 ^ 1 ^ but lusted exceedingly
33059 ^ 1 ^ them their request
33060 ^ 1 ^ but sent
33061 ^ 1 ^ into their soul
33062 ^ 1 ^ they envied
33063 ^ 1 ^ also in the camp
33064 ^ 1 ^ the saint
33065 ^ 1 ^ and swallowed up
33066 ^ 1 ^ of abiram
33067 ^ 1 ^ in their company
33068 ^ 1 ^ the molten image
33069 ^ 1 ^ thus they changed
33070 ^ 1 ^ into the similitude
33071 ^ 1 ^ they forgot
33072 ^ 1 ^ which had done
33073 ^ 1 ^ wondrous works
33074 ^ 1 ^ that he would destroy
33075 ^ 1 ^ them had not
33076 ^ 1 ^ him in the breach
33077 ^ 1 ^ lest he should destroy
33078 ^ 1 ^ yea they despised
33079 ^ 1 ^ but murmured
33080 ^ 1 ^ therefore he lifted up
33081 ^ 1 ^ against them to overthrow
33082 ^ 1 ^ also among the nations
33083 ^ 1 ^ and to scatter
33084 ^ 1 ^ them in the lands
33085 ^ 1 ^ they joined themselves
33086 ^ 1 ^ also unto baalpeor
33087 ^ 1 ^ and ate
33088 ^ 1 ^ thus they provoked him to anger
33089 ^ 1 ^ with their inventions
33090 ^ 1 ^ broke in
33091 ^ 1 ^ and executed judgment
33092 ^ 1 ^ and so the plague
33093 ^ 1 ^ and that was counted
33094 ^ 1 ^ unto him for righteousness
33095 ^ 1 ^ they angered
33096 ^ 1 ^ him also at
33097 ^ 1 ^ so that it went ill
33098 ^ 1 ^ they provoked
33099 ^ 1 ^ so that he spoke unadvisedly
33100 ^ 1 ^ concerning whom
33101 ^ 1 ^ but were mingled
33102 ^ 1 ^ yea they sacrificed
33103 ^ 1 ^ even the blood
33104 ^ 1 ^ and of their daughters
33105 ^ 1 ^ unto the idols
33106 ^ 1 ^ was polluted
33107 ^ 1 ^ thus were they defiled
33108 ^ 1 ^ with their own works
33109 ^ 1 ^ with their own inventions
33110 ^ 1 ^ therefore was the wrath
33111 ^ 1 ^ insomuch that he abhorred
33112 ^ 1 ^ his own inheritance
33113 ^ 1 ^ and they that hated
33114 ^ 1 ^ them ruled
33115 ^ 1 ^ also oppressed
33116 ^ 1 ^ them and they were brought into subjection
33117 ^ 1 ^ did he deliver
33118 ^ 1 ^ them but they
33119 ^ 1 ^ him with their counsel
33120 ^ 1 ^ and were brought low
33121 ^ 1 ^ nevertheless he regarded
33122 ^ 1 ^ and he remembered
33123 ^ 1 ^ for them his covenant
33124 ^ 1 ^ them also to be pitied
33125 ^ 1 ^ those that carried them captives
33126 ^ 1 ^ unto thy holy
33127 ^ 1 ^ and to triumph
33128 ^ 1 ^ let the redeemed
33129 ^ 1 ^ so  whom
33130 ^ 1 ^ them out of the lands
33131 ^ 1 ^ in a solitary
33132 ^ 1 ^ and he led them forth
33133 ^ 1 ^ by the right
33134 ^ 1 ^ that they might go
33135 ^ 1 ^ he satisfieth
33136 ^ 1 ^ the longing
33137 ^ 1 ^ with goodness
33138 ^ 1 ^ such as sit
33139 ^ 1 ^ and in the shadow of death
33140 ^ 1 ^ being bound
33141 ^ 1 ^ in affliction
33142 ^ 1 ^ they rebelled against
33143 ^ 1 ^ and contemned
33144 ^ 1 ^ therefore he brought down
33145 ^ 1 ^ with labor
33146 ^ 1 ^ they fell down
33147 ^ 1 ^ he brought them out
33148 ^ 1 ^ their bands
33149 ^ 1 ^ of their transgression
33150 ^ 1 ^ and because of their iniquities
33151 ^ 1 ^ and they draw near
33152 ^ 1 ^ and he saveth
33153 ^ 1 ^ them from their destructions
33154 ^ 1 ^ and let them sacrifice
33155 ^ 1 ^ in the deep
33156 ^ 1 ^ for he commandeth
33157 ^ 1 ^ and raiseth
33158 ^ 1 ^ the stormy
33159 ^ 1 ^ which lifteth up
33160 ^ 1 ^ they mount up
33161 ^ 1 ^ to the heaven
33162 ^ 1 ^ again to the depths
33163 ^ 1 ^ because of trouble
33164 ^ 1 ^ they reel to and fro
33165 ^ 1 ^ and stagger
33166 ^ 1 ^ like a drunken man
33167 ^ 1 ^ and are at their wits end
33168 ^ 1 ^ and he bringeth them out
33169 ^ 1 ^ of their distresses
33170 ^ 1 ^ the storm
33171 ^ 1 ^ so that the waves
33172 ^ 1 ^ thereof are still
33173 ^ 1 ^ then are they glad
33174 ^ 1 ^ so he bringeth
33175 ^ 1 ^ their desired
33176 ^ 1 ^ let them exalt
33177 ^ 1 ^ him also in the congregation
33178 ^ 1 ^ him in the assembly
33179 ^ 1 ^ into a wilderness
33180 ^ 1 ^ and the watersprings
33181 ^ 1 ^ into dry ground
33182 ^ 1 ^ a fruitful
33183 ^ 1 ^ into barrenness
33184 ^ 1 ^ into watersprings
33185 ^ 1 ^ he maketh the hungry to dwell
33186 ^ 1 ^ that they may prepare
33187 ^ 1 ^ for habitation
33188 ^ 1 ^ which may yield
33189 ^ 1 ^ of increase
33190 ^ 1 ^ he blesseth
33191 ^ 1 ^ them also so that they are multiplied
33192 ^ 1 ^ and suffereth not
33193 ^ 1 ^ to decrease
33194 ^ 1 ^ again they are minished
33195 ^ 1 ^ through oppression
33196 ^ 1 ^ yet setteth he the poor on high
33197 ^ 1 ^ from affliction
33198 ^ 1 ^ him families
33199 ^ 1 ^ it  and rejoice
33200 ^ 1 ^ and will observe
33201 ^ 1 ^ things  even they shall understand
33202 ^ 1 ^ the lovingkindness
33203 ^ 1 ^ with my glory
33204 ^ 1 ^ is mine manasseh
33205 ^ 1 ^ will i triumph
33206 ^ 1 ^ thou  o god

33214 ^ 1 ^ me they have spoken
33215 ^ 1 ^ me with a lying
33216 ^ 1 ^ also with words
