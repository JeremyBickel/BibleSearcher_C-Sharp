Romans Road is not a physical road, but a series of Bible verses from the book of Romans laying out God's plan of salvation. When arranged in order, these verses form an easy, systematic way of explaining the biblical message of salvation in Jesus Christ.
Step 1 - Romans Road begins with the truth that everyone needs salvation because all people have sinned. No one gets a free ride, because every person is guilty before God. We all fall short of the mark. (Romans 3:9-12, 23)
Step 2 - The price (or consequence) of sin is death. The punishment we all deserve is both physical and spiritual death, thus we need God's salvation to escape the deadly, eternal consequences of our sin. (Romans 6:23)
Step 3 - Jesus Christ died for our sins. His death paid the full price for our salvation. Through the death and resurrection of God's own Son, the debt we owed was satisfied. (Romans 5:8)
Step 4 - We (all sinners) receive salvation and eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ. Anyone who places their trust in Jesus receives the promise of eternal life. (Romans 10:9-10, 13)
Step 5 - Salvation through Jesus Christ brings us into a relationship of peace with God. When we accept God's gift, we have the reward of knowing we'll never be condemned for our sins. (Romans 5:1 ; 8:1, 38-39)
