now i beseech you brethren mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned and avoid  them 

for they that are such serve not our lord jesus christ but their own belly and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple 

for your obedience is come abroad unto all men i am glad therefore on your behalf  but yet i would have you wise  unto that which is good and simple concerning evil 

and the god of peace shall bruise satan under your feet shortly 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~BIG VIEW~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some people cause division and offense 
-Compared with right doctrine
They use fair speech to deceive
-So they're not this other potential group that uses harsh language and offends those who pervert right doctrine
-they do it for their own flesh
THEREFORE
Separate from them
BECAUSE
Even though you're well-known for obedience, you should be reminded to have constant experience of good but not of evil in your group
FURTHERMORE
-By Implication of the rest of the context: God (Who uses holy separation for peace) will use you to damage Satan's servants and get rid of them from your group
--OR--
-As another topic: God will bring you peace in general and use you in an assult on satanic forces you will meet in some situation in the near future

Notice how the general possibility is similar to the one connected to the context, but it's potential connections (the whys and wherefores) dangle and things are generalized upward

Hang all the other details on this (and be satisfied if it's useful in practice for any or many reasons).
